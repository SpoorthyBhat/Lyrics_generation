 You are the air that we call friends.  
 In his touch.  
 I gotta keep these cheeks dry today.  
 Gotta be a better way to part.  
 Nikki its you you you.  
 I dont want to live without your love.  
 I feel so sad.  
 Its too much pressure on me.  
 I know youre mine pride and joy.  
 He sang like a beautiful girl.  
 Thats my prerogative.  
 Its my life.  
 And im so glad were through.  
 Now i have you here today for a bit more ductile like me.  
 Cause i dont want to fall on the floor and shake that ass.  
 They gon hear you outside from the outside.  
 But im hurtin while im with you.  
 With you.  
 And now youre gonna lie.  
 Sometimes when im mad you dont wanna play with mine.  
 And when you go.  
 I need your loving arms again.  
 And its the mystery of love.  
 When the going gets rough.  
 Love isnt on your daily agenda.  
 No matter what it takes then let it go let it go let it all go were gonna. 
 
 Country:
 
 You are the one.  
 Whos loving you.  
 Im not afraid of stormy weather.  
 She does not have an end.  
 To anyone who called me friend.  
 I dont know what to "do hoo".  
 All day and up into the sky.  
 And from new york to la.  
 Well i know my destination.  
 If i never do look sour.  
 Take me away from home.  
 No we dont so tell us bout them angels and how they got to where i dont know.  
 But then theres those nights.  
 Are now at an end.  
 But finish it did with a bang and a whisper.  
 The work is all done theres nothing they can do.  
 Im falling in love with finds her so easy to hold.  
 Or are you just digging for gold.  
 Big house limousines.  
 Fine wines fine cuisines.  
 Vale and vegas twice a year.  
 And i can hear my saviour calling i can hear the thunder roll.  
 Theres no room in my iron bed.  
 Youre looking cold and tired when the evening sun goes down.  
 Well i never had the time he could. 
 
 Folk:
 
 You are the ones.  
 You are on the sea".  
 Well i never was wasteful.  
 With the pretty girl up on the board.  
 It read its good times here but better on down the highway.  
 People think im a mermaid but i never do the deed.  
 Its dangerous too dangerous.  
 I use big words.  
 But i hope it digs in.  
 Digs in caving in from the weight.  
 I hope that if you dream.  
 You dream of me emma lee.  
 Lord she want what she cant have.  
 Emma lee she got that heyo ha ah ha a ha yo.  
 She calm the waters and she step on board.  
 I dreamt of gold and hidden lands.  
 Mary i dont want to wreck your life.  
 Are you tonight.  
 I will light a candle.  
 Your heart is tired.  
 If the king of angels.  
 Sing in exultation.  
 Sing all that hear in heaven gods holy word.  
 Give to our father glory in the highest.  
 O come let us adore him.  
 O come let us adore him.  
 Christ the lord.  
 And i can.
