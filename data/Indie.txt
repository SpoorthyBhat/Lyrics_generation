and that was the beginning of my misery <eos> he called for a candle to light him to bed <eos> aand likewise a silk hankerchief to tie up his hair <eos> to tie up his hair as sailors will do <eos> "and third my pretty polly will you come too" <eos> now this may seem young and foolish she thought it no harm <eos> to lie on the bed to keep herself warm <eos> and what was done there i shall never disclose <eos> but i wish that short night had been seven long years <eos> so early next morning this sailor arose <eos> and into my pockets guineas did throw <eos> saying"tthis i will give and more i will do <eos> if youll be my polly wherever i go" <eos> now if its a boy hell fight for the king <eos> and if its a girl shell wear a gold ring <eos> shell wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame <eos> and remember my service in rosemary lane <eos> when i was in service in rosemary lane <eos> i won the good will of my master amberdine <eos> until a young sailor came there to stay <eos> and that was the beginning of my misery durutti column cover <eos> all i wanted was your time <eos> all you ever gave me was tomorrow <eos> all i wanted was your time <eos> all you ever gave me was tomorrow <eos> and tomorrow never comes <eos> tomorrow never comes <eos> tomorrow never comes <eos> tomorrow never comes <eos> tomorrow never comes <eos> people stood in a line with flowers <eos> they were only waiting for the moment <eos> and i know the feeling so well <eos> ive been waiting for you for so long <eos> and i know the feeling so well <eos> ive been waiting for you for so long well ive opened up my veins too many times <eos> and the poisons in my heart and in my mind <eos> poisons in my bloodstream poisons in my pride <eos> im after rebellion ill settle for lies <eos> is it any wonder that my minds on fire <eos> imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do <eos> is it any wonder that the jokes an iron <eos> and the jokes on you <eos> experiments that failed too many times <eos> transformations that were too hard to find <eos> poisons in my bloodstream poisons in my pride <eos> im after rebellion ill settle for lies <eos> yes i know the secrets of the iron and mind <eos> theyre trinity acts a mineral fire <eos> yes i know the secrets of the circuitry mind <eos> its a flaming wonder telepath <eos> well ive opened up my veins too many times <eos> and the poisons in my heart and in my mind <eos> poisons in my bloodstream poisons in my pride <eos> im after rebellion ill settle for lies <eos> is it any wonder that my minds on fire <eos> imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do <eos> is it any wonder that the jokes an iron <eos> and the jokes on the sun inside your eyes sends me impossibly <eos> through seasons spilling fluid time like arteries of gold <eos> beside this tree of oak and moss most innocently <eos> the sedentary song describes our willingness to lie <eos> between your red and golden skin most innocently <eos> together like two meadows one too soon our course is run <eos> in softness as in stone we find regretably <eos> the solitary song describes our willingness to die black is the color of my true loves hair <eos> his face is like some wondrous fair <eos> with the prettiest face and the neatest hands <eos> i love the ground whereon he stands <eos> i love my love <eos> and whell he knows <eos> i love the ground whereon he goes <eos> if you know <eos> <eos> i go to the clyde for to mourn and weep <eos> but satisfied i never can sleep <eos> ill write him a letter just a few short lines <eos> ill suffer death one thousand times <eos> black is the color of my true loves hair <eos> his face is like some wondrous fair <eos> with the prettiest face and the neatest hands <eos> i love the ground whereon he stands take this scarred body <eos> annoint his heirs <eos> take a dollar for the crossing <eos> from coins in his meal <eos> souls slight of coin <eos> slight of name <eos> then ill meet you at the back gate <eos> and greet you just the same <eos> take to my side <eos> and well walk on <eos> to where the frost of the dead king <eos> weigh heavy on the vine <eos> long its been said <eos> that the worlds <eos> of a man be his woman <eos> and his lands have retainers weve been riding all night and the skies that diminish are right to be known <eos> weve been finding insight in what we knew to be right from the day we were born <eos> every day is the last only further in time from the will of the past <eos> so we circle and strive and reverse when we drive so well never arrive <eos> we were silent before but were not anymore now well even the score <eos> well describe and dissect every secret effect that lay hid behind doors <eos> there was time in the past to describe or outlast all that cluttered and cast <eos> a dispirting light through our shallowing nights soon will never be right sleepless and struggling to pry <eos> apart the memories you try <eos> so hard to hide from the light <eos> over this long lonely night <eos> thoughts linger on like a rash <eos> like a slow motion car crash <eos> they clutter like moths to a flame <eos> singeing your angular frame <eos> like clouds and the stars here from sight <eos> feeling adventurous you might <eos> float free at dizzying heights <eos> nothing can reach you at night cease to know or to tell <eos> or to see or to be your own <eos> cease to know or to tell <eos> or to see or to be your own <eos> have someone elses will as your own <eos> have someone elses will as your own <eos> you are beautiful and you are alone <eos> you are beautiful and you are alone <eos> often the adolescent plague <eos> reward your grace <eos> often the adolescent plague <eos> reward your grace <eos> confuse your hunger capture the fake <eos> confuse your hunger capture the fake <eos> banish the faceless reward your grace <eos> banish the faceless reward your grace when you said farewell <eos> i didnt think youd really go <eos> so here comes the sad spell <eos> as my heart expands from the gallows <eos> but this pain i was feeling <eos> was far from real <eos> i thought you were teasing <eos> i let go of what seemed <eos> ill spread it out <eos> wildflower <eos> wildflower <eos> you picked me apart <eos> forget me not <eos> my petals fell <eos> but never begin to rot <eos> so now you all know what was i <eos> this flower i speak of was no buttercup <eos> but this joy im now feeling <eos> is much more real <eos> i begin again as a seedling <eos> running fire to the field <eos> ill spread my joy <eos> wildflower <eos> wildflower <eos> wildflowers flowers <eos> wildflowers flowers <eos> through the pain we merge so much more power <eos> so thank you wildflower i know eventually there will be <eos> true love for you and me <eos> i can feel it in my bones as life unfurls <eos> and i know your face is but a distant memory <eos> so why do i wonder <eos> wonder <eos> wonder why <eos> when everything is already <eos> perfectly aligned <eos> you aint mine <eos> why <eos> why <eos> oh my oh my <eos> perhaps that is why <eos> perhaps that is why <eos> youre not mine <eos> so for now as i look at my reflection <eos> im still holding my own hand <eos> i love him no more than the love that could i ever understand <eos> so its not so bad <eos> its not so bad <eos> its not so bad <eos> have i ever seen in your eyes <eos> how will i recognize you <eos> have i ever seen in your eyes <eos> how will i recognize you <eos> so still i wonder wonder wonder why <eos> when everything is already perfectly aligned <eos> you aint mine <eos> why <eos> why <eos> oh my <eos> oh my <eos> perhaps that is why <eos> perhaps that is why <eos> youre not mine everything comes back to this <eos> every embrace every perfect kiss <eos> you try to scare me with those clenched fists <eos> but i told you darling i cant handle this <eos> at least now you know <eos> see i was telling the truth <eos> and this world i walk trough walks trough me too <eos> well i only like his hat <eos> not him <eos> his hat <eos> not him <eos> not him <eos> not him <eos> him <eos> everyday i pretend <eos> i dont see you but in the end <eos> ill admit in fact you are <eos> all i see but must ignore <eos> someday soon ill be how i used to <eos> in this world i walk trough walks trough me too <eos> well i only like his hat <eos> not him <eos> well i only like his hat <eos> not him <eos> not him <eos> you ask me why is that <eos> i say nothing with a false grin <eos> false grin <eos> false grin <eos> but really im too scared <eos> to love again <eos>

hold on to this fight <eos> while i stay in all day shutting away these thoughts i have to hide <eos> but im kidding myself i know that nothing will change the way i feel inside <eos> these pages of gold that we have in store <eos> in all minds oh <eos> telling me otherwise <eos> they say dont give in to the unheard cry <eos> dont give in to the unheard cry <eos> oh oh oh <eos> a year has passed and i still am engrossed how i feel i forget <eos> if its such a big ask to be granted a day <eos> when theres no need to fret <eos> then suddenly you cease to love me i was so silly to think i was free <eos> i worry too much its true i miss your touch <eos> but i cant be a part of this villainy <eos> for these pages of gold that we have in store <eos> in all minds oh <eos> telling me otherwise <eos> they say dont give in to unheard cry <eos> dont give in to the unheard cry <eos> oh oh oh <eos> if id were to love another ill pretend it doesnt bother me if id were to love another ill pretend it doesnt bother me for now its been too long for me to expect anything oh oh oh oh oh why am i so scared of what you think of me never coming back <eos> oh i despise the way that you say empathy is what i lack <eos> you tried to just blame me <eos> but baby you know thats lunacy <eos> to still say it repeatedly til it haunted me <eos> that i betrayed you <eos> betrayed you <eos> you said that i betrayed you <eos> betrayed you <eos> im bewildered by how things can change and i still remain the same <eos> how can people succumb to such ways <eos> the thought makes me go insane <eos> you wanted me to come back but now im under attack and youre all waiting for me to crack <eos> and you said that <eos> i betrayed you <eos> betrayed you <eos> you said that i betrayed you <eos> betrayed you

afraid of my past <eos> i want to confront all my new tasks <eos> show me the river where we swam <eos> show me the miles that we ran <eos> from ourselves <eos> and nothing more <eos> i think i do see my life <eos> its so different once its been shown in its new light <eos> there is no way to describe the way i feel <eos> but for once i can hold on to something real <eos> show me that ive become <eos> something that is parallel to when i was young <eos> show me how i am today <eos> because i am not sure what else does remain <eos> show me the places where we died <eos> show me the places that

with me <eos> i keep you close to my heart <eos> give me one more kiss before the boys arrive <eos> nashville to san francisco is a hell of a drive <eos> but dont worry the lord is good when the road is wrong <eos> chorus <eos> and well be back before you know you know it <eos> lalalala lalalala <eos> i said you know you know it <eos> lalalala lalalala <eos> woo <eos> verse <eos> all the pretty people and the places ive seen <eos> make up for every dollar cause im living the dream <eos> i aint worried ill be fine <eos> because the tank aint empty but its feeling low <eos> im sorry san francisco but i just got to go home <eos> to my baby because shes holding it down <eos> chorus <eos> but well be back before you know you know it <eos> lalalala lalalala <eos> i said you know you know it <eos> lalalala lalalala <eos> bridge <eos> but when the days grow long shes alright hey <eos> every night i know that shes still mine <eos> but dont you break my heart <eos> youre the only

could lose it in a moment <eos> so i dare not close my eyes <eos> ill watch fear fall with the sunset <eos> and see hope rise with the tide <eos> and when the pain is true <eos> sometimes these troubles prove that im alive <eos> my eyes are open <eos> my heart is beating <eos> my lungs are full <eos> and my bodys breathing <eos> im moving forward <eos> i found my freedom <eos> i found the life that gave me reason to live <eos> as this dusty road now settles <eos> and i see what lay before <eos> every tear that held a broken dream <eos> is now shattered on the floor <eos> and now bursting forth in splendor <eos> are the blossoms of second tries <eos> because dreams that bear the mark of love <eos> are dreams that never die <eos> sometimes <eos> life can feel so unkind <eos> sorrow wont define me <eos> so just reminds my soul <eos> my soul are you half empty <eos> why dont you fill up <eos> theres no sense in holding onto something broken <eos> did you lose something <eos> or someone you love <eos> youve still got that story tell it every morning <eos> driving down a road down a road thats rolling <eos> all the lovely memories you hearts been holding <eos> nothing silhouettes till the lights come on <eos> nothing silhouettes till the lights come on <eos> driving down a road a road thats hidden <eos> all your faithful memories your faith for living <eos> nothing silhouettes till the lights come on <eos> nothing silhouettes till the lights come on <eos> so come on <eos> nothing is perfect <eos> for that theres no cure <eos> so dont you start to bury the good with the bad and the ugly <eos> driving down a road down a road thats rollin <eos> all the lovely memories you hearts been holding <eos> nothing silhouettes till the lights come on <eos> nothing

<eos> and your bats wont bend <eos> he said you call me up my cousin manhattan aint got nothing on a good friend <eos> and i thanked him for his great escape <eos> but i think im staying here <eos> cause theres bills to miss and theres plans to break <eos> and nobody ever would stay awake back home <eos> well she wrote her name <eos> with a mont blanc pen <eos> she said you call me when you need me manhattan gets so rough without a good friend <eos> and the ones who break they dont know to bend <eos> so dont get too confident too quickly manhattan chews you up when you pretend <eos> and i thanked her for her sage advice <eos> but im doing okay here <eos> because all these restaurants are overpriced <eos> they all stay open late at night <eos> and mistakes are nice they make me feel at home <eos> well i called my sister in the summer said im thinking about moving here <eos> she said do it now before you get a job and get married cant go nowhere <eos> but now i cant go nowhere because theres too many chances here <eos> i must admit i miss my friends but im staying here she never drove never climbed never walked another road <eos> and ever since i can remember in november shes a wilted rose <eos> but in the summer she lights right up from her head down to her toes <eos> call me crazy but i blow a little kiss when i go <eos> and her necklace is simple it compliments her clothes <eos> any day shell pick a fight or pick a flower no one ever knows <eos> she turns inches to miles when i watch her in the snow <eos> call me crazy i blow a little kiss when i go <eos> little face little face shes got a pretty little face <eos> little face little face shes got a pretty little face <eos> everybodys talking bout her <eos> little face little face shes got a pretty little face <eos> little face little face shes got a pretty little face <eos> throw a party and see the pretty presents that she brings <eos> and id be lying if i said shes never stolen anything <eos> she may not know the finest wines but she knows a fast way home <eos> so call me crazy but i blow a little kiss when i go <eos> chorus <eos> oh and time time time in time she drifts away <eos> every time ive gone away <eos> the freckles change upon her face <eos> repeat <eos> but the previous arrangement i never forget <eos> cause me and her we go together like coffee and cigarettes <eos> i pack up quickly and never can wait to hit the road <eos> call me crazy but i blow a little kiss when i go he ties his bags around his thighs <eos> newspaper bags filled with newspaper lies <eos> and combs his hair straightens his tie <eos> but the people still stare the people want to know why <eos> he chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life <eos> after all these years when she was alive <eos> he stood in the corner and he built a disguise <eos> now that shes gone the house wont rise <eos> so he sits on a milk crate with a handsaw to the sky <eos> he chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life <eos> so dont call me man dont call me boy anymore <eos> take or leave your crown behind and ill cry your name in war <eos> and theres rocks in windows that michael threw <eos> and this weeks windowits for you <eos> he dropped out of amherst in his second year <eos> and now hes digging holes for the state <eos> and he lays so still in the morning chill <eos> cause hes having trouble sleeping late <eos> and he pours down the concrete on th street <eos> and the children come up slow with open hands <eos> and as they set them in hes ashamed within <eos> cause he knows that once they walk away hell just go fill it up again <eos> he chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life <eos> oh and i should go but can i stay <eos> just one more song and ill be on my way <eos> dont call me man dont call me boy <eos> dont call me man dont call me boy <eos> when he lost his home and his face grew thin <eos> he traded her dresses for a used violin <eos> and when he raised the wood and touched it to his chin <eos> he whispered who i am aint nothing like the wasted man ive been <eos> he chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life <eos> far away we go <eos> we go far away <eos> we go so far that you cant even see us grow take me as i come i come alone <eos> take me as i go im going nowhere <eos> but if theres someone i should me <eos> or someplace i should be i will convene <eos> life if getting hard i hardly work <eos> things are getting soft too soft to hear <eos> if theres a job that i should take <eos> or a sound that i should make i will surrender <eos> everything i thought i needed now <eos> every little thing i own is taped away in cardboard <eos> every little thing i needed new <eos> every single thing i own is taped away <eos> streets i used to take i never use them <eos> footsteps i would trace i never follow <eos> but theres a reason to return <eos> and trails left to burn <eos> i fill my gas tank <eos> i left you all my notes <eos> i left them on the stairs <eos> i left them on the stairs that day with you <eos> i lost my right to vote <eos> i lost it on the stairs <eos> i lost it on the stairs that day with you <eos> my friend for you <eos> so look me up and down im feeling shallow <eos> look me in the eye theres nothing deep <eos> if theres a poet who might know the way my story goes <eos> ill let him finish its been the same old day in this town <eos> and my head wont stop hanging down <eos> no my head wont stop hanging down <eos> its just the kind of day when your friends dont come around <eos> and my head wont stop hanging down <eos> no my head wont stop hanging down <eos> a street gang tried to take my pride tried to take my money and phone <eos> no train no fame cold rain and i forgot my umbrella at home <eos> please ask me my opinion of the war and politicians out wasting my dough <eos> when they tell me that i dont know nothing i just tell them that theres nothing to know <eos> cause its been the same old day in this town <eos> and my head wont stop hanging down <eos> no my head wont stop hanging down <eos> its just the kind of day that your friends dont come around <eos> and my head wont stop hanging down <eos> no my head wont stop hanging down <eos> i grew up in a crate and barrel home and if you could then you certainly can <eos> im a good son good brother good lover but i sure aint much of a man <eos> so you think that you know me boy you think you watched what i became <eos> well you better know that what i do and who i am is never the same <eos> chorus <eos> and the love of a woman aint gonna save my sorry day <eos> i need something between just a near drink of beam and a river to sweep me away <eos> i aint gonna share my bed so you can nod your head and tell me it will be okay <eos> chorus well you called but you never did knock <eos> well you called but my ears they were busy and blocked <eos> so i leaned on the door fell asleep standing tall <eos> and dreamt that your fist might awake me <eos> and the young we can drift far from home <eos> but we never can get very far all alone <eos> on a tower in a cave <eos> just a credit card away <eos> i cant seem to outgrow my history <eos> when i die leave a stone on my grave <eos> thats the place to remember my face <eos> when i die leave a stone on my grave <eos> leave a stone on my grave to remember <eos> she extended her laugh writing fiction in photographs <eos> fake cause its tape but more real than unseen <eos> then she stares at her shape every day like a ghost <eos> whos haunting his son before heaven <eos> there are people i still like to know <eos> and i few who i wouldnt be sad to see go <eos> but im stuck on an aisle thats charted and known <eos> and these bridges wont burn on their own <eos> oh and boy baby boy only seventeen years seventeen <eos> oh and boy baby boy its five less than me <eos> oh and i know so much less than it seems <eos> oh but i can admit to the nothing ive seen when you go take my coat with you <eos> so when it snows ill stay wrapped around your shoulders <eos> when you drink raise your glass to me <eos> and you can think of all the inconvenient ways the days would pass for me and you <eos> and if you sing sing my songs <eos> cause if you sang anyone elses you wont think of me for nearly <eos> as long as i live ill always find your socks in my bed <eos> my bed socks in my bed my bed my little bed <eos> i always find your socks in my bed my bed <eos> ill always find your socks in my bed <eos> and in the morning whisper softly <eos> cause these walls are paper thing <eos> take a pair of my golden toes <eos> and was them in your laundry and ill use them when we sleep on rd <eos> and when were old old and grey <eos> would you properly issue pills into the pillbox that i need for the day <eos> that i die will be the day there arent socks in my bed <eos> chorus <eos> well there was a mouse and i found him in the bathroom of your <eos> second floor apartment but you thought he was adorable <eos> so i watched as he navigated mazes you created using empty paper towel rolls and boots <eos> so if you sing sing my songs <eos> cause if you sing anyone elses you wont think of me for nearly as long <eos> as i live ill always find your socks in my bed dawn is homeless on a suitcase by the train <eos> while city princes hail cabs to beat the rain <eos> stacks of books she never reads <eos> she never begs <eos> theres reservations on her mind and in her head <eos> i spend my days searching for my soul <eos> and as we roar along the truth is left untold <eos> i know my brother came and turned some heads before <eos> but that was then <eos> and this is someone elses war <eos> covered faces on the pictures and the news <eos> are covered faces in my home and in my shoes <eos> a bigger stage should make it quicker than before <eos> but now its jeans not oily key that open doors <eos> all the buildings are selling poison on the street <eos> they probably brand a better ground for better feet <eos> she breaks her back to have the cash to break her face <eos> and even worse my broken heart my broken faith you aint nothing like the book im reading now <eos> cause every time i turn a page i cant put you down <eos> in my pocket when i walk around but baby please dont make a sound <eos> ill call you when i want you to <eos> and im just listening to your voice each time you talk <eos> cause i wont let your story speak a single law <eos> i dress you up ill write your history <eos> make you tell your friends you miss me when im gone

knees feel weak <eos> and i can not speak the truth <eos> the days of being young the days of being free <eos> theyre etched upon my face in every light that you see <eos> the stories i could tell the lies are told as well <eos> what i wouldnt give to live it all again <eos> the years are passing every single day <eos> where did they go did you take them all away <eos> now im older and brave <eos>

myself <eos> but ill be free for what i believe <eos> and i wont sell my soul just to achieve my goal <eos> and ive been holding back the tears dreaming all these years <eos> and i sing from the heart if youll listen to me <eos> everything i do is what i believe <eos> the lights went out across the world <eos> and your house of cards came tumbling down <eos> cause nothing stays and noting sticks <eos> when youre rolling with the lunatics <eos> but my star in the darkest sky <eos> twinkles and watches while the other stars die <eos> upon your empty ears and empty hearts <eos> im always wishing i was someone else <eos> but ive given up the goals i will never sell myself <eos> but ill be free for what i believe <eos> and i wont sell my soul just to achieve my goal <eos> and ive been holding back the tears dreaming all these years <eos> and i sing from the heart if youll listen to me <eos> everything i do is what i believe <eos> the furthest star in the sky <eos> well thats the one that passed me by <eos> i tried to wish upon that star <eos> it didnt get me very far well the sky it always grows and the lights they never fade <eos> theres magic in the air i can feel it everywhere <eos> but the green and the blue come between me and you <eos> but i will always be true to you <eos> and the sun it never shines and the wind it always blows <eos> the treasure that youre looking for is right under your nose <eos> but the green and the blue come between me and you <eos> on a saturday afternoon <eos> i never knew i could feel so lonely <eos> i never knew it would be true <eos> i

<eos> and i dont want to know <eos> i dont want to know where im gonna go <eos> and i dont want to know <eos> i hear it in the hills howling as it comes my way <eos> i feel it in my heart <eos> i saw it in the waves today <eos> rollin and rollin and rollin back to me <eos> so i took a dozen steps and i swore i wouldnt go back <eos> and with a dozen steps i took a dozen breaths and an island came up from beneath <eos> and i dont want to know where im gonna go <eos> i dont want to know <eos> and i dont want to know where im gonna go <eos> i dont want to know <eos> an island in the sea <eos> an island underneath <eos> an island in the sea <eos> an island underneath <eos> oh oh oh <eos> i dont want to know where im gonna go <eos> and i dont want to know <eos> ahh im starting to believe that theres a god and he hates me <eos> im starting to believe that my mom lied about grace and divinity <eos> and it hurts like a sunburn <eos> wakes me up from a deep sleep <eos> i parked on the street out in front of st marys <eos> i watched people leave from the mass in the evening <eos> with my windows down i can still hear the gospel choir singing <eos> i stayed in the car and the light from the stainedglass window didnt reach me <eos> the cicadas are deafening <eos> their voices caught in the breeze <eos> youre not walking next to me <eos> all alone is all ill ever be <eos> youre not walking next to me <eos> im getting by <eos> the only faith i had left was a lie <eos> the leeches died it turns out my blood was poison the whole time senza is a song with your words the words you choose the

terdiam dan kaku tak daya ku kau lupa <eos> apapun kata mereka <eos> biarkan kenangan berbunga di ranting usia <eos> hujan lebat mencurah kini <eos> bagaikan tiada henti <eos> kaulah lagu ku kau irama terindah <eos> tak lagi ku dengari <eos> kau pergi <eos> pergi ku cuba redakan relung hati <eos> bayangmu yang berlalu pergi <eos> terlukis di dalam kenangan <eos> bebas bermain di hatiku <eos> cerita tentang masa lalu <eos> cerita tentang kau dan aku <eos> kini tinggal hanya kenangan <eos> kau abadi dalam hatiku <eos> harusnya takkan ku biarkan engkau pergi <eos> membuat ku terpuruk rasa ingin mati <eos> derita yang mendera kapan akan berakhir <eos> hanya engkau yang mampu taklukkan hatiku <eos> cerita tentang masa lalu <eos> cerita tentang kau dan aku <eos> kini tinggal hanya kenangan

<eos> side steps to a death defying feat <eos> wait for him to reappear <eos> look close youll see him sweat the most <eos> each time his options disappear <eos> just a shaking hand without a concrete

<eos> and i follow suit <eos> she fills my glass <eos> and i toss it back <eos> into the space that once held you <eos> and dance dance to the radio <eos> while the devil takes control <eos> theres a weight <eos> holdin me down <eos> martha says <eos> its all in my head <eos> i look at the lights <eos> dancing in her eyes <eos> and i wanna die <eos> dancing in her eyes <eos> dance dance to the radio all my friends are drifters <eos> all my friends are lost <eos> lets get out of the city <eos> to the westcoast <eos> leave all our troubles <eos> lets find a new way <eos> nothing new on the horizon <eos> in this promised land <eos> oh all this time were wasting <eos> well never get it back <eos> searching for the answers <eos> along this dusty old track <eos> and those who came before us <eos> the rebels and the saints <eos> were just like a drizzle <eos> they were hurricanes <eos> oh love <eos> what will i become <eos> what could i have done <eos> we are wanderers by trade <eos> were like mockingbirds were fake <eos> we are selfulfilling prophecies <eos> born to walk the earth without a cause <eos> we are who we say we are <eos> raise your glass for freedom <eos> raise your glass for fun <eos> we are sons and daughters of <eos> the children of the sun <eos> and if theres yet a battle <eos> a battle to be won <eos> we sit back and listen <eos> while the government roars <eos> oh love <eos> what will i become <eos> what could i have done <eos> we are wanderers by trade <eos> were like mockingbirds were fake <eos> we are selfulfilling prophecies <eos> born to walk the earth without a cause <eos> we are who we say we are <eos> better rise up <eos> turn the lights on <eos> find a rock <eos> that doesnt roll <eos> sing a new song <eos> for the lost love <eos> just remember <eos> you reap what you sow came out of mourning washed the violet from her mane <eos> was it an omen the horses circled on the plain <eos> we waited for the sky to drop <eos> oh as we called upon the name <eos> we didnt want the storm to stop <eos> we wanted everything to change <eos> oh how we hope you know <eos> that we do the best we can do the best we can <eos> we never knew that you would notice <eos> if we had known it we could have planned for the rain <eos> do the best we can do the best we can <eos> our wells had faltered the fruit it died upon the vine <eos> misplaced the farmer poured forth the bitter wine <eos> the age is moving in and out <eos> washing the eighties from the earth <eos> beyond the shadow of the drought <eos> beyond the shadow of the drought <eos> oh how we hope you know <eos> that we do the best we can do the best we can <eos> we never knew that you would notice <eos> if we had known it we could have planned for the rain <eos> do the best we can do the best we can i woke up at am <eos> my eyes were closed but my mind was awake <eos> pretended i was breathing in a deep sleep pace <eos> got dressed so quietly <eos> i was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door <eos> as i got outside i smiled to the dog <eos> i didnt wanna wake you up <eos> my love was never gonna be enough <eos> so i took my things and got out of your way now girl <eos> why didnt you wake me up <eos> im pretty sure i would have told you to stop <eos> lets try again and say goodbye <eos> goodbye to yesterday <eos> why would you think like that <eos> yeah we fight a lot but in the end <eos> you and i were a perfect match <eos> i wouldnt want it any other way <eos> but now youre gone and im all alone <eos> lying here naked and staring at the phone <eos> i didnt wanna wake you up <eos> my love was never gonna be enough <eos> so i took my things and got out of your way now girl <eos> why didnt you wake me up <eos> im pretty sure i would have told you to stop <eos> lets try again and say goodbye <eos> goodbye to yesterday <eos> i didnt wanna wake you up <eos> my love was never gonna be enough <eos> so i took my things and got out of your way now girl <eos> why didnt you wake me up <eos> im pretty sure i would have told you to stop <eos> lets try again and say goodbye <eos> goodbye to yesterday <eos> goodbye to yesterday <eos> goodbye to yesterday i get no kick from champagne <eos> mere alcohol <eos> doesnt thrill me at all <eos> so tell me why should it be true <eos> that i get a kick out of you <eos> some get a kick from cocaine <eos> im sure that if <eos> i took even one sniff <eos> it would bore me terrificallytoo <eos> yet i get a kick out of you <eos> i get a kick every time i see you <eos> standing there before me <eos> i get a kick though its clear to see <eos> you obviously dont adore me <eos> some get a kick in a plane <eos> flying too high <eos> with some gal in the sky <eos> is my idea of nothing to do <eos> but i get a kick out of you <eos> i get a kick out of you these ravines were here before us <eos> so make your case from on your patio <eos> well be thorough in ignoring it all <eos> and it makes no difference what you say <eos> cause we never listen and were sure to be <eos> safe as always from your patio calls <eos> and its ours to explore how we want to explore <eos> theres a reason were out here <eos> but you have no use <eos> so go back to wherever you came from before <eos> and remember your manners cause someday were sure to be <eos> ashes ashes everyone and whatevers left is <eos> better off in the world without us <eos> here to squander it all <eos> so it makes no difference what you say to us <eos> we dont even take you serious <eos> safe as always from your patio calls <eos> and its ours to relate how we want to relate <eos> theres a reason were in it <eos> but you have no use <eos> so go back to whatever <eos> you were doing before you decided to speak <eos> and remember your manners or well overshadow you all im over it im over it im over it uh huh <eos> im over it im over it im over it uh huh <eos> even in my apartment <eos> with the noise of the freeway <eos> and i feel so separate <eos> yet i feel no shame <eos> im over it im over it im over it uh huh <eos> im over it im over it im over it uh huh <eos> and all they tell me is progress <eos> i dont want any part of <eos> and i feel no remorse <eos> no i feel no shame <eos> found it and its all <eos> just as we thought it should be <eos> waited up forever <eos> or what seemed like it to me <eos> and i have and i have no remorse no remorse <eos> for the way that i am anymore <eos> no i feel no i feel feel no shame feel no shame <eos> if you want you could just look away <eos> and i have and i have no remorse no remorse <eos> for the way that i am anymore <eos> no i feel no i feel feel no shame feel no shame <eos> if you want you can just look away <eos> and i have and i have no remorse no remorse <eos> for the way that i am anymore <eos> no i feel no i feel feel no shame feel no shame <eos> if you want you can just look away all i wanna say are the only words with any meaning yeah <eos> and i feel that way even though theres some who feel nothing at all <eos> but were not like that and you know and you know we got our reasons yeah <eos> never been like that cause there aint no safety where they sink and so <eos> all i wanna say are the only words with any meaning yeah <eos> and i feel that way even though theres some who feel nothing at all <eos> but were not like that and you know and you know we got our reasons yeah <eos> never been like that cause there aint no safety where they sink and so <eos> dont let em shake you up so easy no <eos> theyll never shake us off so easy oh <eos> all i wanna say are the only words with any meaning yeah <eos> and ill be that way till the light goes <eos> light goes light goes <eos> so familiar with the abstract <eos> ever out of reach and the pattern of it all <eos> from the colors and the castouts to the unknown <eos> i could never turn it off <eos> i kept up with the verses in my head <eos> running right along beside em all day <eos> at some point well i found myself wondering <eos> if i was even running or just <eos> running away <eos> i wanna live an honest life <eos> wanna make myself right for whatevers gonna come <eos> i see no purpose in avoiding the struggle inside <eos> like it isnt going on <eos> some say that youre probably better off <eos> so ignore it anytime that you can <eos> but how it is wed be better off for it <eos> really i dont understand i wont ever understand <eos> they dont speak they dont speak for me no <eos> they dont speak they dont speak for me no <eos> they dont speak they dont speak for me no

<eos> they dont speak they dont dont they dont dont through the flurry i saw trouble come <eos> then the smoke that rose like signals <eos> telling me something was off <eos> you can wait around however <eos> long it takes to see so for yourself <eos> or gather what you want and come along <eos> cause a pause is the only time it takes <eos> for them to get a jump on us woah <eos> so if youre staying in youd best be braced <eos> but if youre coming out then lets just go <eos> but i can see an opening from here <eos> and the the sound of so many voices <eos> making the rest disappear <eos> cause everything that came before this serves no purpose <eos> lets get one thing straight <eos> our past is in the ashes are we clear <eos> cause where we were there was no cause woah <eos> worthy of a sacrifice woah <eos> i tell you that theres still hope now yeah <eos> but it was never there so here we go woah woah woah <eos> woah woah woah woah <eos> woah woah woah woah <eos> woah woah woah woah <eos> free from the undertow <eos> i aint ever gonna go down <eos> free from the undertow <eos> i aint ever gonna go down <eos> free from the undertow <eos> i aint ever gonna go down <eos> free from the undertow <eos> i aint ever gonna go down far off from that shady past <eos> ascending up those stairs <eos> i finally heard a voice of reason <eos> i had not heard in years <eos> despite your efforts to convince me <eos> that there wasnt nothing there <eos> i finally faced my intuition <eos> after all <eos> but i remember waking up <eos> and walking through that snow with you <eos> my mind was almost static <eos> in all that winter cold <eos> and for the sake of preservation <eos> well i decided not to notice <eos> that my interests played no part <eos> in your design <eos> were not so different you and i <eos> you got your reasons for avoiding your demons <eos> and i know i got mine <eos> so watch out for those predators <eos> they got fear inside their hearts <eos> theyre sure to strike you from a distance <eos> and tear your flesh apart <eos> and then get angry <eos> cause youre tracking all your blood across their floor <eos> well we dont need those contradictions <eos> anymore <eos> were not so different you and i <eos> you got your reasons for avoiding your demons <eos> and i know i got mine <eos> were not so different you and i <eos> were not so different you and i <eos> were not so different you and i <eos> you got your reasons for avoiding your demons <eos> and i know i got you got your big idea <eos> i got my big idea <eos> and anyone who wanna stay can stay <eos> if they can find a reason <eos> your line around the corner <eos> my line is turning over <eos> and i dont need to see the light of day <eos> to feel it on my shoulder <eos> all of my ins are on the outside <eos> and i want you all to notice <eos> cause i have no will to hide <eos> with only dark around me <eos> so cold i couldnt ever <eos> manage to see the curtains draw their weight <eos> around me like a sweater <eos> and hold all my memories of shelter <eos> beside me like a furnace <eos> either way i choose to turn <eos> and leave me out so long i doubt im ever gonna be <eos> so picked apart and practiced at the art of never changing <eos> and its all so much the weight the words to resonate <eos> i finally have i finally have alright already <eos> so much for the rest <eos> and hold all my memories of shelter <eos> beside me like a furnace <eos> either way i choose to turn <eos> and leave me out so long i doubt im ever gonna be <eos> so picked apart and practiced at the art of never changing <eos> and its all so much the weight the words to resonate <eos> i finally have i finally have alright already <eos> so much for so much for the rest in light of day we made a move through the rest <eos> all darkness air lost its will to deflect <eos> our fight was not so easily banned <eos> when things were getting old <eos> and when this happened i was weighed i was warned <eos> at the wounds i had sworn <eos> to never end up in there as it turns out now i guess that i was wrong <eos> and still i still i see more <eos> and in the following its been had its been hashed <eos> theyre lying still like some appeal in my past <eos> whatevers up it shows the take out the back <eos> my place was rugged all along <eos> but if you ever feel an urge to be friends <eos> or even notice any light thats to share <eos> i know you brought me round the way there instead <eos> and hoped for how it was before <eos> still i still i see more <eos> spit out your loses pile under buses <eos> maybe its ok maybe its ok <eos> spit out your loses pile under buses <eos> maybe youll decide maybe youll decide <eos> spit out your loses pile under buses <eos> maybe its ok maybe its ok <eos> spit out your loses pile under buses <eos> maybe youll decide maybe youll decide <eos> spit out your loses pile under buses <eos> maybe its ok maybe its ok <eos> ill be on your side the day i left <eos> my past behind me at the gate <eos> i ended up <eos> in such an unfamiliar place <eos> and what i saw of the mess they made <eos> so many lines not a word to say <eos> i couldnt turn it off so i had to turn away <eos> i never wanted <eos> that jilted version of the truth <eos> and everything they fought for <eos> they wanted me to fight for too <eos> so heres what i said to the ones i faced <eos> if youre coming in theres a price to pay <eos> so you can take it up but you cant take it away <eos> i see the whites of their eyes through the cracks of my <eos> fence and i wonder how long itll take <eos> for them to gather up whatever nerve they got <eos> well be the wall they hit lay them to waist <eos> i see the whites of their eyes through the cracks of my <eos> fence and i wonder how long itll take <eos> for them to gather up whatever nerve they got <eos> well be the wall they hit lay them to waist i see whites in the eyes of the lawless <eos> creeping in through the cracks of my fence <eos> i wanna shake em off im gonna pay em their dues <eos> cause after me theyre coming after you <eos> but i dont know if i can wait till then <eos> where im at im gonna be until the end <eos> and with a little unrest theyre sure to turn around and go <eos> cause they dont believe what they pretend to know <eos> and the ones who relate <eos> are the ones who will take it up <eos> i got a life in the breeze and the branches <eos> shake the leaves to make my presence known <eos> well its a curious path to be had by a few <eos> but its enough for me if its enough for you <eos> and the ones who relate <eos> are the ones who will take it up <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> come and lay your future in this earth and mud <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> leave it all behind and stay for good <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> come and lay your future in this earth and mud <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> leave it all behind and stay for good <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> come and lay your future in this earth and mud <eos> ante up wont you ante up <eos> leave it all behind and stay for good <eos> and the ones who relate <eos> are the ones who will take it up do the right thing do the right thing <eos> do it all the time do it all the time <eos> make yourself right never mind em <eos> dont you know youre not the only one

than this <eos> isnt it a danger you so much love to fight <eos> the world makes me impatient <eos> i wish i was pregnant with thunder and storm <eos> it all came in a moment my body exploded <eos> it all changed its form go ask the man from the wild <eos> with his heart upright as the spine <eos> say how is it pleasing to you to be seen <eos> in the rain and the wind <eos> the song was born as a boy <eos> and his hair came down full of gold <eos> they had a passion reserved <eos> but that day will never return since i met you my peace is gone <eos> all insanity coming down down down <eos> and you think that youll get over <eos> but it just goes on and on and <eos> since i met you mama my peace is gone <eos> since i met you been losing my hair <eos> all that was good now is laid to waste <eos> luck was always with me <eos> it just fell into my hands but <eos> since i met you mama im a broken man <eos> someday when my head gets clear <eos> ill lead you out of grace <eos> and pull you back in <eos> but till then cant see a thing <eos> youre always in my face <eos> till then its all im saying <eos> mama dont you goddamn get me down <eos> crying for relief and for crying out loud <eos> do you think you can forget it <eos> well you just dont understand that <eos> since i met you mama got a working plan out of the dawn i made a blueprint <eos> drawing it down from among the stars <eos> i gave permission to the floodlight <eos> but i wasnt really the one in charge <eos> when the air cleared i saw it moving <eos> moving with massive grace and speed <eos> i was alone in some extraordinary state of mind <eos> and then it went off <eos> skin like a cloud but touches me <eos> like the sun like the son of god <eos> i am inside and out <eos> shes the lady of the millions <eos> shes the queen of sound <eos> shes the laser from the sky cutting through me <eos> i took the paper they had made him <eos> reading out every secret thought <eos> that trouble is always out there waiting <eos> falling is always possible <eos> skin like a cloud but touches me <eos> like the sun like the son of god <eos> i am inside and out <eos> shes the lady of the millions <eos> shes the queen of sound <eos> shes the laser from the sky cutting through me its a story that dances like a happy girl <eos> in the blood of my family <eos> and he was sad because he saw a perfect thing <eos> and his soul wasnt old enough so he lost it <eos> like footprints in the shifting sand <eos> our days are scattered and brought back <eos> love always gives you a funny hand <eos> when you wake up in the devils camp <eos> with a forest of arms gathered into one <eos> they pulled me out of the water <eos> from the long embrace of the crystal sea <eos> and we ran till the evening <eos> like footprints in the shifting sand <eos> our days are scattered and brought back <eos> love always gives you a funny hand <eos> when you wake up in the devils camp <eos> we are your longest love <eos> it floats on a silver string from a to b <eos> when you found out how pretty we think you are <eos> something burst like a star inside your heart no more pills to get over the day if im out of my mind then feel oh and i sing hahaha heyheyhey you dont know what youre doing to me doing to me <eos> make up to many places to stay if im trying to get through to you theres no way <eos> darling i dont get your tricks <eos> you have to believe i want you above the others <eos> honey should i be holy or something weve got a shotgun <eos> no kicks and no fun was without love when a stranger came into sight <eos> beautiful and cruel like the desert night <eos> i wanted him so bad i picked my biggest fight <eos> at dawn he hit me on the hips <eos> and he hit me right was without love when a stranger fell on my heart <eos> struck down at the foot of the ladder of a god i wanted him so bad i dragged him down in the dark at dawn he hit me on the hips and he hit me hard many times ive seen the sun come up to give the mountain a fiery head but i aint seen nothing in my life like that morning when we lay there and he said for you have fought with men and god and you have always won mary ruth is mine <eos> lovely as i love her <eos> she would never hide <eos> herself with another <eos> and i lost myself in the drying winter cold <eos> dont know a thing about life but i am in love with your soul <eos> mary ruth my light <eos> kicking as i stole her <eos> there behind the shed <eos> i made her body older <eos> there had been a storm <eos> rolling from the mountain <eos> now that her back was worn <eos> everything came down <eos> she said i lost myself in the drying winter cold <eos> dont know a thing about life but im in love with your soul <eos> oh my darling wait <eos> wait for me to throw out <eos> all my sails or brakes <eos> till the summer she said oh delilah make not too much haste <eos> let me wait for death i already taste <eos> and id break free where i not tangled in the lace <eos> and the rose round you hips <eos> and its not the horses or the armies that kill me <eos> but its one lie from your lips <eos> oh delilah love jealous as the grave <eos> my heart you rend and my head you shave <eos> in sight of you i do not even have the strength <eos> to bite your arm when it grips <eos> and its not the horses or the armies that kill me <eos> but its one lie from your lips baby waiting the enemy sleeping at his feet <eos> such a sad thing to see wires in the trees <eos> darling sometimes i dont have a thing for you to keep <eos> i must hide away until im strong enough to leave <eos> im so terrified i think the angels waiting at my door <eos> ha has got a gun i have never seen before <eos> when he comes in i will have to fall unto the floor <eos> its been like this every night since i first heard his roar <eos> i saw fire over the forbidden mountain <eos> now i cannot live like i have lived before <eos> i saw honey dripping from the singing fingers <eos> now forever i will be singing so <eos> so are you a body in the darkness of the earth <eos> were there any kindnesses to help you at the birth <eos> if images are second he must be the third <eos> if your word returns to you it must have been heard <eos> i saw fire over the forbidden mountain <eos> now i cannot live like i have lived before <eos> i saw honey dripping from the singing fingers <eos> now forever i will be singing so <eos> i hear the sound from across the sea <eos> i hear the cry from beyond the hill <eos> is it also inside me <eos> i hear the noise from the battlefield <eos> i hear the song from the foreign ship <eos> is it the last thing i will hear <eos> and as ride the back of the beast <eos> life and death are equal to me <eos> hear the spirits hear them roar <eos> as they assemble at the door there your brilliant mind was stunning me again again <eos> alien and alive was every word you said you said <eos> i went down to the edge of the river <eos> i went up to the foot of the tower <eos> what a sign to see him in love <eos> what a deed that i didnt do <eos> what a lung it glows in the dark <eos> what a skin no one sees through <eos> higher than my arms two birds are fighting in the sky <eos> i am the king of dogs my money dies in a royal lie <eos> i went down to the edge of the river <eos> i went up to the foot of the tower <eos> what a sign to see him in love <eos> what a deed that i didnt do <eos> what a lung it glows in the dark <eos> what a skin no one sees through <eos> this is for the boy on the magic horse who owns my heart <eos> he has got golden hair and wears a robe of snow <eos> riding over clouds his face a lame his tongue a sword <eos> i have given him a name it means annas lord this is the dark that disappeared <eos> when you walked into the room of my mind <eos> this is the black ive been coughing up <eos> since i dived down to the lowest part <eos> you woke the monsters in the sea <eos> now theyre coming after me <eos> so lover bring them to the shore <eos> and we will listen as they soar <eos> oh holy day let it leave <eos> put a message on the wind <eos> i never wanted you to bleed <eos> but theres a devil inside me <eos> this is your body is your house <eos> this is bones are scaffolds that we borrow <eos> and our days so sober over over <eos> the most expensive road to follow <eos> you woke the monsters in the sea <eos> now theyre coming after me <eos> so lover bring them to the shore <eos> and we will listen as they soar <eos> oh holy day let it leave <eos> put a message on the wind <eos> i never wanted you to bleed <eos> but theres a devil inside me <eos> oh holy day let it breathe <eos> cut a message on the tree <eos> my hope was almost gone from me <eos> and some things dont leave easily in the morning you built her body <eos> like a shell in the sea with deadly sharks <eos> in the morning her many faces <eos> her electrical fire eyes were made <eos> if youd please play with princes with me in the <eos> city park <eos> in the city is it easy in your city heart <eos> i made a knot behind her head <eos> into her shiny silent hair <eos> if she were a siren id be dead <eos> lying in arms of gold and red <eos> and the drums are a living being <eos> called to cause the mind to swell and grow <eos> and if everyones in love with you <eos> can my love be something you dont know was it like a vision <eos> was it like the sky upon the waterline <eos> i had nothing for this <eos> i had not a single thing to know about <eos> and mary full of grace <eos> full to the brim <eos> mingling your fever with the ghosts <eos> of all that you miss <eos> ive lost every image outside of this <eos> i love her in the spaceship <eos> i love her in the slaughterhouse among the beasts <eos> silence would be wasted <eos> were it not like summer lying on her lips <eos> and mary full of grace <eos> full to the brim <eos> mingling your fever with the ghosts <eos> of all that you miss <eos> ive lost every image outside of this there is a tree to touch with relentless force <eos> whoever would trespass his heart into <eos> the holy folds <eos> met yahweh on a hill <eos> met yahweh on a hill <eos> there is a banner to be raised standing in my magnetic fields to await <eos> a rod of iron to strike the nations <eos> he will know me by the birds and bread <eos> of elijah laid in the riverbed <eos> of elijah laid in the riverbed <eos> the chariots of the hearth are his alone <eos> so we leave our households behind to meet <eos> weeping in the room filled with one enormous seam <eos> and the loudest voice <eos> the dream of your heart oh god <eos> the dream of your heart oh god <eos> it must have been just a moment up in the morning <eos> turn into something alive a universal eye that <eos> suddenly saw the blood <eos> suddenly saw the blood <eos> living beyond the flesh and bones <eos> of a collective surge who wanted to speed <eos> the day of wrath of consecration <eos> will it be enough to see at all <eos> when the light appearing is terrible <eos> when the light appearing is terrible <eos> till then it can only be found in native roars <eos> or within a million hearts and in sweetness in the air <eos> by the burning of the bodies across the desert <eos> the dream of your heart oh god <eos> the dream of your heart oh god set a fire set my heart <eos> hit me like alarm <eos> when they love their slow love <eos> it hits me so hard <eos> i fell upon a rocket <eos> high on its side <eos> we had already cried <eos> enough enough <eos> listen angel to the still <eos> slow words we say <eos> my birds flies <eos> she blinds my eyes <eos> but i cant look away <eos> i fell upon a rocket <eos> high on its side <eos> we had already cried <eos> enough now its time to get up ever since you passed your bleeding thought on mine <eos> you said we would be together till we die <eos> i ask why would you still leave me behind <eos> and you told me you would watch me from the sky <eos> oh you said you and me <eos> we stay up every night <eos> laugh until the morning <eos> i give away my heart <eos> as if i could afford it <eos> dont ever leave me <eos> dont ever leave me <eos> dont ever leave me <eos> dont ever leave me <eos> so you went away and it was so unkind <eos> crying aint no way for a girl to spend her time <eos> sometimes i still feel i would loose my time <eos> but then i think of how you ask me to try <eos> oh you said you and me <eos> we stay up every night <eos> laugh until the morning <eos> i give away my heart <eos> as if i could afford it <eos> dont ever leave me <eos> dont ever leave me im not here for the talking toy no <eos> the lovesick girl and the jealous boy no <eos> im just working on my own surface <eos> dont you too just want a piece <eos> that you can call yours <eos> im just working on my own surface <eos> dont you too just want a piace that you can call yours <eos> dont care for daisies dont care for roses <eos> go put your good sword where your own throat is <eos> or so <eos> holding it down till its cold <eos> i have a name for it lord <eos> if they think theyve wept like my soul <eos> they aint seen the girl on my road <eos> while were spinnning on shiny surface <eos> i think of you as they dance in circles <eos> with tears and stories to make it holy <eos> we think of money of love death glory <eos> or so <eos> holding it down till its cold <eos> i have a name for it lord <eos> if they think theyve wept like my soul <eos> they aint seen the girl on my road this is the air i breath <eos> this is the light i see <eos> this is the heart underneath <eos> in the pounding rain <eos> and this is the fumbling graphs <eos> this is a hollow love <eos> this is a sleepless night <eos> in a deep sheet green <eos> so give me a reason to sing <eos> wont you give me a reason to sing <eos> and please just help me now <eos> give me a job to keep <eos> and give me a place to sleep <eos> in a home i can call me own <eos> that the bank cant take <eos> so give me a reason to sing <eos> wont you give me a reason to sing <eos> and please just help me now <eos> in air borderlines they come to me <eos> and loads of little borders kiss <eos> i shout and scream to put me back to hold you again <eos> so carry a heart for me <eos> turn on a light to say <eos> for all of the hurt theyre be there next to you <eos> and scrabbling the dirt sing yourself to sleep <eos> because i dont know your name <eos> to the ocean we will go <eos> if the land wont stop us first <eos> so kiss yourself for life <eos> from the threats you cant bend <eos> oh of all the things we have done <eos> it doesnt seem good enough <eos> so we sing at the source that we love <eos> we were young and we dont know your name <eos> do you ever sit and stare <eos> the quickening of time <eos> is there something else for us <eos> or a line well never cross tell me any lie that you want <eos> its more than i know <eos> you said the words yourself <eos> tell me any lie that you want <eos> and i will follow <eos> the clock to stop the blood <eos> in shoot our hearts <eos> woe upon the ones we love <eos> and to those our hearts are wound <eos> there a darkness rises up <eos> and we scream up blood <eos> think about the burning strands <eos> woah im on fire <eos> wrapped up in this flare <eos> for what its worth <eos> its tired and old <eos> to mark the ground <eos> we rape to own <eos> in shoot our hearts <eos> woe upon the ones we love <eos> and to those our hearts are wound <eos> there a darkness rises up <eos> and we scream up blood <eos> and were all trying to <eos> not shoot up the strains <eos> and were all trying to <eos> not shoot up the strains <eos> so lie upon the ones you love <eos> and to those you do your worst <eos> pull the flags up off your door <eos> and rinse the blood youre soaking with <eos> and i am bored as hell <eos> youre not alone <eos> youre not alone <eos> so drink away your fears <eos> acknowledge them <eos> and you only with them breathe <eos> youre not alone <eos> youre not alone <eos> so teach the widow wife <eos> and hope its selflessness wont turn to smile <eos> hope youre not alone <eos> youre not alone <eos> you never calm me down <eos> i want to feel my heart is bursting out <eos> sing im not alone <eos> im not alone <eos> im not alone <eos> im not alone <eos> and afterwords you seem to smile <eos> and bury you in the sand <eos> and words that make each moment come <eos> and bring on with the past <eos> and words you found in the cracks of the wall <eos> in the open of your <eos> hands <eos> carries the message of our life <eos> carries the message of our hope <eos> carries the message of our loved <eos> carries the message of our dears take me up my only love <eos> for my body is tired <eos> i want a night to feel cool <eos> against a skin which is bruised <eos> and my heavy heart to rise <eos> speak to me my only love <eos> because i cant be alone <eos> oh i need you to talk about <eos> your days passing thoughts <eos> pretend that were still young <eos> well we are we are not gone <eos> sing to me the leaving song <eos> because im not coming back <eos> oh the ghosts in this town <eos> are dragging us down <eos> and i want to feel alive <eos> i want to feel alive <eos> so wont you save me tonight <eos> from this world and its own fire <eos> you know my heart and my soul are bursting with desire <eos> so burn all our sea and all the dreams the scent of <eos> our fears to admire underneath <eos> so wont you leave with me in body and soul <eos> anywhere that we dont know <eos> anywhere that please wont break my heart <eos> and anywhere that we might breathe <eos> and anywhere that they cant see <eos> and anywhere that please wont break my heart <eos> and anywhere that we can rest <eos> and have our thoughts in the sunset <eos> and anywhere that please wont break my heart you picked me up in the morning light <eos> with a heavy head and sallow eyes <eos> a ball of flesh and heavy bone <eos> known better days are kind of sore <eos> i used to dream of leaving here <eos> now i just sleep away the fear <eos> nothing much ever came from me <eos> a sack of empty promises <eos> and if all these selfish thoughts <eos> would please just stop <eos> sometimes do you wish you could watch it burn <eos> the life youve built and the things you own <eos> and i dreamt of her again last night <eos> and how i could put the past to right <eos> and if all these selfish thoughts <eos> would all just stop <eos> and leave a little room for <eos> someone else <eos> when all that it would help <eos> to fall behind <eos> i used to dream of leaving here <eos> but the roots that bind were mine to grow please lay me down lay me down <eos> lay me down dont ever go <eos> before these songs <eos> before these songs <eos> before these songs <eos> its all fading away <eos> sing me a note that i might know with all my aching heart <eos> send me the dirt that i might hold so i know where to start <eos> send me a vibe for im the rich <eos> send me a vibe for im the rich <eos>

this hill top <eos> i buried you <eos> as a younger man <eos> we gathered round <eos> your empty husk <eos> and spoke of how you were so loved <eos> and as the sun died <eos> i promised that id seek you out <eos> well now the years have weathered me <eos> and soon ill claim you for my arms again <eos> and if our hearts all disappear <eos> and if our bones they crumble to the soil <eos> well all our love will rise again <eos> and if our hearts all disappear <eos> and if our bones they crumble to the soil <eos> and all our love will rise again <eos> and well float to the sea darling can you hear me can you open up your eyes <eos> and see that every move i make is a dance just for your gaze <eos> that every single action is a means not to an end <eos> an opposite reaction to the diffidence we claim <eos> so paint me take me hate me claim me make me something more <eos> something better than the black and white that coloured me before <eos> i want to feel your body and your hands upon my chest <eos> to feel my emptiness <eos> so bury me beneath the pines <eos> in the shallow soil <eos> in the filth and grime <eos> and still this heart will yearn for you <eos> so ive hatched upon a plan a scheme of dervish wit <eos> a pilot light to guide me through the caverns of your heart <eos> i take this knife upon myself and gouge a shallow track <eos> until you love me back so out of line with the stars and the sky <eos> with our feet wet with dew we will sing me and you <eos> with your hands on my chest say i loved you the best and kiss me kiss me <eos> take your hand from my hand close the door silently <eos> in an hour or so youll kiss your husbands lips <eos> in the fleeting remorse you know its the pain thats so good so kiss me <eos> and if you want me to lie then i will i dont mind <eos> cause you tell me <eos> jagged thorns cut my lips <eos> make them better make them bleed <eos> punch your fist in my chest and save your tears for someone good <eos> did you think this was love do you think youre the first then kiss me <eos> and if you want me to lie then i will i dont mind <eos> cause you tell me we tore my shirt just back from school <eos> and in an old beginning we found something new <eos> through a single slot the sun lit the rooom <eos> i watched it rise to youre eyes <eos> but you just slept right through <eos> and i knew then id do anything to never leave the room <eos> your spine leads my hands <eos> as i count the indentations <eos> oh you shake like bare arms on a street <eos> when puddles crack beneath our feet <eos> both reflecting our ideals and resolutions and our fears <eos> but in the haze i see you clear <eos> youre a rush of colour in a fifties film <eos> youre a prisoners hands on a moving train <eos> and im tied to you <eos> im tied to you <eos> im tied to you and there you stay <eos> as your boat was sold away <eos> sold as silver so they say <eos> its been a long time <eos> and in the rain <eos> ill keep your stories and your keys <eos> your songs of calm and raging seas <eos> make me feel ï¬ne <eos> take all my subtlety <eos> cause ive got nowhere else to be now darling <eos> take everything to sea <eos> cause weve got everything we need here darling <eos> your daughter <eos> gone with the water rise <eos> its easy to romanticise <eos> the other side <eos> take all my subtlety <eos> cause ive got nowhere else to be now darling <eos> take everything to sea <eos> cause weve got everything we need here darling <eos> its fall down south <eos> and that stays true <eos> but im no april fool for you we wish we wish <eos> and all we do is wait <eos> and we hope we hope <eos> but never do we pray <eos> cause we know <eos> theres not much to say <eos> we grow we grow <eos> but never do we change <eos> we mold we fold <eos> we always rearrange a dream <eos> when it is not a success <eos> its gotta be this one <eos> i know it is i know it is <eos> its this one <eos> i know it is i know it is <eos> its this one its you <eos> its gotta be this one <eos> i know it is i know it is <eos> its this one <eos> i know it is i know it is <eos> its this one its you <eos> now and then i think of what

and they will float again <eos> oh no we lost the words again <eos> oh no we lost the words again <eos> oh no we lost the words again <eos> oh no we lost the words again <eos> oh no we lost the words

burning like a fire <eos> on a dark street <eos> now fall a feet <eos> falls short of me <eos> and hes tearing after youth <eos> and fresh meat <eos> cause he needs because he needs <eos> because he needs <eos> and all you wintered well <eos> til vineyards bloom <eos> you come around much <eos> and you leave too soon <eos> theres no more worth in your red <eos> well your grace is gone <eos> before a fleeting flame <eos> your eyes are glazed and green <eos> are all i see <eos> and with your flight <eos> i felt denied <eos> return to me <eos> before a fleeting flame <eos> your eyes are glazed and green <eos> are all i see <eos> and with your flight <eos> i felt denied <eos> return to me <eos> ill swallow you <eos> like i couldnt do inside your head we go exploring <eos> and your eyes have seen better days <eos> once green now gray <eos> go on youll find <eos> me close behind <eos> and i know that youre near <eos> just because im here <eos> and all you have to do in life is die <eos> everything else is a choice <eos> and all weve got to do tonight is try <eos> to think over all the noise <eos> and i know i will never understand <eos> but i wish youd come back and ask for my hand <eos> cause id cut both them off <eos> to see your face <eos> and convince you that its all such a waste <eos> its all such a waste <eos> trees throw their leaves to the ground <eos> and some people live without sound <eos> to the man with a plan to take all he can <eos> remember trees throw their leaves to the ground <eos> trees throw their leaves to the ground <eos> and some people live without sound <eos> to the young little boy who lost all his toys <eos> at least youre no leaf for now x youve got your head and youre heart mixed up <eos> and theres nothing i could say and theres nothing i could do to prove you wrong <eos> youve got your head and your heart mixed up <eos> and i think that i knew and i think that ive known all along <eos> but you knew we had it coming you knew

ï¬ames they wont take <eos> but i thought you knew the lights running through <eos> so empty your head and open your eyes <eos> leave the dark in the dark so that our days can <eos> start with the sunrise <eos> leave the dark in the dark <eos> because we found ï¬rst hand the rules dont bend <eos> and when we tied our knots we left loose ends youve never seen your mother look younger than <eos> you <eos> i watched you change colour from the back of the <eos> room <eos> now youre blowing through the treetops <eos> and theres a weight on my back <eos> but its just another car crash <eos> just a fatal attack <eos> but its not your fault <eos> i was scared i still am <eos> i will still call like youre there <eos> and thats not your fault <eos> you know your brother youve shared his room

the dark <eos> and oh were terrified <eos> our curfews nights bloom <eos> until we clear the sky i tried to just believe i wouldnt fall on my knees <eos> but yet again i always fall for this kind of thing <eos> i tried to just believe it wouldnt end in defeat <eos> i never thought that i would be in this same place <eos> i always turn around and then its gone these days <eos> and after all of it

<eos> we slept like dogs down by the fire side <eos> awoke to the fog all around us <eos> the boom of summer time <eos> we stood <eos> steady as the stars in the woods <eos> so happyhearted <eos> and the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> as the old pine fell we sang <eos> just to bless the morning <eos> hot sand on toes cold sand in sleeping bags <eos> ive come to know the friends around you <eos> are all youll always have <eos> smoke in my lungs or the echoed stone <eos> careless and young free as the birds that fly <eos> with weightless souls now <eos> we stood <eos> steady as the stars in the woods <eos> so happyhearted <eos> and the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> we stood <eos> steady as the stars in the woods <eos> so happyhearted <eos> and the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> as the old pine fell we sang <eos> just to bless the morning <eos> we grow grow steady as the morning <eos> we grow grow older still <eos> we grow grow happy as a new dawn <eos> we grow grow older still <eos> we grow grow steady as the flowers <eos> we grow grow older still <eos> we grow grow happy as a new dawn <eos> we grow grow older still oh go far from this

door <eos> my strong hands to hold good friends that i never lost <eos> and what we found <eos> down these coves of limestone and cockle shells <eos> what we found <eos> down these roads that wander as lost as the heart <eos> is a chance to breathe again a chance for a fresh start to you <eos> my my a chance to breathe again a chance for a fresh start to you <eos> oh my a chance to breathe again a chance for a fresh start <eos> oh no see these waters theyll pull you up <eos> oh no if youre bolder than the darkness <eos> my my let these songs be an instrument to cut here darling <eos> these

here oh <eos> the white house on the hill <eos> and black clouds the weather <eos> and the church spire over the river <eos> she still sits there warmin the evening glow <eos> but you dont care about <eos> these scenes i treasure <eos> about these wore swimmers <eos> i know i know <eos> seems everything around here <eos> stays like stone <eos> seems its about time darling <eos> about time we let this all go <eos> cause everything will start again anew <eos> cause everything just goes away my friend <eos> and every king knows it to be true <eos> and every kingdom must one day come to an end <eos> and the sun vanished may be long gone <eos> and all these memories weve found <eos> but shell be here when its all done <eos> when our bodies laying beneath the ground <eos> she knows everything that goes around <eos> comes comes around here <eos> she knows everything that stays here somehow <eos> guess wed all begin black flies on the windowsill <eos> that we are <eos> that we are <eos> that we are to know <eos> winter stole summers thrill <eos> and the rivers cracked and cold <eos> see the sky is no mans land <eos> a darkened plume to stay <eos> hope here needs a humble hand <eos> not a fox found in your place <eos> no man is an island this i know <eos> but cant you see <eos> maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone <eos> black flies on the windowsill <eos> that we are <eos> that we are <eos> that we are to hold <eos> comfort came against my will <eos> and every story must grow old <eos> still ill be a traveler <eos> a gypsys reins to face <eos> but the road is wearier <eos> with that fool found in your place <eos> no man is an island this i know <eos> but cant you see <eos> maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone <eos> no man is an island this i know <eos> but cant you see <eos> maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone <eos> so here we are <eos> and i dont wanna beg your pardon <eos> and i dont wanna ask you why <eos> but if i was to go my own way <eos> would i have to pass you by <eos> and i dont wanna beg your pardon <eos> and i dont wanna ask you why <eos> but if i was to go my own way <eos> would i have to pass you by all i am is the

<eos> and i dont love you to make a point <eos> its the hollow of my heart that cries when i miss you <eos> and it keeps me alive when were apart the church went down and it didnt go gently <eos> the burning steeple fell right onto main street <eos> the old stained glass exploded <eos> pieces of jesus at my feet <eos> molten broken jesus at my feet <eos> what kind of god would let this be <eos> what kind of spirit or trinity <eos> what kind of god what kind of friend <eos> did god let jesus die again <eos> god let jesus die again <eos> in the name of faith and religion <eos> how much trouble must we witness <eos> all the wars hate and sickness <eos> cant somebodys god fix this <eos> cant any bodys god fix this <eos> what kind of god would stand by <eos> what kind of spirit or lord on high <eos> what kind of god what kind of friend <eos> did god let jesus die again <eos> god let jesus die again <eos> and it makes you wonder <eos> why bother to conceive of anything greater <eos> than just what you can see <eos> when all that you can see is <eos> the church went down and it didnt go gently <eos> the beloved steeple burned upon the tar <eos> and so goes faith falling <eos> breaking me open in my heart <eos> breaking me open in my heart <eos> what kind of god would let this go <eos> what kind of spirit or holy ghost <eos> what kind of god <eos> what kind of friend <eos> maybe god let jesus die <eos> cause we wouldnt get it otherwise <eos> in canyons and in purple skies <eos> thats how you get to the big reprise <eos> not like hes some guy <eos> sitting up there thinking this is why <eos> but maybe everything lets everything die <eos> to make us all the more alive <eos> to love one another and be really present <eos> right here right now <eos> maybe god lets me and you <eos> moses and mohammad too <eos> maybe god let jesus die again and again why didnt you tell me that the only reason <eos> why you walked away <eos> is you were afraid i might leave you <eos> and why didnt you tell me that the only reason <eos> for the things youd say <eos> is you were afraid i didnt need you <eos> and now that youve done everything you could <eos> to make me lose my faith in you <eos> you say "come on believe me" <eos> and now that youve done everything you could <eos> to make me lose my desire for you <eos> you say "please dont leave me" <eos> why didnt you tell me that the only people <eos> that you push that far <eos> are the ones that you really love <eos> and why the night we were talking <eos> and walking under the west side highway <eos> did you say "this would never ever be enough" <eos> and now that youve done everything you could <eos> to make me lose my faith in you <eos> you say "believe me" <eos> and now that youve done everything you could <eos> to make me lose my desire for you <eos> you say "please dont leave me" <eos> you try so hard to explain <eos> you try so hard to take the blame <eos> i dont mind what you say <eos> theres the line i cant

get some by <eos> you have said that you cannot breathe <eos> when youre caught up inside here with no reprieve <eos> i have been trying <eos> not to hold you to your lines <eos> but i feel you leaning <eos> out more all the time <eos> oh no good deals in these mine fields today <eos> it dont matter how i walk i could get blown away <eos> underneath the soil and the flowers <eos> i can hear a ticking down from years to hours <eos> forever is a word i leave on the shelf <eos> i dont want history to repeat itself <eos> so i take it night by night <eos> and i try not to hold you too tight <eos> i have been dancing <eos> up and down the words <eos> trying to find out why <eos> things are not the way they were <eos> oh no good deals in these mine fields today <eos> it dont matter how i walk i could get blown away <eos> underneath the soil and the flowers <eos> i can hear a ticking down from years to hours ive been getting down about all the runaround <eos> about all the pushing and the standing in line <eos> but like my friends say you gotta do it anyway <eos> and it just gets harder when you ask why <eos> and im tired from all the weight <eos> im tired of being strong <eos> so wont you come and stay <eos> and let me lay down in your arms <eos> down in your arms <eos> ive been getting up early ive been getting my coffee <eos> ive been getting in this car and driving all over town <eos> talking to myself while im taking of my seat belt <eos> some people dont know how to slow down <eos> and im tired from all the weight <eos> im tired of being strong <eos> so wont you come and stay <eos> and let me lay down in your arms <eos> down in your arms <eos> ive got a troubled a troubled mind <eos> and youve got a heart a heart so kind so kind <eos> so pack an overnight bag dont

<eos> spent the winter in la <eos> she can run faster than a river <eos> sometimes i still hear her say <eos> you can always be gone <eos> but you cant always make the ride go on and on <eos> you can always drive fast <eos> but you cant always make the long ride last <eos> she fell in love in colorado <eos> and drove out west to see the bay <eos> ill feel sorry for him tomorrow <eos> but hes a lucky man today <eos> she will always be gone <eos> but she wont always make the ride go on and on <eos> she will always drive fast <eos> but she wont always make the long ride last <eos> one day she showed up at my house <eos> she said "want to get away" <eos> want to go to indiana <eos> a lot of music there they say <eos> ive never been back since <eos> i bought a car and i called it home <eos> i still miss the diner on main street <eos> miss walking down the old post road <eos> you can always be gone <eos> but you cant always make the ride go on and on <eos> you can always drive fast <eos> but you cant always make the long ride last when my daddy lived here <eos> i never worried <eos> when my daddy lived here <eos> he read me stories <eos> and i never was afraid <eos> when the endings were scary <eos> cause my daddy would say <eos> "i will keep you safe" <eos> when the wolf comes to the house <eos> now my mother has a boyfriend <eos> she let him move in <eos> she let him tell her <eos> shes just a fool <eos> and i heard them fighting <eos> i heard him knock her down <eos> and i tried to read that night <eos> but i dont like it now <eos> cause when the wolf lives in your house <eos> you cant get him out <eos> when my mother tells me <eos> we are a family <eos> but i dont want to be <eos> i have a plan <eos> cause im waiting for a day <eos> when i am stronger <eos> and i will step in the way <eos> ill make him sorry <eos> when the wolf lives in your house <eos> you cant get him out <eos> when the wolf lives in your house <eos> you cant get him out <eos> i will get him out i knew that i loved you <eos> the first time you got into my car <eos> your cheeks were flushed <eos> and i felt a hush come over me in the dark <eos> i got us lost but at the next cross <eos> you said i dont care where we are <eos> im in the right car <eos> i drove us slow down a fast food strip <eos> and you turned the radio on <eos> i was confused all the signs were lit <eos> and you said i love this song <eos> i wanted to say that i loved you <eos> but i knew too soon too strong <eos> this is the ride im on <eos> this is the ride im on <eos> and i recall in my sleep <eos> how you changed my life on magnolia street <eos> a dream but its true <eos> i am not the same since i met you <eos> and i feel like im going home <eos> but not to the one ive known <eos> i knew that i loved you <eos> when we were flying home in the dark <eos> your hand on the wheel <eos> while i was trying to take my jacket off <eos> my foot on the gas your eyes fast <eos> to the road ahead of us <eos> i never felt such trust <eos> and i recall in my sleep <eos> how you changed my life on magnolia street <eos> a dream but its true <eos> i am not the same since i met you <eos> i knew that i loved you <eos> the first time you got into my car <eos> your cheeks were flushed <eos> and i felt a hush come over me in the dark <eos> you wake me up warm from sleep <eos> and you take me in your arms <eos> this is the ride im on <eos> this is the ride i want <eos> and i recall so complete <eos> how you changed my life on magnolia street <eos> a dream but its true <eos> i am not the same since i met you <eos> and i feel like im going home <eos> but not to the one ive known youre not afraid of the water <eos> youre not afraid to go in <eos> youre not afraid of going under <eos> but i dont know how to swim <eos> when the time was nearly come <eos> i remember i can <eos> run run <eos> you see a house across the water <eos> on the other side <eos> you want to go go together <eos> you want me by your side <eos> when the time has nearly come <eos> i remember i can <eos> run run <eos> from the water from the water run <eos> and i can tell you youre the only one <eos> in the glimmer of the sun <eos> and from the side i say ill meet you <eos> i cant follow you but i can <eos> run run <eos> run run run <eos> and i can tell you youre the only one <eos> i can tell you youre the only <eos> run run run <eos> run run run <eos> run run run <eos> run run run run run i had a bicycle named heaven and i painted it blue <eos> when i lived next to you <eos> you would come knocking every afternoon <eos> want to take it out spinning with you <eos> if heaven had only loved me the way that it loved you <eos> id have had freedom all around me like you do <eos> i always want what i cant have <eos> all i got is a photograph of you and heaven you <eos> i had problems with my chemistry problems with distraction <eos> when i lived next to you <eos> you would come and help me help me with my fractions <eos> show me things i thought i knew <eos> if heaven had only loved me the way that it loved you <eos> id have had freedom all around me like you do <eos> i always want what i cant have <eos> all i got a couple laughs with you and heaven you <eos> i remember you every first day of the spring <eos> when the bicycles in bloom <eos> everybody is out i can see you riding <eos> back and forth between the sun and the moon <eos> if heaven had only loved me the way that i loved you <eos> id have had freedom all around me i would have you <eos> i always want what i cant have <eos> all i got is a photograph of you and heaven you i woke up at oclock and i couldnt get back to sleep <eos> i kept myself from calling you by watching the tv <eos> but all the faces that i saw they just turned into this <eos> the gentle of your hands and the tender of your kiss <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with be yeah <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with me soulfully <eos> last night you found my house you rang the bell for me <eos> i didnt know you very well i didnt know what it would be <eos> but i felt so close to you in so little time <eos> and when you said good night i spilled my glass of wine <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with be yeah <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with me soulfully <eos> by the hour of am i felt like id been up all day <eos> i told myself to let you sleep and then i called you anyway <eos> i woke you up and heard your smile over the phone <eos> and i thought about you lying there alone <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with be yeah <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with me soulfully <eos> do me good <eos> do you think you could be with be yeah <eos> you would do me good <eos> do you think you could be with me soulfully hes got an old chair its got no seat <eos> cracked snow shoes and warped wooden skis <eos> hardcovered books pages all turned brown <eos> my dad has a reason for everything he keeps around <eos> so if you need something when times get hard <eos> you can probably find it in my dads yard <eos> and if you need hope if youre coming apart <eos> you can surely find it in my dads heart <eos> you never really know just what might be in store <eos> if you go in the barn and open boxes on the second floor <eos> cause underneath the paper crumpled up in balls <eos> you might find a gem or you might find nothing at all <eos> and thats the fun of it its that mystery <eos> in all these things bearing other peoples history <eos> you can look at this stuff wonder where its been <eos> you can pick it up and you can use it again <eos> so if you need something when times get hard <eos> you can probably find it in my dads yard <eos> and if you need hope if youre coming apart <eos> you can surely find it in my dads heart <eos> he can see the beauty beneath the dust and grime <eos> he can see potential where the rest of us are blind <eos> he will polish the gray until it shines clear blue <eos> and if you know my dad he wont give up on you <eos> so if you need something when times get hard <eos> you can probably find it in my dads yard <eos> and if you need love if youre coming apart <eos> you can surely find it in my dads heart the city called me so i came <eos> it isnt mine to question what it said <eos> i sleep until the point when im awake <eos> i walk until theres nothing left to trek <eos> and everyone is looking for an answer <eos> and everyone is waiting for a break <eos> i came and i was bored of it soon after <eos> but i had nowhere to go and so i stayed <eos> i dreamed a lifetime of this place <eos> it seemed an awful thing to waste <eos> well the morning fills my mouth up with decay <eos> i like it it reminds me how you taste <eos> sometimes i feel you rising up behind me like the wind <eos> but i still try to look away <eos> what will you look like when youre old <eos> what will you look like when youre old <eos> what will i do if i dont know you <eos> what will i do if i dont know you <eos> i guess that i decided not to ask the day i took the road <eos> down to the city as it called <eos> sun making silhouettes of gauze <eos> i dont remember you at all <eos> the city called me and i came <eos> it isnt mine to question why <eos> sometimes the clouds will rise ahead i hear your name <eos> its like a choir in the sky <eos> what will you look like when youre old <eos> what will you look like when youre old <eos> what will i do if i dont know you <eos> what will i do if i dont know you <eos> i guess that i decided not to know the day i took the road <eos> down to the city as it called <eos> sun making silhouettes of gauze <eos> i dont remember you at all <eos> they pulled a human from my waist <eos> it had your mouth it had your face <eos> i would have kept it if id stayed i pray for rain because im trying <eos> to find god and make him cry <eos> because im dying in a fire beneath my covers <eos> and somewhere out across the way <eos> you ask for salt across a plate <eos> and you cant find a word to say <eos> to your own brother <eos> and you could call me over now <eos> and we could fix this with our mouths <eos> but you dont buy the farm <eos> if you cant afford the cow <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment <eos> that you dont want to share <eos> and you say you looked back in anger <eos> and it rose to meet your stare <eos> and you say i am not the one <eos> who puts the bullet to your gun <eos> and makes it flare <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment to you <eos> and you dont want to share <eos> you say youre looking for the truth <eos> like you got rifles in your books <eos> but up above your parents roof <eos> i saw no star tonight <eos> only the black from whence you came <eos> and where theyll send you back again <eos> and no blue plaque will keep your name <eos> from falling out of sight <eos> and you can wage this war of one <eos> and i am still the only one <eos> who will remember you when you are gone <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment <eos> that you dont want to share <eos> and you say you looked back in anger <eos> and it rose to meet your stare <eos> and you say i am not the one <eos> who puts the bullet to your gun <eos> and makes it flare <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment to you <eos> and you dont want to share <eos> oh and all the things you talk about <eos> but never say to me <eos> and all the things to talk about <eos> that i could say to you <eos> like reading an italian book <eos> from the thirteenth century <eos> is not that hard to do <eos> and i am not the kind <eos> who puts their toe against the line <eos> and makes it tear but this could be the thing <eos> that puts the blood into your skin <eos> and keeps it there <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment <eos> that no one else will ever understand <eos> and you say dylan is a sentiment to you <eos> but you are only just a man gabriel this is the last <eos> chapter of our correspondence <eos> i hope that after time goes past <eos> you can remember me with fondness <eos> and think as i am thinking now <eos> of all the pages that have seen us <eos> laid out an ending in between us <eos> and we can walk them like the ground <eos> i know my fate i do not mean to fight <eos> but you tread softly on the ground tonight <eos> tread softly on the words you used to write <eos> oh gabriel i see you there <eos> that day i met you in the orchard <eos> and i was younger then i wore my hair <eos> in bows across my forehead <eos> soon they will twist it at the shoulder <eos> and fix the clasp against my neck <eos> and i do not think you would know her <eos> if you could see what they reflect <eos> ive seen my future in an evening dress <eos> all wrapped in tapestry and fur i guess <eos> remember me the way you knew me best <eos> oh gabriel i have kept <eos> everything you sent me <eos> everything you put to paper but <eos> its better to forget <eos> than fill your head with memories <eos> think that you will thank me later <eos> oh gabriel i wish that i <eos> could pick you up and fold you like a ribbon <eos> id keep you always and in secret <eos> in the pockets of my clothes <eos> but this is how i live my life <eos> with all the parts that i was given <eos> this is the heart that i was given <eos> and what youre given can be sold <eos> i see my future in an evening dress <eos> and ive been walking to her step to step <eos> remember the way you knew me best <eos> i know my fate i do not mean to fight <eos> but you tread softly on the ground tonight <eos> tread softly on the words you used to write <eos> i know my fate i do not mean to fight <eos> but you tread softly on the ground tonight <eos> tread softly on the words you used to write when i first met you <eos> you said you would <eos> always love me <eos> if i would just be good <eos> i thought wed go through life <eos> your hand in mine <eos> but this house is empty now <eos> it must be christmas time <eos> i feel my love is dying <eos> outside the reindeer flying <eos> so i just watch them disappear <eos> dont call me christmas i dont love you anymore <eos> gave my whole life to you and what do i get <eos> im just so lonely <eos> go spread your happiness around the globe but you should know <eos> that i wont wait for you youll have to get a new <eos> mrs christmas <eos> you bring your presents <eos> around the world <eos> but what do you get up to <eos> with all those other girls <eos> tell them youll give them <eos> anything they wish <eos> and then you move on <eos> to someone elses list <eos> i was the first one to fall <eos> the one that you took north <eos> and now im stuck here on my own <eos> dont call me christmas i dont love you anymore <eos> gave my whole life to you and what do i get <eos> im just so lonely <eos> go spread your happiness around the globe but you should know <eos> that i wont wait for you youll have to get a new <eos> mrs christmas <eos> you promised me paradise <eos> but here i am in the snow and ice <eos> my heart froze many years ago <eos> another christmas eve alone <eos> dont call me christmas i dont love you anymore <eos> gave my whole life to you and what do i get <eos> im just so lonely <eos> go spread your happiness around the globe but you should know <eos> that i wont wait for you youll have to get a new <eos> mrs christmas is all that weve become <eos> just nothing but hats and bags <eos> were waiting for taxi cabs <eos> so you light cigarettes <eos> and im taking drags <eos> in the air a sea of words <eos> that didnt come soon enough <eos> in my mind a railway station <eos> and a ticket stub <eos> and it is easter in the town <eos> i can hear as they strike up the band <eos> were listening to some old man <eos> say he came back to life with a hole in his hand <eos> and now the sunday school is gathered <eos> together in pink and in blue <eos> theyre heralding angels for you <eos> but not for me <eos> theyre singing <eos> gloria in excelsis <eos> deo deo <eos> gloria in excelsis <eos> but theres no <eos> theres no hope <eos> and i am grateful for the things <eos> that youve tried to show to me dear <eos> but theres no arcadia <eos> no albi and theres no jerusalem here <eos> and underneath your pastures green <eos> theres earth and theres ash <eos> and theres bone <eos> and there are things that disappear <eos> into it and then they are gone <eos> and there is light that hits the sky <eos> and then it is midnight again <eos> and there is my mother my father <eos> and you and we are all impermanent <eos> and on the green they tell their tales <eos> about how even the dead can come back <eos> i just dont believe in that <eos> so you can keep on singing <eos> gloria in excelsis <eos> deo deo <eos> gloria in excelsis <eos> but theres no <eos> theres no hope <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing <eos> theres no such thing as ghosts once i was a flight risk <eos> slipping through the darkness <eos> but soon i think i will be safe <eos> out there in the distance <eos> you look like a north star <eos> oh somehow lead me to the next place <eos> oh oh oh when we let go <eos> of the shadows <eos> thats when im lost in you <eos> hold me close when we let go <eos> of the shadows <eos> let me get lost in you <eos> i wish i was a flight risk <eos> slipping through the darkness <eos> but now i i can see your face <eos> oh oh oh when we let go <eos> of the shadows <eos> thats when im lost in you <eos> hold me close when we let

electronic <eos> but i dont wanna go home <eos> so hold me close now the music is playing <eos> lean in i can hear what youre saying <eos> fill the meter i dont care if im paying <eos> i dont wanna go

take it slow like a heartbeat <eos> take it slow <eos> i lose control of my heartbeat <eos> take it slow <eos> take it slow like a heartbeat <eos> so i guess that youre the comedian <eos> cause you keep killing me <eos> what you do is killing me <eos> and i dont stop having these feelings <eos> youve got me saying "oh my god" <eos> with all the shit youre feeding me <eos> every day <eos> you make me weak like a heartbeat <eos> but you go too slow <eos> take it slow like a heartbeat <eos> take it slow <eos> take it slow like a heartbeat <eos> take it slow <eos> i lose control of my heartbeat <eos> take it slow <eos> take it slow like a heartbeat you are watching a programme for exactly an hour <eos> all of these hours they will add up to a day <eos> you will sit there till theyre done but there are <eos> to play <eos> therell be rims around your eyelids by the th or the <eos> th <eos> but if you go to sleep tonight you will be older when <eos> you wake <eos> and you say one man is the parachute and the other is <eos> the knife that cuts the brake <eos> first we were born then we ran slowly out of luck <eos> you are still not charles bukowski and i am not diane <eos> cluck <eos> and i would suck the life from you if there was any <eos> left to suck <eos> and i would love you if you told me there was something <eos> there to love <eos> i would marry you for money <eos> i would marry you for money <eos> i would marry you for money or for luck <eos> i would marry you for money but i dont suppose youll <eos> ever have enough <eos> well the man on the screen he has done more in a minute <eos> than you have achieved in your whole entire life <eos> when you finally realize i was the best thing you had <eos> in it <eos> well be closing up your eyelids on the bed or once you <eos> die <eos> and ill be sorry if it happens to you <eos> sorry if it happens to you <eos> sorry if it happens to you but <eos> i guess if one man is the cancer then his death is just <eos> the knife that makes the cut the birds were falling limbless from the sky <eos> falling in nobodys eyes but mine <eos> the birds were closing in again i try <eos> to fight them back and find my way outside <eos> squinting like a newborn in the light <eos> i walk for like an hour maybe five <eos> youre the only reason that i might find <eos> my way out here tonight <eos> i came here when the road was very dry <eos> the road was dry as paper so i typed <eos> and in the accident of hands producing lines <eos> i hope to clear the birds away and give them flight <eos> and when you clear the birds away you see the sky <eos> and when you see the sky you know which way to tread <eos> and i think youre the only reason <eos> that i might might might <eos> illuminate the text <eos> so i can see to where the grass is really bright bright bright <eos> meet you there and know which way to step <eos> oh my love youre always further than id like <eos> always moving just ahead of me like time <eos> and it isnt that i want to fall behind <eos> and it isnt that i dont know how to love <eos> but the world is made of paper so i type <eos> i write but i could never write enough <eos> now i can see to where the grass is really bright bright bright <eos> but i dont know if ill ever make it out <eos> and all the birds are falling limbless from the sky <eos> falling in nobodys eyes but mine <eos> and im squinting like a newborn in the light <eos> squinting like a newborn in the light <eos> of a paper forest starting to ignite <eos> of a paper forest burning out of sight <eos> and i think youre the only reason <eos> youre the reason youre the reason <eos> the reason for the fire <eos> oh oh no everythings moving so close <eos> im starting to lose my social halo <eos> i see

take whats mine <eos> no ive never lied <eos> just took some souvenirs <eos> keep your comic books <eos> remind me you were here <eos> when you lost <eos> a piece of me <eos> i know ill find in time

there is reason <eos> for my falling down <eos> see when youre gone <eos> im left with all this time to think about <eos> why i have this sudden urge to have to <eos> hit the ground <eos> i know its contradicting <eos> but lately ive been thinking <eos> your lack of shame is so amazing <eos> every time you leave me <eos> wondering if there is something <eos> wrong with me <eos> and if i could id take you with me <eos> and wed fall asleep <eos> yeah id do anything to have you <eos> laying next to me <eos> im pretty sure if i just keep my ear <eos> flat to the floor <eos> any minute now youll <eos> walk through my door <eos> and because i finally found <eos> what i was looking for <eos> ill never have to be alone anymore <eos> i hope you dont mind <eos> the broken pieces of my heart <eos> the pieces of my heart <eos> and i hope you dont think of me as <eos> pathetic when i want to cry <eos> when youre not here by my side <eos> and if i could id take you with me <eos> and wed fall asleep <eos> yeah id do anything to have you <eos> laying next to me <eos> your lack of shame is so amazing <eos> every time you leave me <eos> wondering if there is something <eos> wrong with me <eos> and if i could id take you with me <eos> and wed fall asleep <eos> yeah id do anything to have you <eos> laying next to me <eos> im pretty sure that there is reason <eos> for my falling down <eos> see when youre gone <eos> im left with all this time to think about <eos> why i have this sudden urge to have to <eos> hit the ground <eos> i know its contradicting <eos> but im so tired of thinking <eos> i hope you dont mind <eos> the broken pieces of my heart <eos> the pieces of my heart <eos> and i hope you dont think of me as <eos> pathetic when i want to cry <eos> when youre not here by my side <eos> and if i could id take you with me <eos> and wed fall asleep <eos> yeah id do anything to have you <eos> laying next to me oh i cant believe i cant believe <eos> that youd honestly pick me to call me your baby <eos> and if it isnt real isnt real <eos> then how do you explain all these things i feel <eos> for you <eos> and how all the little things you do make me <eos> and never could i describe how much you mean to me <eos> what if i could kiss the stars <eos> what if i could learn to love <eos> what if all these wishes made were to come true one day <eos> what if i just skipped a year <eos> learned to drive right out of here <eos> let go of everything and finally let my heart steer <eos> im holding onto the nothing that seems to hold onto me <eos> but its not right or wrong <eos> its all about what you believe <eos> and i believe i love you <eos> late at night when the whole town is dark <eos> i stare into the sky wondering where you are <eos> faces pass me as im walking by <eos> reminding me that youre not here so i sit here and cry <eos> for you <eos> and how i am torn from the absolute truth <eos> but its not a question for why i love you <eos> what if i could kiss the stars <eos> what if i could learn to love <eos> what if all these wishes made were to <eos> come true one day <eos> what if i just skipped a year <eos> learned to drive right out of here <eos> let go of everything and finally let my heart steer <eos> im holding onto the nothing that seems to hold onto me <eos> but its not right or wrong <eos> its all about what you believe <eos> and i believe i love you <eos> i believe i love you <eos> what if i just kissed the stars <eos> what if i have learned to love <eos> what if all these wishes made suddenly came today <eos> what if i just kissed the stars <eos> what if i have learned to love <eos> what if all these wishes made suddenly came today <eos> oh i cant believe <eos> that youd honestly pick me this bus has a way to make me feel safe <eos> at least from where i had stayed <eos> and as you sit with me <eos> i cant help but feeling that youll never go away <eos> the grass hides us both <eos> as we find ourselves running from <eos> a monstrous voice <eos> a routine accustomed <eos> because i am stuck with an old man <eos> that wont give up <eos> dear forrest <eos> i have been running along <eos> trying to find where i belong <eos> and it has been so long and <eos> i never did see until now that <eos> you were the only one for me <eos> and im more than sorry <eos> love jenny <eos> i dreamed of a life where id sing every night <eos> to crowds that would cheer my name <eos> but produce was thrown <eos> so you fought them all below <eos> and it left me just angry and pained <eos> so i held your hand like i always had planned <eos> as i told you i couldnt stay <eos> then the man in the truck told me to hurry up <eos> so with tears <eos> he took me away <eos> dear forrest <eos> i have been running along <eos> trying to find where i belong <eos> and it has been so long and <eos> i never did see until now that <eos> you were the only one for me <eos> and im more than sorry <eos> love jenny <eos> love

a hero <eos> so would you mind if i called you my own <eos> and never let you go <eos> wont you come to save me just once more <eos> just to prove to me <eos> youre the reason i stopped fighting for <eos> id like to think of you as someone like me <eos> but so much better <eos> its a little bit tough <eos> but i know im gonna reach it <eos> never gonna stop till im gonna get it <eos> dont let me

<eos> and lives to write poetry about <eos> love vs fight <eos> but i hope that youll be <eos> the one for me <eos> wont you watch these <eos> tivod episodes of lost with me <eos> we can spend all day discussing <eos> the theories <eos> oh i hope youre the one for me <eos> youre the artistic type <eos> i know that for sure <eos> you love the sound of the rain <eos> as much as you love the girls

youll be <eos> the one for me picking petals <eos> lyrics and music by aubrey wood <eos> tried picking petals off of daisies one by one <eos> collectively <eos> cause they might as well know better than me <eos> well surprise surprise <eos> i took a second guess as every one said <eos> yes <eos> but little did they know how he really felt inside <eos> or else those pretty little flowers just <eos> really knew how to lie <eos> to lie <eos> to lie <eos> if i sing you this song tonight <eos> will you recognize its for you <eos> as im singing this song tonight <eos> do you recognize its for you <eos> the sun was blazing through the velvet sky <eos> beneath i wondered why <eos> he wasnt there with me to pass the time <eos> well instead i had a couple flower friends <eos> beside me their old stems <eos> barren and sole <eos> im just like one of them <eos> on the ground wishing i could be <eos> full of life again <eos> again <eos> again <eos> if i sing you this song tonight <eos> will you recognize its for you <eos> as im singing this song tonight <eos> do you recognize its for you <eos> and for what youve put me through <eos> spent every day in the feverish <eos> heat of july <eos> seeking all the answers <eos> every bit of advice <eos> a petal at a time <eos> when id rather pay attention <eos> to a summer sunburn <eos> than to think about you and just <eos> how much it hurts <eos> to try and make it work <eos> now <eos> if i sing you this song tonight <eos> will you recognize its for you <eos> as im singing this song tonight <eos> do you even recognize that its for you <eos> and for what youve put me through <eos> what youve put me through <eos> just what youve put me through <eos> what youve put me through smile <eos> lyrics and music by aubrey wood <eos> burnt siennas creeping up <eos> from my toes up to my throat <eos> theyre telling me to shed my coat <eos> i said so long ever greens <eos> and laughing at the simple things i know <eos> here i go <eos> on and on like nothings wrong <eos> just watch me as i move along <eos> and <eos> smile <eos> let it stick <eos> at least for a little while <eos> oh i smile <eos> cause if i dont <eos> i might not make it home <eos> home <eos> got miles and miles <eos> left to go <eos> some day soon ill shed that coat <eos> i would hope <eos> from kanan back to mountain road <eos> warm sun or angels in the snow <eos> there they go <eos> temperatures at yet <eos> i have never felt so cold <eos> but i smile <eos> let it stick <eos> at least for a little while <eos> oh i smile <eos> cause if i dont <eos> i might not make it home <eos> maybe this is wrong <eos> maybe this wrong <eos> couldnt wait that long <eos> couldnt wait that long <eos> to keep my head up <eos> so i smile <eos> i smile <eos> let it stick <eos> at least for a little while <eos> oh i smile <eos> cause if i dont <eos> i might not make it home <eos> home island <eos> lyrics and music by aubrey wood <eos> i have learned that conformation <eos> is invisible <eos> cause it feels worse than it did <eos> before <eos> and now instead of having someones side <eos> to stand on <eos> i am stuck on my own island <eos> alone <eos> alone <eos> alone <eos> so whats to do <eos> when you cant prove the truth <eos> when all you have is the empty bed <eos> where you lie <eos> and loneliness will never tell you why <eos> what you did was right <eos> right <eos> is there a rule that you must lose <eos> before you get to some place good <eos> perhaps i should have kept my mouth shut <eos> i try so hard not to believe <eos> the person that you see in me <eos> but i dont know what else to think <eos> and shouldnt it feel better <eos> once youve done whats truly best <eos> well im unable to detect <eos> so whats to do <eos> when you cant prove the truth <eos> when all you have is the empty bed <eos> where you lie <eos> and loneliness will never tell you why <eos> what you did was right <eos> right <eos> evidence in context <eos> hiding in what i thought <eos> seemed better in my head <eos> and there i saw it spark <eos> in technicolor wonder <eos> sooner or later <eos> and you may never be sure when <eos> but i can only hope it will be <eos> worth it in the end <eos> getting away from love <eos> and a lifetime <eos> all that it took to get me to you <eos> im spending my days <eos> asleep on my island <eos> i cannot regret what i had <eos> to do <eos> to do <eos> so whats to do <eos> when you cant prove the truth <eos> when all you have is the empty bed <eos> where you lie <eos> and loneliness will never tell you why <eos> what you did was right <eos> right <eos> right complicate me all the time <eos> telling poetry from simple rhymes <eos> sometimes its just so hard to see whats right <eos> just like burning candles in the blinding light <eos> at times ill sit all by myself wondering what i havent tried <eos> but i cant help myself but try to lift my arms and fly <eos> i can feel it deep inside <eos> a voice within i never knew that i can call mine <eos> but if i fly theres a world thats yet to see <eos> well maybe if i fly ill find another part of me <eos> some say livings just a crazy ride <eos> but every coaster ive tried had me screaming for my life <eos> though i found that if i dont raise my hands high <eos> the wind cant pick me up so that i can fly <eos> i can feel it deep inside <eos> a voice within i never knew that i can call mine <eos> but if i fly theres a world thats yet to see <eos> well maybe if i fly ill find me <eos> cuz its just lights all bursting through the skyline <eos> and stars all waving me goodbye <eos> whispers haunting me forever <eos> but for all i can remember <eos> thought that you said i could never <eos> fly <eos> i can feel it deep inside <eos> a voice within i never knew that i can call mine <eos> and if i fly theres a world thats yet to see <eos> oh yeah well maybe if i fly ill find me if i fly <eos> i can feel it deep inside <eos> a voice within i never knew that i could call mine <eos> and if i fly theres a world thats yet to see <eos> well maybe if fly <eos> ill find me you dont remember your dreams <eos> they still make you strange <eos> the sun is a wheel <eos> the day is a cage <eos> your history is a bitch <eos> you got one good arm <eos> we aint gonna work <eos> on your <eos> you dont remember your dreams <eos> they still make you strange <eos> the sun is a wheel <eos> the day is a cage <eos> let them see your teeth <eos> every crooked charm <eos> as she float over reef <eos> and you turn into you have grown so much and now youre breaking <eos> every time youre laughing its like youre shaking <eos> something far outside of us connected <eos> but they dont see collision <eos> left me bruised and hoping <eos> so easy <eos> your tracks make no sound <eos> no matter what you see <eos> you have to get back to being found <eos> i felt alive like a convict out of becker <eos> free beneath the grays teeth <eos> flipping in the rainfall <eos> sometimes part of me wakes up collected <eos> forgetting whats expected of me <eos> i walk right through a bad seam <eos> so easy <eos> to turn the world down <eos> no matter what you dream <eos> you have to get back to being found <eos> thats deliriums way <eos> you know it seems so right <eos> all the entertainment they spray <eos> atrocities contrite <eos> it brings you back again <eos> it finds you every time <eos> the blackest quote they spit into the tin can of your mind <eos> its so easy <eos> to turn the world down <eos> no matter what you dream <eos> its so easy <eos> your tracks make no sound <eos> no matter what you see <eos> you have to get back to being found <eos> its always gonna blow your mind <eos> its always gonna blow your mind <eos> its always gonna blow her mind <eos> its always gonna blow your mind cheer up <eos> tune it out <eos> take your mask off <eos> have a shot <eos> are you a sick kid or a trick <eos> its gonna mess you up <eos> gone missing <eos> for a thrill <eos> kind of miss how it feels <eos> are you an angel or a flea <eos> get back <eos> its blinding <eos> kick it off <eos> shake the ground <eos> blow our brains up <eos> make it loud <eos> youll be so free <eos> but not enough for me <eos> stop with that soft scene <eos> that hip infection <eos> stop with that soft scene <eos> cheer up <eos> tune it out <eos> gone missing <eos> kind of miss how it feels <eos> are you an angel or a flea <eos> get back <eos> get back <eos> stop with that soft scene <eos> that hip infection <eos> stop with that soft scene <eos> we dont need you any more everyones interchangeable and were all just horror to the core <eos> open the door and look down the hillside these views are all you can afford <eos> i wanna feel a goodtime rave get off the street come down again <eos> its oh so sad to be happy all the time <eos> something like what the plants do in the wind behind your glass <eos> open the door and roll out to recess its strange to lose your class <eos> i wanna get their protocol get off your head come down the wall <eos> its oh so sad to be happy all the time <eos> its oh so sad to be happy all the time

dream a boy walks down a city road <eos> passed strangers and riverboats <eos> he boards a train to anywhere <eos> he leaves his mother and his home <eos> he left with pictures in his head <eos> memories enough to breathe life to the dead <eos> he asks me where i am going to <eos> but i dont even know where i have come from yet <eos> in the first degree above <eos> i am here for the escape <eos> swallows nest in other caves <eos> rested far away from all of us <eos> bruised and beaten in the fog <eos> throughout the forest fall the driftwood logs <eos> and i take rest upon the waterfall <eos> as the river flows slowly on <eos> i left with pictures in my head <eos> memories enough to breathe life to the dead <eos> i know exactly where im going to <eos> and how i want my life to end <eos> in the first degree above <eos> i am here for the escape <eos> swallows nest in other caves <eos> rested far away from all of us this ancient rock i sit upon has worn and weathered in the sun <eos> shadowed only by the land it has become <eos> theres fog across the mountainside still i am shrouded in the light <eos> theres nothing left in all the world from which to run <eos> i have been lost now for a little while <eos> the air is cold and time is far behind <eos> and ive been high now for a little while <eos> and now my eyes are open wider than they ever were <eos> i was stranded on a fishing boat abandoned in the storm <eos> solitude can lead your self out of the door <eos> we only live for seconds in the relativity of all <eos> yet the majority of our ideals are flawed <eos> i have been lost now for a little while <eos> i was troubled by the silence of the night <eos> and ive been high now for a little while <eos> and now im leaving all my past <eos> im driving forward with the wind beside me <eos> as masterplans <eos> fall into motion <eos> waves are breaking on the shoreline <eos> where the water meets the land <eos> sleeping <eos> on the outside of the windowpane <eos> reminds the city man <eos> of natures upper hand <eos> the knots in the wood <eos> make childish issues into wars <eos> write tales of treasure maps ive drawn heard what you said about me <eos> your voice was always shining <eos> say youve never loved me <eos> but you would always love me <eos> did what you always wanted <eos> my soul forever haunted <eos> say you never kiss me <eos> but you could never kiss me <eos> ill try my best to say that its all a waste <eos> its my mistake <eos> and when the lights go out <eos> i will close my mouth and fall asleep <eos> <eos> whisky diamonds <eos> laying on your boyfriend <eos> lonely lonely weekends <eos> gave up on your equation <eos> sweet dreams and masturbation <eos> tell another story <eos> something is always boring <eos> ill try my best to say that its all a waste <eos> its my mistake <eos> and when the lights go out <eos> i will close my mouth and fall asleep <eos> ill try my best to say that its all a waste <eos> its my mistake <eos> and when the lights go out <eos> i will close my mouth and fall asleep <eos> my head shakes when i sleep too long and my mom cries when i sing this song <eos> why cant i be like you <eos> you say things that dont make much sense like the drugs you did or the money you spent <eos> why cant i be so cool <eos> my heart breaks at the drop of a dime and i freak out when i lose my mind <eos> why cant i be like you <eos> i need you and i need to fuck but i talked to you and you dont say much <eos> why cant i keep my cool <eos> black out and i need to sit and i wrote this but it dont mean shit <eos> why cant i be like you <eos> i miss you and i let you down and your voice is the perfect sound <eos> why cant i be so cool im breaking down <eos> i had it all <eos> i taught myself how to walk <eos> and now i can barely crawl <eos> i kiss her lips <eos> we fade to black <eos> mistake ive made are the reasons <eos> were never going back <eos> what we once had was funny <eos> we fucked it up <eos> all these ideas are running out <eos> were growing up <eos> the endless nights <eos> the boring days <eos> the times i let you believe that <eos> i was here to stay <eos> do all the drugs <eos> take all the pills <eos> the times were alone are upon us <eos> and thats what really kills <eos> what we once had was funny <eos> we fucked it up <eos> all these ideas are running out <eos> were growing up <eos> forget the days <eos> we used to dance <eos> i know its wrong but im thinking <eos> that i should take a chance <eos> lets go to bed <eos> take off your clothes <eos> we found the cure but the problem <eos> is nobody else knows <eos> what we once had was funny <eos> we fucked it up <eos> all these ideas are running out <eos> were growing up in the land of the pale blue snow <eos> where its ninetynine below <eos> and the polar bears are roaming oer the plain <eos> in the shadow of the pole <eos> i will clasp her to my soul <eos> well be happy when the ice worms nest again <eos> for our wedding feast well have seal oil and blubber <eos> in our kayaks we will roam the bounding main <eos> all the walruses will look at us and rubber <eos> well be married when the ice worms nest again <eos> and when the blinkin icebergs bound around us <eos> shell present me with a bouncing baby boy <eos> all the polar bears will dance a rhumba round us <eos> and the walruses will click their teeth with joy <eos> final chorus <eos> when some night at halfpast two <eos> i return to my igloo <eos> after sitting with a friend who was in pain <eos> shell be waiting for me there <eos> with the hambone of a bear <eos> and shell beat me til the ice worms nest again clears througt tip toe through the tulips with me ahhhhahhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhh with meeeee tip toe through the tulips verse i <eos> enter sadness with his rainboots in blue <eos> since i can remember ive been runnin from you <eos> but this time you sat your ass down with no intent to move <eos> you aint no blue healer <eos> verse ii <eos> well the longer that you sit here lookin into my eyes <eos> the shock of your arrival it begins to subside <eos> and as i drop my defenses you start to crack a smile <eos> are you a blue healer <eos> chorus i <eos> well ive been proud and <eos> lookin in a mirror thats clouded <eos> with smoke keeping me shrouded <eos> believing im fine <eos> but you wipe clean <eos> all of these illusions that aint me <eos> now youve got me lookin and i hate me <eos> where is my spine <eos> verse iii <eos> peace you told me im only here to reveal <eos> where youve been stuck and where youre going if youre lookin to heal <eos> but youve gotta drop these vain addictions and hang on to whats real <eos> you healer <eos> bridge <eos> i want to welcome every shadow <eos> instead of taking every one to battle <eos> im climbing back up into the saddle <eos> x <eos> chorus ii <eos> and now i stand tall <eos> used to think my sorrow was a brick wall <eos> made me want to curl up in a tight ball <eos> selfpity dealer <eos> but theres a gate here <eos> you can only find it if you wait here <eos> now im walkin through it with my gaze clear <eos> me and the blue healer verse <eos> if youre lost and lonely <eos> go and figure out why <eos> take a trip to your dark side <eos> go on and have a good cry <eos> cause were all lonely <eos> yeah were all lonely <eos> together <eos> i want to see your sadness <eos> i want to share your sins <eos> i want to bleed your blood and <eos> i want to be let in <eos> dont you just <eos> dont we all just <eos> want to be together <eos> chorus <eos> leave whats heavy <eos> whats heavy behind <eos> leave whats heavy <eos> whats heavy behind <eos> verse <eos> if your face is down <eos> take a look around <eos> do your fingers move <eos> do your lungs inflate <eos> are you tired are you weary <eos> of the hidden hate <eos> youve been holding <eos> yeah <eos> did you lose that love <eos> or have you never had it

was the best and the brightest <eos> scared to give what hes got no he wouldnt give it away <eos> selfdeprecation lack of motivation stealing his aliveness <eos> in the silence love abounds and has already filled the spaces <eos> and replaces them with grace if he would only stop to feel to see a desert sunrise you warm my soul <eos> painting me in shades of clay <eos> covering me whole <eos> and im a lizard sunbathing in your radiance <eos> oh i come out of hiding so sweet <eos> so sweet you are <eos> if i could only have a taste <eos> wrap my lips around your flavor <eos> just because you are you <eos> just because you are so beautiful <eos> and ive been waiting all this life <eos> in the company of one <eos> and i know i am young <eos> but i dont want to be alone <eos> if you could only just <eos> consider the two of us <eos> and i know darling <eos> i could be so good to you <eos> i see you rising <eos> on the horizon <eos> bringing light into the day <eos> and im coasting on your rays <eos> when i awoke you spoke through the mist of the mystic bliss <eos> casting shadows <eos> on all my dismal yesterdays <eos> do you remember that you told me darling <eos> that i was so real <eos> i tell you all my tears for you are real <eos> and well cross that bridge again some day <eos> i know we will <eos> i hope we will <eos> desert sunset a lullaby <eos> if i could give it all to you <eos> if youd only let me try <eos> sing so sweetly its my only wish <eos> music drips from your lips like sweet sips of a summers kiss <eos> summer raindrops are precious tongues twist <eos> and ive been waiting all this life <eos> in the company of one <eos> and i know i am young <eos> but i dont want to be alone <eos> if you could only just <eos> consider the two of

<eos> you can sit around and wait for the world to change its ways <eos> you got lucky to live without it <eos> but there will be no place to hide <eos> when youre on the losing side <eos> when the war comes home what will you do about it <eos> when you see the tanks come to the towns you live in <eos> and the bullets they come rippin through your front door <eos> and youre face to face with tyrants killing tyrants <eos> and children killing children <eos> will you know the war <eos> you can sit around and wait for the world to change its ways <eos> you got lucky to live without it <eos> but there will be no place to hide <eos> when youre on the losing side <eos> when the war comes home what will you do about it <eos> what will you do x <eos> when the dust clears <eos> and the profiteers behind closed curtains <eos> send their soldiers to collect their fortunes <eos> from the holes in your chest <eos> will they claim the sky and name it after their kingdoms <eos> the merchants of machine guns <eos> who will win the west <eos> you can sit around and wait for the world to change its ways <eos> you got lucky to live without it <eos> but you cant hide from the shooting <eos> when youre on the side thats losing <eos> when the war comes home what will you do about it <eos> what will you do x <eos> im walking with a burning spirit <eos> but i dont know where it leads <eos> if i ever i lose direction <eos> i know thats where i have to be <eos> im sitting in the meadow asking <eos> how to bend when the strong wind blows <eos> im trying to remember <eos> what my soul already knows <eos> what my soul already knows <eos> i am looking to find <eos> no place at all <eos> my wandering mind <eos> knows who to call <eos> im walking with a burning spirit <eos> but i dont know where it leads <eos> if i ever i lose direction <eos> i know thats where i have to be <eos> when i get to the place im going <eos> surely i will disappear <eos> into forests with no shadows <eos> the curiosity keeps me here <eos> the curiosity keeps me here <eos> i am looking to find <eos> no place at all <eos> my wandering mind <eos> knows who to call <eos> im walking with a burning spirit <eos> but i dont know where it leads <eos> if i ever i lose direction <eos> i know thats where i have to be <eos> i know thats where i have to be <eos> orion is on his head <eos> and my love is out on the ledge <eos> get to the bonfire <eos> and get undressed <eos> my boots are caked with clay <eos> these clothes are loose and my appetites gone <eos> but throw them in the bonfire where we belong <eos> our love is sacred <eos> wounded and naked <eos> like a sunburnt kiss <eos> we are changing <eos> fighting for the same thing <eos> where the lightning lives <eos> and i want to love you <eos> for the way you are <eos> not the way i am <eos> so lets go now <eos> back to the bonfire <eos> where we began <eos> i slow back into my tent <eos> to shake out the vertigo <eos> you know i am up on old <eos> strawberry road <eos> trying to keep my head from spinning <eos> out of control <eos> how much love can one heart hold <eos> you left me wanting more <eos> what can make a house a home <eos> im not so sure <eos> every morning i wake up <eos> with a little emptiness <eos> i try to fill it through the day <eos> but i must admit <eos> whenever i get to feeling lonely <eos> i put some jerry on <eos> and drift until im gone <eos> i let the light come in <eos> through each one of these wounds <eos> everything must have its phases <eos> just ask the moon <eos> i look up and laugh and love <eos> and try to lift <eos> im doing okay i guess <eos> but i must admit <eos> whenever i get to feeling lonely <eos> i put some jerry on <eos> and drift until im gone <eos> i am up on old <eos> strawberry road <eos> trying to keep my head out the gutter <eos> out of the cold <eos> how much love can one heart hold <eos> you left me wanting more <eos> what can make a house a home <eos> im not so sure <eos> mmm strawberry road i saw you dance and sing on stage <eos> with your bare feet and your hair in braids <eos> you press your lips against your heart <eos> if i could only be

nothing not thinking bout death <eos> every little heartbeat every little breath <eos> people walk a tight rope on a razors edge <eos> carrying their hurt and hatred and weapons <eos> it could be a bomb or a bullet or a pen <eos> or thought or a word or a sentence <eos> there aint no reason things are this way <eos> its how theyve always been and they intend to stay <eos> i dont know why i say the things i say <eos> but i say them anyway <eos> but love will come set me free <eos> love will come set me free i do believe <eos> love will come set me free i know it will <eos> love will come set

the witches stare with their limbs akimbo <eos> silhouettes a statues up in the window <eos> call me the coming with the crooked crescendo <eos> but i dont <eos> devotees dance among the <eos> dancing moms on the promenade <eos> into a tabernago on the long <eos> but i dont follow <eos> because shes mine shes mine <eos> shes mine all mine <eos> yeah shes mine mine <eos> mine <eos> midnight mood across the peoples parking <eos> i fled the fire like a spin and spark upon <eos> zoo approaching the dark <eos> she was waiting right there for me <eos> she knows that my hands are empty <eos> as i go pass her mothers a envy <eos> and i dont have to fumble in the dark <eos> for my keys <eos> i believe shes mine shes mine <eos> shes mine all mine <eos> yeah shes mine mine <eos> mine <eos> the pupils gathered in the yard <eos> around the incomprehensible made of cars <eos> and waited for that leaders words <eos> but his words didnt make much sense <eos> his mouth is spat out of fist today <eos> cause in his tongue is swirled in a southern swagger <eos> and i love they all the people gather <eos> but theyre worn in a trance <eos> and shes mine shes mine <eos> shes mine all mine <eos> yeah shes mine mine <eos> mine <eos> i was strong before the quarter canes <eos> toss my soul to the furnace flames <eos> where all my heroes have been slain <eos> exiled or put in prison <eos> because they rose above the mess <eos> and because their power opposed the fading <eos> because they spoke of something else <eos> when everybody else didnt <eos> the music fills the space between <eos> the deities in the prophecies <eos> nobodys pressing the steed <eos> standing in the sand <eos> she looks at me so fearlessly <eos> and i take it all too seriously <eos> but it all becomes a flee to me <eos> and makes me understand <eos> that shes mine shes mine <eos> shes mine all mine <eos> yeah shes mine mine <eos> mine <eos> yeah shes mine all mine <eos> all mine all mine <eos> yeah

centuries <eos> daylight lives like a burden for me <eos> so i escape the sins strewn about the streets <eos> beyond the ruins of my ancestry <eos> five pairs of pages of my disbelief <eos> i rose from my moat like a ghost from a grave <eos> sunken in the salty eyes of the wandering into space <eos> i was heading though the mists across the golden gate <eos> all of my rebellions fall in to the falling fate <eos> so long my misery <eos> i dont need you you have only caused me grief <eos> forgive me if i fall asleep <eos> i havent slept in centuries <eos> springtime came again and it caressed and fell <eos> i flew past the numb lib nuns who never tell <eos> the secrets of the sailors and their seven years spell <eos> i will not fall nor will my wings ever melt <eos> if i could i would wash all these wounds away <eos> i would surround your room with a sinner mans grace <eos> i would paint your portrait over everything mundane <eos> more colorful than easter sunday <eos> so long my misery

but i havent much to say <eos> i was running through the canyons <eos> the echoes of your name <eos> you were laughing at me like the sun laughs at the flames <eos> put me on a page in a book of beginnings <eos> let me scroll through old volumes of age and teachings <eos> let me revel all of these forgotten feelings <eos> lay me with the wretches in the arms of my queen <eos> so long sweet misery <eos> i dont need you youve only caused me grief <eos> forgive me if i fall asleep <eos> i havent slept in centuries <eos> so long sweet misery <eos> i dont need you youve only caused me grief

weve been drifting apart for so many years i hope theyre still marching on <eos> some are probably happy with families working hard to get ahead <eos> some of them are lost some are wandering and some of them are already dead <eos> chorus <eos> who do you think you are its the life you made <eos> dont be afraid of the hands you played <eos> theres an old man sleeping in a parking lot <eos> i wonder what he dreams about <eos> businessmen in suits taking meetings over coffee trying to buy each other out <eos> theres an officer a senator a digger and a sewer a beggar and a thief <eos> they all sit at different tables but they drink the same poison as me <eos> chorus <eos> the power went our and the stars came out and i went out for a walk in the dark <eos> there were fireflies flitting and i heard poets spitting rhymes out in the park <eos> i felt myself drift up off the ground and i rose above the trees <eos> and i saw my life in photographs of faded memories <eos> chorus mama got to worrying <eos> cause her boy left home home in a hurry again <eos> her photograph was fading <eos> she keeps a box in a closet for the maid <eos> that is where <eos> i left the note on the floor in my room <eos> i always been stubborn and late to bloom <eos> i had to lay down my love <eos> my burdens are my own <eos> its a coming of age when you feel it you know <eos> when you feel it you know yes <eos> when you feel it you know <eos> and i know i know <eos> i was longing on a short summer night <eos> when i had the urge to leave <eos> i went out to find my muse <eos> beneath in my pocket and im craving for some <eos> hey jim blues what you said <eos> i was following my fall leaves <eos> when i saw her aboard the river queen <eos> i was courting my creole lady <eos> all the way to new

<eos> i never been knocked off my feet <eos> till you came along <eos> in the room surrounding me <eos> are angels i cannot see <eos> i know they come to carry me to <eos> where i belong <eos> closer to you closer to you <eos> im singing like a sailor strutting up your avenue <eos> like a clown in a costume shop <eos> with a pocket full of jewels <eos> all the knocks upon your door <eos> footsteps fallen on your floor <eos> all the shipwrecks on your shore <eos> mean nothing to me <eos> all the crooks on capitol hill <eos> criminals on the dollar bills <eos> all the money on wall street still <eos> couldnt keep me from getting <eos> closer to you closer to you <eos> like a priest on a pulpit preaching to an empty room <eos> like a drunk in a dive bar in the early afternoon <eos> closer to you <eos> poets could not pronounce your name <eos> gamblers couldnt play the game <eos> matchstick statues set to flame <eos> couldnt hold a candle to you <eos> swindlers on the sunset strip <eos> hypnotists and hypocrites <eos> ventriloquists and pickpockets <eos> wish that they could get <eos> well ive tasted love so sweet <eos> played around but not for keeps <eos> i never been knocked off my feet till you came along <eos> i sit through the trickery <eos> the jealousy and vanity <eos> the potency of your prophesy <eos> because i long to be <eos> closer to you closer to you <eos> like a hound dog in a junkyard honey <eos> im howling at the moon <eos> like a pirate in a pawnshop with a pocket full of jewels <eos> closer to you repeat x <eos> ill get through <eos> oh baby ill get through <eos> closer to you when i heard the news my heart fell on the floor <eos> i was on a plane on my way to baltimore <eos> in these troubled times its hard enough as it is <eos> my soul has known a better life than this <eos> i wondered how so many could be in so much pain <eos> while others dont seem to feel a thing <eos> then i curse my wiseness and i get so damned depressed <eos> in a world of suffering why should i be so blessed <eos> i heard about a woman who lives in colorado <eos> she built a monument of sorts behind her garage door <eos> where everyday she prays for all whom are born <eos> and all whose souls have passed on <eos> sometimes my trouble gets so thick <eos> i cant see how im gonna get through it <eos> but then i would rather be stuck up in a tree <eos> than be tied to it <eos> i know <eos> there is so much more <eos> i dont feel comfortable with the way my clothes fit <eos> i cant get used to my bodys limits <eos> i got some fancy shoes to try and kick away these blues <eos> they cost a lot of money but they arent worth a thing <eos> i wanna free my feet from the broken glass and concrete <eos> i need to get out of this city <eos> lay upon the ground and stare a hole in the sky <eos> wondering where i go when i die when i die you can put a stick in my spokes <eos> i can be the butt of your jokes <eos> i can be the laughing stock i can be your hoax <eos> but i aint gonna lose you <eos> they can come and tear my house down <eos> they can run me out of town <eos> they can tie me up call me a clown <eos> but i aint gonna lose you <eos> i cant stand <eos> the thought of another man <eos> they can make me turn my back on my friends <eos> send me away to up in san quentin <eos> put me in the hole a thousand times again <eos> but i aint gonna lose you <eos> throw me in a hurricane <eos> tell the whole world ive gone insane <eos> run an electric shock to my brain <eos> but i aint gonna lose you <eos> i cant stand <eos> the thought of another man <eos> ill sing it from my roof top <eos> ill sing it from the bus stop <eos> ill sing it on the street drunk to a cop <eos> but i aint gonna lose you i only wanted to be closer to you <eos> i thought i had something to prove <eos> instead i fled with my superstition <eos> because you are a woman <eos> now i was a poet since before i could speak <eos> a mans emotions are what make him weak <eos> i come to you more or less a humble man <eos> because you are a woman <eos> and i find most of the time <eos> im lost inside my own mind <eos> i look all over all over to find <eos> it dont keep me satisfied <eos> all the conquest that i construe <eos> fail miserably in front of you <eos> have you ever been loved by such a charismatic fool <eos> and im a circle for your love <eos> the self sin and struggle crowd the sidewalk <eos> parading pose with phones and paper cups <eos> you walk like truth to a world of fiction <eos> because you are a woman <eos> and i find most of the time <eos> its all inside my mind <eos> i look all over all over to find <eos> it dont keep me satisfied yeah <eos> and i find most of the time <eos> i miss the way your body coils round mine <eos> slope of your shoulders the curve of your spine <eos> because you are a woman <eos> i change my strings and pack my suitcase <eos> im always leaving for some other place <eos> but i return to you again and again <eos> because you are a woman <eos> because you are a woman go if you want to go <eos> but i wont follow <eos> just so you know <eos> leave if you need to leave <eos> but i wont be here <eos> i wont be here when you come home <eos> chorus <eos> im gonna to move to san francisco <eos> look up some old friends <eos> im gonna get me a navy pea coat <eos> and an old mercedes benz <eos> this old town it keeps shrinking <eos> theres too many people in my junk <eos> im gonna do a lot of drinking <eos> cause it dont hurt when im drunk <eos> chorus <eos> im gonna rent me an old victorian <eos> down in the lower haight <eos> im gonna find me an old accordion <eos> play for the tourists on the golden gate <eos> im gonna plant a garden <eos> paint my bathroom blue <eos> im gonna try real hard <eos> to get over you <eos> chorus <eos> here in the city life doesnt move so slow <eos> theres plenty of good people i know <eos> up in north beach they drink spicy italian liqueur <eos> down on market theres a lot of hobos and the hustlers <eos> down in hayes valley theres a lot of real good restaurants <eos> deep in the tenderloin you can get anything you want <eos> over in the mission its always a sunny day <eos> its a real good baseball town but my team is across the bay chorus <eos> this world this world keeps turning turning around <eos> this world keeps turning me upside down <eos> i cant do nothing to slow it down <eos> this world keeps turning and turning around <eos> everything you have today <eos> soon could be gone away <eos> yesterday i had no sorrow <eos> here today and gone tomorrow <eos> here today and gone tomorrow <eos> chorus <eos> people can be so cruel <eos> theyll cheat you and treat you like a fool <eos> theyll drag your dreams through the dust <eos> till you dont know who to trust <eos> i dont know who to trust <eos> the more i learn the less i know <eos> got so far to go <eos> got so far to go <eos> chorus i am a dreamer <eos> and im a lover <eos> ive been let down <eos> ive loved and lost <eos> ive been alone <eos> ive been far from home <eos> chorus <eos> follow your heart <eos> follow your heart <eos> follow your

ive been cheated <eos> ive been defeated <eos> i played the game and ive been <eos> double crossed <eos> every friend of mine <eos> has been in hard times <eos> chorus you know its hard to be yourself <eos> free yourself to see yourself <eos> when all around you there are lies just to get you <eos> spies just to get you to buy so they can get you <eos> there are cameras in the sky lasers in our living rooms <eos> there are wolves watching wearing sheeps costumes <eos> chorus <eos> its enough to make you go crazy whoa <eos> its enough to make you mad <eos> its enough to make you go crazy whoa <eos> and im amazed i havent yet <eos> isnt it a shame the way we cheat each other treat each other <eos> beat each other <eos> its a shame the way we use one other abuse one another <eos> and screw one another its true <eos> they will lock you up in prison but they wont call it slavery <eos> there are stolen children raised and trained in armies <eos> chorus <eos> dont hesitate to speak your mind speak your mind <eos> never hesitate to speak your heart speak your heart <eos> theyll call you crazy when you speak your mind when you speak your mind <eos> so never never hesitate never

it consumes <eos> today i walked without you <eos> like an empty bottle drifting out to sea <eos> i would change it i knew how to <eos> but it dont come that easily <eos> chorus <eos> if my heart wasnt such a jungle <eos> maybe you wouldnt feel so alone <eos> if your her heart wasnt such and ocean <eos> i wouldnt sink like a stone <eos> if you werent so far from me <eos> i could hold you while youre sleeping <eos> and hear you breathing softly <eos> and be there when youre waking <eos> phone calls could not complete us <eos> letters cannot replace <eos> miles and miles and miles between us <eos> another time another place <eos> i have yet to meet another <eos> who burns bright as you <eos> im not looking for any other <eos> i only want you <eos> chorus beyond the rules of religion <eos>

in my old set of clothes <eos> i was half a world away from my home <eos> and i was hunted by the wolves and i was heckled by the crows <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> alongside my innocence i laid in bed awake <eos> conflicted and in chains with the impetus of age <eos> but like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> from its place on the mantel my heart was taken down <eos> scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground <eos> and i below the street lamp like an orphan with a halo <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> cause it wont last worriesll pass <eos> all your troubles they dont stand a chance <eos> and sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> your confidences fall as your faith etched in stone <eos> neither could comfort you from the wild unknown <eos> so bury your burning hatred like a hatchet in the snow <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> if you have a broken heart or a battered soul <eos> find something to hold onto until they go <eos> to help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> cause it wont last your worriesll pass <eos> all your troubles they dont stand a chance <eos> and it always hurts the worst when its the ones we love the most <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> sometimes your path is marked in the sky <eos> sometimes it falls too thin in between the lines <eos> sometimes all that you can do is say no <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> i said when i arrived in my old set of clothes <eos> i was half a world away from my home <eos> and i was hunted by the wolves and i was heckled by the crows <eos> darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> i said darlin do not fear what you dont really know <eos> we said darlin do not fear well i dreamed i went out wandering <eos> i heard promises become fables forgotten <eos> i saw bridges stretching out across the water <eos> and towers pushing taller <eos> i knew my reality was clearly defined <eos> by the fences put up around my mind <eos> i watched them thicken into walls over time <eos> taller than any borderline <eos> i saw civilizations deemed insignificant <eos> i saw peoples history tattooed upon their skin <eos> i saw families taken from their land <eos> dynasty shattered and stolen <eos> and i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution <eos> and all the burdens the centuries accrue <eos> that get passed along to every generations youth <eos> and all the allegories told in lewd truth <eos> i watched them grow wild and spread like a flu <eos> i saw the rise of an untamed industry <eos> and i watched machines print a paper economy <eos> i saw my own self stand right in front of me <eos> and i didnt do a thing <eos> i saw poisons pushed in the street <eos> and prescription pills mingling in the mezzanine <eos> with a whole wealth of doctors and pharmaceutical companies <eos> still poor people were dying from disease <eos> and i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution <eos> and i broke down at the break of dawn <eos> and saw looming in the clouds above the pentagon <eos> as he relives the holocaust as strong as the parkin on <eos> visions incomprehensible vietnam <eos> and i stood silent upon the flooded levee <eos> stared at the ruins of a merchant city <eos> and the president who came to dine with the noble he <eos> he didnt do a thing <eos> i saw three ships come sailing in <eos> through the passage of the caribbean <eos> i saw children coming home in coffins <eos> millions marching on washington <eos> and i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution <eos> i asked when when is the revolution <eos> i asked when is the revolution dys like this its hrd to find wy out feel sofrid better sty in bed <eos> divising pln to try to chnge myself <eos> i know

overpowering me today <eos> closer to you closer to you <eos> i seen what happens to the boys who love you <eos> gonna move carefully real real carefully <eos> i sign for my brothers <eos> now when i write my name <eos> shaquille oneal dont show up <eos> drunk for a laker game <eos> god is down in the mailroom <eos> sorting what gets sent above <eos> they finally proved scientifically <eos> all you need is love <eos> closer to you closer to you superman said "i am weary" <eos> superman said "lets go home" <eos> the trees were strung <eos> with crosses and with ribbons <eos> all the towns and churches <eos> had been bombed <eos> superman stood out in the rain <eos> leaning up against a crumbling wall <eos> still around were mostly cats and lepers <eos> birds no longer soared in the sky <eos> would you come away with me <eos> someday <eos> would you come away with me <eos> some fine day the sermon at the church on hollywood boulevard <eos> is on adam and the fall of man <eos> now i know exactly what they mean <eos> i feel a lot like adam myself these days <eos> fallen to the ground in a ford <eos> fallen from grace in the eyes of the lord <eos> now i think if i had to live outside the garden of paradise <eos> it might as well be spent looking in your eyes <eos> the lies might as well be your lies <eos> the thighs might as well be your thighs <eos> it might as well be with eva <eos> it might as well be with you <eos> i wander the streets <eos> and i wonder if theres something i should do <eos> to prepare for the life to come <eos> maybe i should fall to my knees and try to repent <eos> for the gifts that came and went <eos> im fallen to the ground in a devil disguise <eos> fallen from grace in the angels eyes <eos> now i think if i had to live as one of gods fallen ones <eos> it might as well be spent lying in the sun <eos> with your lips telling me im the one <eos> your fingers shooting me like a gun <eos> it might as well be with eva <eos> it might as well be with <eos> evas such a lucky girl <eos> she dont have a care in the world <eos> she sets fire to the foot of her bed <eos> leaves the righteous shaking their head <eos> i wont be attending the sermon at the church this sunday <eos> on adam and the fall of man <eos> i think i could deliver that message <eos> as god as any preacher in hollywood <eos> im fallen to the ground in a fiery hole <eos> fallen with the rest of my immortal soul <eos> now i think if i gotta spend eternity outside edens gate <eos> it might as well be worth the wait <eos> so if youre the one buttering the bread on my plate <eos> then to hell and back on roller skates <eos> it might as well be with eva walking around the happiest place in the world <eos> but all i do is wonder if your hairs still curled <eos> south of brownsville texas south of miami beach <eos> but all it means to me is that youre further out of reach <eos> everywhere is sand and sun blue sky water too <eos> i need you <eos> the spanish moss is hanging and you find a polished stone <eos> you pocket it for luck and then you walk on alone <eos> theyll rent you a bicycle with the tires blown <eos> theyll cook you up a blackened fish and strip it to the bone <eos> a slave ship just came in <eos> i been talking to the crew <eos> i need you <eos> in that house hemingway is boxing in the back <eos> i go down to the library and check out all the facts <eos> nowadays its hard to write a line my own thoughts bore me <eos> i found me an island kid who says hell do it for me <eos> im wiping all my tears away so no one has a clue <eos> that i need you <eos> the last plane out of saigon did not know that it was <eos> every man in prison thinks hes locked up for a cause <eos> i need something to do my violin needs to sound <eos> im gonna see if ernest wants to go a couple rounds <eos> sometimes you get lost and you find something new <eos> i need you <eos> some birds flapping in the road on some crazy madmans string <eos> somethings messed up with his wing somethings messed up with my everything <eos> so heres the truth at last i tell you <eos> hemingway is dead <eos> and everybody wants to find a steak thats slightly red <eos> i thought i could escape myself by just not getting dressed <eos> i thought i could escape you by coming to key west <eos> sometimes you get lost and you dont find something new <eos> i need you we pulled into rome <eos> with blood in our eyes <eos> after days of travelin <eos> months of lies <eos> taking our various <eos> turns at the wheel <eos> taking booze <eos> and pot and cigarettes <eos> anything not to feel <eos> no one had slept <eos> no one had eaten <eos> our bodies were bad <eos> our spirits were beaten <eos> together we dragged <eos> all of us down <eos> as we staggered through rome <eos> blaming the town <eos> blaming the students <eos> for worship of others <eos> blaming the cops <eos> and blaming their brothers <eos> and never quite looking <eos> ourselves in the heart <eos> and minute by minute <eos> growing further apart <eos> julia julia <eos> where have you gone <eos> why have you vanished <eos> off of my lawn <eos> julia julia <eos> where is your truck <eos> where have you driven <eos> with all of my luck <eos> but even old bull fighters <eos> their grave stones in sight <eos> must search till they unearth <eos> one last bull to fight <eos> and so it was with us <eos> so near to the end <eos> one last story to tell <eos> one last hill to defend <eos> one glance to avoid <eos> one guitar to strum <eos> one untruth to be told <eos> one last song to be sung <eos> and you the most brilliant <eos> most driven most keen <eos> jewel of a bastard <eos> i ever have seen <eos> and you and your turn <eos> a good bitch of the nile <eos> so real to the end <eos> nothing left to defile <eos> and me in the middle <eos> along for the ride <eos> the unwilling distraction <eos> from familiocide <eos> and knowing our weaknesses <eos> no one refrained <eos> from picking <eos> and prodding <eos> till nothing remained <eos> julia julia <eos> where have you gone <eos> why have you vanished <eos> off of my lawn <eos> julia julia <eos> where is your truck <eos> where have you driven <eos> with all of my luck <eos> and now in this kitchen <eos> miles from home <eos> miles from anything <eos> miles from rome <eos> rome was a bust <eos> rome was a scream <eos> rome was the final <eos> rapid eye movement <eos> to this dream <eos> we scattered like leaves <eos> like pieces of dust <eos> warriors watching <eos> their swords and shields rust <eos> and now as we descend <eos> to couches and clocks <eos> to closets and appointments <eos> let us drink to the rocks <eos> let us drink to the sand <eos> to the winds which have blowed us <eos> let us drink to the rivers <eos> let us drink to the road <eos> and if you travel this far <eos> from either conscience or greed <eos> have one piece of advice <eos> that i think you should heed <eos> if ever your travels <eos> take you this far from home <eos> consult your map carefully <eos> stear clear of rome <eos> julia julia <eos> where have you gone <eos> why have you vanished <eos> off of my lawn <eos> julia julia <eos> where is your truck <eos> where have you driven <eos> with all of my luck the day that elvis died was like a mercy killing <eos> america breathed a sigh of relief <eos> we knew all about the drugs and the vegas shows <eos> and there wasnt much of anything that looked like grief <eos> and i guess he shoulda done like james dean did <eos> stead of putting on weight and sinkin down down down <eos> easier to take if hed of just skidded straight <eos> to souvenir city and tshirt town <eos> and sometimes i wish i was smarter that i am <eos> but im on my third city and im on my fourth car <eos> and im on my fifth apartment and so many of my days have sprung <eos> and now its too late to crash too late to burn too late to die young <eos> if pete rose had exploded like roberto clemente <eos> hed be hanging in the hall of fame without fail <eos> can you name the last good film marlon brando made <eos> while trying to keep his kid from goin to jail <eos> and the old people in the street are telling you <eos> dont become like me but every day you creep a little bit closer <eos> and i guess we shoulda done like james dean did <eos> stead of putting on weight and sinkin down down down <eos> easier to take if wed of had just skidded straight <eos> to souvenir city and tshirt town <eos> and sometimes i wish i was smarter that i am <eos> but im on my third city and im on my fourth car <eos> and im on my fifth apartment and so many of my days have sprung <eos> and now its too late to crash too late to burn too late to die <eos> now its too late to crash too late to burn too late to die young well this bald headed girl i know sent me a tape of bjork and courtney <eos> love <eos> and pj harvey called it brilliant women <eos> i put it in my car heard it all the way down to the coast <eos> normally if left to my own devices i dont hear chich singers much <eos> i guess its guys i hear the most <eos> sometimes these days dont it seem like its enough for <eos> girls to love a girl or <eos> use the f word prominently <eos> masturbate in public or <eos> learn guitar tied up to a post <eos> i thought of all this hearing bjork and courtney love and pj harvey <eos> in my car driving to the coast <eos> tori amos liz phair sinead oconnor suzanne vega jill sobule <eos> melissa etheridge <eos> tracy chapman ani difranco michelle shocked <eos> everyone of them has something kind of special that i like <eos> but every now and then while listening to them i feel like when we were <eos> kids <eos> i pulled their hair or stole their bike <eos> these days it seems like theres a lot of girls who sing and some of <eos> them are good and <eos> some of them are not but its always kind of cool that <eos> moment when they first step to the mike <eos> if i was a girl i could sing real high and also then id know what <eos> having <eos> breasts would be like <eos> chick singers <eos> chick singers <eos> chick singers <eos> i started thinking bout <eos> kate bush patsy cline billy holiday janis joplin bessie smith patti <eos> smith <eos> annie lennox chrissie hynde and bonnie raitt <eos> seems like theres an awful lot of women in whose honor i would <eos> like to raise my glass to in a toast <eos> some of them are still alive and some i hear their voices like a ghost <eos> maybe next thursday ill throw a party and invite every woman that <eos> ever sang a song oh this would be a party that i think i would like to <eos> be the host <eos> thanks to the bald headed girl i know whose tape of bjork and courtney <eos> love and pj harvey i heard driving to the coast <eos> chick singers <eos> chick singers <eos> chick singers i saw the best of my generation playing pinball <eos> maked up and caked up and lookin like some kind of china doll <eos> with all of adolf hitlers moves down cold <eos> as they stood up in front of a rock and roll band <eos> and always moving upward and ever upward <eos> to this gentle golden promised land <eos> with the smartest of them all moonlighting as a word processor <eos> and the strongest of them all checking ids outside saloons <eos> and the prettiest of them all taking off her clothes <eos> in front of men whose eyes look like they were in some <eos> little hick town near omaha watching the police chief <eos> run his car off the side of a bridge <eos> i saw men with dreams like the ones id had <eos> beg quarters outside the <eos> till it got so they didnt affect me anymore <eos> then the mailboxes id passed cept that sometimes <eos> id put something in the mailbox <eos> id had the wind at my back <eos> now i felt it cold in my face <eos> and for an awful long time now you were the only one who ever <eos> called me late at night and i really never noticed till after <eos> you stopped calling and the emptiness silence got so heavy <eos> broken up in the wasteland <eos> broken up in the promised land <eos> broken up in disneyland <eos> broken up in the plastic land <eos> broken up in the wasteland broken up in the wasteland <eos> broken up in the wasteland <eos> i saw dead marilyn monroe strung up on every street corner <eos> in hollywood like some two bit whore offering a discount rate <eos> and i wondered how joe dimagio sp felt <eos> i saw dead james deans ghost wandering the sidewalk <eos> looking troubled and i wondered how his mama felt <eos> i saw signs that said head shots done for cheap <eos> signs that said extras wanted top dollars paid <eos> signs for haircuts signs for manicures and <eos> signs for tanning salons and signs for wardrobe specialists <eos> signs for cosmetic surgery and signs for assertiveness training <eos> and i stopped to read them all <eos> and every single block looked like every single block <eos> looked like every single block looked like every single block <eos> looked like every single block but you kept driving <eos> cause everyone else kept driving and cause gridlock <eos> is evil and not knowing your way is evil <eos> and those that had money looked good but werent too happy <eos> and those who didnt have money didnt look so good <eos> and werent too happy either and in a city of three million <eos> two hundred and sixty nine thousand nine hundred eighty four <eos> everyone was lonely <eos> broken up in the wasteland <eos> broken up in the promised land <eos> broken up in disneyland <eos> broken up in the plastic land <eos> broken up in the wasteland broken up in the wasteland <eos> broken up in the wasteland <eos> and i watched as everyone i knew spent their lives <eos> trying to be watched on a stage or watched on a film <eos> or listened to on a record and they thought well maybe <eos> that way i could get a little love out of this life <eos> and i watched as the best of my generation abandoned their dreams <eos> and settled for making a little money <eos> and i watched tv and read the papers and listened to the radio <eos> and made all the fancy scenes and said all the right words <eos> and wore all the right clothes and knew the names of the hip people <eos> but i still felt out of touch so i stopped watching tv <eos> and reading the papers and listening to the radio <eos> and making the fancy scenes and saying the right words <eos> and wearing the right clothes and knowing the names of the hip people <eos> and i felt more out of touch than ever but i didnt care anymore <eos> and i felt you slipping away and i felt myself slipping from you <eos> and i wanted more than anything else for it to rain for one <eos> whole day like it used to but all there ever was was sun <eos> relentless sun hot beating sun and everyone wore their <eos> sunglasses and walked around like flies under a magnifying glass <eos> with their eyes removed youre an all right kind of a girl <eos> good

<eos> another day so far from the farms where i grew up <eos> another day another day another day so far from that single pair of eyes <eos> that speak to me of home not another night alone <eos> another day is done i lay my eyes to rest <eos> theres food ive got a bed and theres a roof above my head <eos> sometimes i think that everyone really speaks a foreign tongue <eos> like i say x and you hear y but i push these thoughts from my mind <eos> and close my eyes and live i close my eyes and live another day <eos> i close my eyes and live i close my eyes and live another day sitting in

broken <eos> were never really made <eos> promises never made <eos> you say the stars quit shining <eos> quit shining on your head <eos> even the moon stopped coming up <eos> some old streetlight instead <eos> but standing in the fields <eos> beneath the universe you hurt <eos> cause as the milky way whirls over you <eos> all you got is dirt <eos> and dont worry bout the jews <eos> theyll do fine in lithuania <eos> and bring a picture of the virgin larry <eos> to your cousin in carolina <eos> and maybe all the promises <eos> you thought were broken <eos> were never really made <eos> promises never made <eos> and im closer to god <eos> than ive ever been before <eos> walking the streets of spain <eos> painting karl marx on every door <eos> groucho marx on every door <eos> mark of

revolutionaries <eos> never bomb buildings <eos> true revolutionaries <eos> never bomb buildings <eos> it attracts too much attention <eos> they never bomb buildings <eos> a little girl down my block was born <eos> with siliconin her breasts <eos> it turned out her grandma and her mother <eos> both had the implants done well <eos> evolution took care of it this time around <eos> and i wondered what it is about <eos> so many women with big breasts <eos> make it look so sad and i thought well <eos> maybe it has something to do with the weight <eos> the burden there is to carry in the world <eos> to have to feed it <eos> to be the object of its desires and <eos> i wondered what burdens the rest of us <eos> are carrying all the time <eos> i couldnt help thinking <eos> true revolutionaries <eos> never bomb buildings <eos> it attracts too much attention <eos> they never bomb buildings <eos> i decided to go for a walk <eos> and not do nothing except look everyone i see in the eyes <eos> and not be the first one to avert my eyes <eos> no matter what <eos> and i was planning to be gone for minutes <eos> but things started happening and i didnt return for two years <eos> by which time i was the heavyweight champion of the world <eos> and the expectant father of children <eos> by different women <eos> i was in a fishing village in the coast of spain <eos> it was our lady of abortions sunday afternoon <eos> all the pregnant women in their first trimester <eos> were filing before the priest <eos> to receive their blessing of <eos> try again sometime try again <eos> the old barber had died his hair green for the occasion <eos> and pierced his nipples and <eos> was riding his skateboard to the statue <eos> of conan obrien <eos> where he was doing backflips for the kids <eos> who threw coins <eos> given to them by their parents <eos> the visiting lecturer <eos> achingly handsome <eos> just finished giving a <eos> how to build bombs in your basement <eos> seminar in the park <eos> all the young girls put away their <eos> notebooks dreamily <eos> the chimpanzee who had managed to <eos> type out hamlet three years before <eos> was sitting in the third floor office of a <eos> drivers license building <eos> typing out zoning ordinances <eos> typing out learners permits <eos> bored and lonely <eos> pee wee herman was sitting in the <eos> central square on the grass <eos> naked and masturbating <eos> while all the townspeople moved to him <eos> slowly and kissed him softly and sung him <eos> lullabyes in the grass <eos> and in burkley and in greenwhich village <eos> and in paris and scottsbluff nebraska <eos> no one sits around in funky little coffee shops <eos> anymore talking about revolution <eos> no they get a starbucks to go <eos> and they go back to their basketball games <eos> where they see who can jump higher <eos> who can jam <eos> who can take it to the rafts <eos> and they all wear baseball caps <eos> except they dont say yankees or dodgers

head full of dark thoughts <eos> like i sometimes get <eos> suddenly everything cleared <eos> and i realized the only purpose <eos> for revolution is to be able to love <eos> who you want <eos> how

odometer in the sky just turned over <eos> lately ive been scattered <eos> my attention span is like a threeyearold <eos> i pick up my guitar and i set it down <eos> try reading booksend up going downtown <eos> my friends say relax and slow down <eos> but my insides feel like a ghost town <eos> tumblin and blowin and all my guts turned over <eos> like a tumbleweed through an empty town turning over <eos> turning over upside down <eos> blowing round and round and round <eos> turning over wrongside up <eos> can barely fill my coffee cup <eos> and i cant find me one new leaf worth turning over <eos> i cant find me one new leaf worth turning over <eos> maybe i should go get in a fight <eos> look for someones honor to protect <eos> maybe ill go down and drink my fill <eos> maybe i can go sign someones will <eos> out there in the alley someones tryin <eos> to start their car but that old thing aint buyin <eos> every time he tries he scrapes the air <eos> but that tired crate shes barely turnin over i met god <eos> on the edge of town <eos> where the wind meets the stillness <eos> where the darkness meets the light <eos> where the ocean meets the sky <eos> where the desert meets the rain <eos> where the earth meets the heavens <eos> on the edge of town <eos> i met god <eos> i asked god <eos> do one thing for me <eos> send me back in time <eos> send me to seattle <eos> let me go <eos> find kurt cobain <eos> take away his gun <eos> take away his bullets <eos> talk to him <eos> make him want to live <eos> tell him how we love him <eos> help him see his glory <eos> god said no <eos> if i sent you back <eos> if you really found him <eos> you would only ask him <eos> if he could <eos> help you get a deal <eos> if he knows a lawyer <eos> if he can help you <eos> god said no <eos> i asked god <eos> do one thing for me <eos> send me back in time <eos> send me to berlin <eos> let me find <eos> the one they call hitler <eos> i will stalk him <eos> i will bring him down <eos> i will bring along <eos> a powerful gun <eos> loaded with bullets <eos> obliterate his memory <eos> god said no <eos> if i sent you back <eos> you would get caught up <eos> in theory and discussion <eos> you would let your fears <eos> delay and distract you <eos> you would make friends <eos> you would take a lover <eos> god said no <eos> i asked god <eos> do one thing for me <eos> send me back in time <eos> send me to jerusalem <eos> let me go <eos> let me go find jesus <eos> let me save his life <eos> as they try to kill him <eos> let me take him down <eos> down from the cross <eos> take the iron from his body <eos> try to heal his wounds <eos> god said no <eos> if i let you go <eos> if you really found him <eos> walking with the cross <eos> you would stare <eos> your tongue no longer working <eos> eyes no longer seeing <eos> ears no longer hearing <eos> god said dan <eos> time belongs to me <eos> times my secret weapon <eos> a final advantage <eos> god turned away <eos> from the edge of town <eos> he knew i was beaten <eos> and now was all i had <eos> god said no when i tell you that i love you dont test my love <eos> accept my love dont test my love <eos> cause maybe i dont love you all that much <eos> dont ask what kind of music im gonna play tonight <eos> just stay a while hear for yourself a while <eos> and if you must put me in a box make sure its a big box <eos> with lots of windows and a door to walk through <eos> and a nice high chimney so we can burn burn burn <eos> everything that we dont like <eos> and watch the ashes fly up to heaven <eos> maybe all the way to india id like that <eos> all the ancient kings came to my door <eos> they said "do you want to be an ancient king too" <eos> i said "oh yes very much but i think my timings wrong" <eos> they said "time is relative or did you misread einstein" <eos> i said "do you really mean it" <eos> they said "what do you think we come here for <eos> our goddamn health or something" <eos> everybodys waiting for the messiah the jews are waiting <eos> christians are waiting also the muslims <eos> its like everybodys waiting theyve been waiting a long time <eos> i know how i hate to wait like even for a bus or something <eos> an important phone call so i can just imagine <eos> how darned impatient everybody must be getting <eos> so i think its time now time to reveal myself <eos> i am the messiah i am the messiah <eos> yes i think you heard me right i am the messiah <eos> i was gonna wait till next year build up the suspense a little <eos> make it a really big surprise but i could not resist <eos> its like when you got a really big secret <eos> youre just bursting to tell someone <eos> it was sort like that with this <eos> and now that ive told you i feel this great weight lifted

saw <eos> you peeling off your teenage bra <eos> the door slightly ajar <eos> oh sister <eos> you lived just across the hall <eos> for eighteen summers eighteen falls <eos> until you went away to that <eos> weird college in wisconsin <eos> and where would willie mays have been <eos> without jackie robinson <eos> and who can say what id been <eos> without you to lead the way <eos> trust yourself

her <eos> stay low invisible and out of sight <eos> and then monica the blade came monica <eos> like god spitting on you a knife in your back <eos> we read it in the paper and moved on to other things <eos> but for you all the colors fade to black <eos> and oh monica there you are monica <eos> on the cross with jesus and martin luther king <eos> just like john lennon by that hotel <eos> you have to pay for our sins <eos> was it like being raped was it like being dead <eos> like a bad movie over and over again <eos> then did everyone who came close to you <eos> suddenly hold a knife in their hand <eos> and now youre back monica <eos> grim and hammering <eos> trying not to think about that thing then <eos> i hope that you win every medal you can win <eos> but it may never be much fun again

day they found a cure <eos> the day they found a cure <eos> the day they found a cure for aids i was painting a still life this morning <eos> of a throat lozenge sitting on a copy of tropic of cancer <eos> the only thing weird about it is that a year ago <eos> i never thought id paint anything again <eos> i decided i wasnt ever gonna paint again <eos> it didnt bother me too much warhols dead <eos> david hockneys still alive i dont need to paint <eos> i painted over ten thousand paintings <eos> sad ones funny ones dark ones and light ones <eos> ive done haystacks and rich old ladies by their pools <eos> wearing nothing but a scarf <eos> ive painted everything there was to paint <eos> now it was time to sit back give interviews <eos> get on the internet hang out at club med <eos> take stock of what ive done <eos> you know the best friend i ever had was a dog <eos> it sounds like a cliche unless its happened to you <eos> some days that dog was the only reason i even got out of bed <eos> that dog went everywhere with me and then i heard the crack addicts <eos> were stealin dogs and selling them for animal research <eos> it sounded like an urban myth to me like the mouse in the coke bottle <eos> but i started leavin her at home after that <eos> you know paula was my wife for a while <eos> she ran off to paris with the great grandson of van gogh <eos> a cartoonist who did fashion graphics for le monde <eos> when paula left she took my dog i never saw her again <eos> except in the court during the custody battle <eos> she won and got to keep the dog <eos> and i didnt speak to anyone for months <eos> you know sometimes it feels <eos> like theres so much that you need <eos> sometimes the world is upside down <eos> sometimes it seems like the only thing you need <eos> is holdin someones hand as you walk through town <eos> i started hanging around with dino <eos> he used to run a poker game back east <eos> now he has a little coffee shop sells cappuccino to his old pals <eos> tommy chicago and jimmy the wig and ugly rose <eos> you know the best person i ever knew <eos> was a mormon woman named estelle <eos> she still calls me drunk every few months <eos> and asks me stuff i dont want to talk about <eos> you cant talk to her long unless youre drunk yourself <eos> then we go all night <eos> yeah she goes "why baby why baby why baby why <eos> have you turned your back on love <eos> you had so many chances <eos> why have you let em all go by" <eos> well one morning i was sitting out in front of dinos place <eos> with jake the shears a guy from philly who gives free mohawks <eos> there were a couple of young painters i was hopin to come by <eos> so i could give em some advice <eos> yeah i was sittin there updating my list of enemies <eos> when this girl walks in and the universe kind of stops <eos> turned out she drank the same tea as me <eos> dont take more than that to start a conversation sometimes <eos> she believed collage was the greatest of all the arts <eos> and was busy pasting pictures of horses next to ads for laundry soap <eos> next to mohammed ali she had a turquoise in her ear <eos> and said rachmaninoff was always in her head <eos> but later that day i was trying to describe her to jimmy the wig <eos> i couldnt find any words and i realized id started to sketch her chin <eos> somehow it didnt look right i scratched it out and tried it again <eos> i filled an entire pad i threw it away i never even came close <eos> for a six days i sat at dinos place <eos> the rain wouldnt quit and no one came in <eos> finally on the seventh day it cleared and in she walked <eos> i asked her to sit with me and i bought her a cup of tea <eos> and i asked her to model for me sometime <eos> that afternoon i was at a canvas <eos> she was wearing a yellow dress <eos> i swore if she let me id get it right <eos> ive painted over ten thousand paintings <eos> sad ones funny ones dark ones and light ones <eos> but sitting there it was like i couldnt even write my own name <eos> i apologized and said "its been a few months <eos> if you have patience ill get the hang of it again" <eos> in the next few weeks i painted her hundreds of times <eos> if i get the nose right the chins too long <eos> if i get em both right the face is too thin <eos> but i keep after it and one day i ill get it all right <eos> i painted a still life this morning of a throat lozenge <eos> sitting on a copy of tropic of cancer <eos> the only thing was funny is that <eos> i never thought id paint anything again <eos> i think i might go visit estelle <eos> those utah mountains are good for the soul <eos> ill bring my brushes and some jack daniels <eos> and we can make up for lost time <eos> and she said "why baby why baby why baby why <eos> baby why have you turned your back on love <eos> you had so many chances <eos> why have you let em all go by" <eos> and she says "why baby why baby why baby why <eos> baby why have you turned your back on love <eos> you had so many chances <eos> why have you let em all go by" <eos> sometimes it seems like theres so much that you need <eos> sometimes the world is upside down <eos> sometimes it seems like the only thing you need <eos> is holdin someones hand as you walk through town i dont feel alright <eos> in spite of these comforting sounds <eos> you make <eos> i dont feel alright <eos> because you make promises <eos> that you break <eos> into your house <eos> why dont we share our solitude <eos> nothing is pure anymore but solitude <eos> its hard to make sense <eos> feels as if im sensing you <eos> through a lens <eos> if someone else comes <eos> ill just sit here listening to the drums <eos> previously i never called it solitude <eos> and probably you know <eos> all the dirty shows ive put on <eos> blunted and exhausted like anyone <eos> honestly i tried to avoid it <eos> honestly <eos> back when we were kids <eos> we would always know when to stop <eos> and now all the good kids are <eos> messing up <eos> nobody has gained or <eos> accomplished anything youve been searching <eos> have you found many things <eos> time for learning <eos> why have i not learnt a thing <eos> words with no meaning <eos> have kept me dreaming <eos> but they dont tell me anything <eos> and all you never say is that you love me so <eos> all ill never know is if you want me oh <eos> if only i could look into your mind <eos> maybe then id find a sign <eos> of all i want to hear you say to me <eos> to me <eos> are you uncertain <eos> or just scared to drop your

million pieces thrown out across the ground ive tried to be fair <eos> and pretend like i care <eos> but no asset is worth all the time <eos> spent listening and laughing <eos> to dramas that mean nothing <eos> cant find any depth to these minds <eos> purity lost in vain <eos> you think i should be the same <eos> dont assume i will follow <eos> and drop all my morals <eos> so you can look good for the crowd <eos> you dont care for my thoughts <eos> just the light that i brought <eos> im tired of helping you out <eos> they chose to be blind <eos> when lonely and shy <eos> i searched for acceptance at first <eos> said the trait didnt match <eos> now you take it all back <eos> when it adds something more to your worth <eos> purity lost in vain <eos> you think i should be the same <eos> dont assume i will follow <eos> and drop all my morals <eos> so you can look good for the crowd <eos> you dont care for my thoughts <eos> just the light that i brought <eos> im tired of helping you out <eos> all this time you chose never to care <eos> but now you wont leave me alone <eos> like weve always been close <eos> im telling you nothing has changed <eos> purity lost in vain <eos> you think i should be the same i feel your knife as it goes right in <eos> cut to my core but im not bleeding <eos> all that you say trying to make me small <eos> well the bigger you get the harder you fall <eos> you use your words as a weapon dear <eos> but your blades dont hurt when you have no fear <eos> you think that youre deep under my skin <eos> youre trying to keep me suffering <eos> if you use your words as a weapon <eos> then as a weapon ill shed no tears <eos> you have my heart but i lock it up <eos> this burning flame has been burnt enough <eos> my windows cracked they can be replaced <eos> but your arm will tire throwing stones my way <eos> you use your words as a weapon dear <eos> but your blades dont hurt when you have no fear <eos> you think that youre deep under my skin <eos> youre trying to keep me suffering <eos> if you use your words as a weapon <eos> then as a weapon ill shed no tears <eos> i feel your knife as it goes right in <eos> you use your words as a weapon dear <eos> but your blades dont hurt when you have no fear <eos> you think that youre deep under my skin <eos> youre trying to keep me suffering <eos> if you use your words as a weapon <eos>

minded <eos> to keep up with the words you say <eos> that make me feel so young <eos> but i dont know where this is going <eos> ive just been hoping <eos> and i can see by your smile that youre glowing <eos> inside out <eos> lets not pretend like its not what it is <eos> when im just starting to realise <eos> that i love you <eos> and i wish that we were strangers <eos> strange enough to go unnoticed <eos> from this crowd <eos> and i wish that we were closer <eos> close enough for me to hold you <eos> when youre lonely nights become too long to bare <eos> but i dont know where this is going <eos> ive just been hoping <eos> and i can see by your smile that youre glowing <eos> inside out <eos> lets not pretend like its not what it is <eos> when im just starting to realise <eos> that i love you <eos> you hold your head up high <eos> though its hard to <eos> i cant keep back i know <eos> i just want you <eos> but i dont know where this is going <eos> ive just been hoping <eos> and

its just maybe <eos> and were only dreaming <eos> for how this will go oooh <eos> but maybe one day this daydream <eos> will turn into real things <eos> for all that we know oooh <eos> we could be doing anything that we love <eos> just be carried by the way the wind blows oooh <eos> you could be doing anything you dream of <eos> if you believe in the things that make you strong <eos> someday well meet on the high street <eos> well laugh about when we <eos> worried about what we might be <eos> then maybe well talk about old days <eos> well smile in our old ways <eos> youll always be a part of me <eos> we could be doing anything that we love <eos> just be carried by the way the wind blows oooh <eos> you could be doing anything you dream of <eos> if you believe in the things that make you

night <eos> and keep you from the loneliness of yourself <eos> heart strung is your heart frayed and empty <eos> cause its hard luck <eos> when no one understands your love <eos> its unsung and i say <eos> goodnight my love to every hour in every day <eos> goodnight always to all thats pure thats in your heart i can be strong when i want to be <eos> you think im weak cause you can tear me apart with the words that you speak <eos> you think youre in control <eos> but you dont understand how much youre wrong <eos> you choose to lash out at me ive done nothing wrong <eos> all you crave is attention and just to be loved <eos> you need to be loved <eos> and i want to be free <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and forgiveness seems too bold <eos> i still find it in my heart <eos> to say "i love you" <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and the hurt is just too bold <eos> i still find it in my heart <eos> to say "i love you" <eos> is there not enough to use your love for me <eos> to get past the things who cause you envy and hate <eos> and the fights that they bring <eos> you say youre looked on as small <eos> cant understand why you dont have it all <eos> but you dont know how i fight for you and believe in your aims <eos> i just wanna do right by you forget what has changed <eos> cause nothing is changed <eos> and i want to be free <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and forgiveness seems too bold <eos> i still find it in my heart <eos> to say "i love you" <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and the hurt is just too bold <eos> i still find it in my heart <eos> to say "i love you" <eos> but you have to be so mean <eos> youre such a drama queen <eos> the way you prey on every weakness that you see in me <eos> to make you strong you are alone <eos> so dont pretend like you can hardly breathe <eos> like its down to me <eos> cause its so unfair that you cant succeed but youre so wrong <eos> were still so young <eos> and i want to be free <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and forgiveness seems too bold <eos> i still find it in my heart <eos> to say "i love you" <eos> when my heart is made from gold <eos> and the hurt is

<eos> they made me think of you <eos> they made me think of you <eos> oh lights go down <eos> in the moment were lost and found <eos> i just wanna be by your side <eos> if these wings could fly <eos> for the rest of our lives <eos> im in a foreign state <eos> my thoughts they slip away <eos> my words are leaving me <eos> they caught an aeroplane <eos> because i thought of you <eos> just from the thought of you <eos> oh lights go down <eos> in the moment were lost and found <eos> i just wanna be by your side <eos> if these wings could fly <eos> oh damn these walls <eos> in the moment were ten feet tall <eos> and how you told me after it all <eos> wed remember tonight <eos> for the rest of our lives <eos> if these wings could fly <eos> oh lights go down <eos> in the moment were lost and

<eos> wed remember tonight <eos> for the rest of our lives <eos> if these wings could fly <eos> oh lights go down <eos> in the moment were lost and found <eos> i just wanna be by your side <eos> if these wings could fly <eos> oh damn these walls <eos> in the moment were ten feet tall <eos> and how you told me after it all <eos> wed remember tonight <eos> for the rest of our lives in the morning when you wake up <eos> i like to believe you are thinking of me <eos> and when the sun comes through your window <eos> i like to believe youve been dreaming of me <eos> dreaming hmm hmm <eos> i know <eos> cause id spend half this morning <eos> thinking about the tshirt you sleep in <eos> i should know <eos> cause id spend all the whole day <eos> listening to your message im keeping and never deleting <eos> when i saw you <eos> everyone knew <eos> i liked the effect that you had on my eyes <eos> but no one else heard <eos> the weight of your words <eos> or felt the effect that they have on my mind <eos> falling hmm hmm <eos> i know <eos> cause id spend half this morning <eos> thinking about the tshirt you sleep in <eos> i should know <eos> cause id spend all the whole day <eos> listening to your message im keeping and never deleting we know full well theres just time <eos> so is it wrong to toss this line <eos> if your heart was full of love <eos> could you give it up <eos> cause what about what about angels <eos> they will come they will go make us special <eos> dont give me up <eos> dont give <eos> me up <eos> how unfair its just our love <eos> found something real

screwing each other <eos> and anything theyve found <eos> every face i see weeps with a colour i cant describe <eos> weeping tears and dreams that are just swept aside <eos> who are to scared to speak up <eos> breathe the air the evil the change <eos> the memories that are oh so strange to us <eos> its all become clear with this song in my ears <eos> this song in my ears <eos> and i know theres something sick <eos> with what ive been sold <eos> ive been tricked poisoned mislead <eos> in what ive been told <eos> oh baby you dont listen much <eos> to what i know i know i know i know <eos> and our hearts are lit with darkness <eos> falling down down down down down down down theres a drama in the street <eos> that youre dragged into <eos> bad company and you go <eos> but you dont want to <eos> the bats are coming <eos> as you close your eyes <eos> and then youre <eos> in a strange bedroom <eos> lying on the floor <eos> i know youd like to captivate <eos> but youll have to try <eos> harder then your other friends <eos> who just happened to die <eos> you picked the wrong girl off the streets <eos> and my nails are sharp <eos> slicing through your banded knee <eos> and your wanton heart <eos> and oh you know theres something <eos> that i can never say <eos> i live in my own darkness <eos> with giant birds of prey <eos> and oh you know from up here <eos> we watch and burn and reign <eos> well swoop down on your faces <eos> and satiate <eos> theyre no protection no relief <eos> from all the silence of your screams <eos> and your sweaty sheets <eos> stuck in doors you only cry <eos> only cry for more <eos> hot out of sadness out of fright <eos> breaking down the door <eos> but i could only guess that you would think the worst of me <eos> but im of another world where day is night <eos> and all the heat is dripping from my skin <eos> dripping from my soul <eos> and i am hollow in this space <eos> like a black hole <eos> and oh you know theres something <eos> that i can never say <eos> i live in my own darkness <eos> with giant birds of prey <eos> and oh you know from up here <eos> we watch and burn and reign <eos> well swoop down on your faces <eos> and satiate i am under a spell of a melody <eos> its an epidemic in the key of d <eos> its simple its sophisticated <eos> play it for me once ill have herd it thousands of times <eos> by the moonlight above me i will seek <eos> one day ill even find <eos> crys of these thats all i could want or need <eos> its a musical its a philosophy <eos> you control its movements and it controls yours <eos> desire frustration will it make me smile with another polyphonic line <eos> whyd you have to go and be so rude by falling into my audience tonight <eos> crys of these thats all i could want or need <eos> shake it <eos> well dont fight it thats just suicide <eos> how am i suppose to prosper <eos> from what cant be bought <eos> its a plague cough its a miracle <eos> i almost could have told you that holding the tip of my tongue <eos> could ever want to flirt with the thought of holding that one more refrain <eos> crys of these thats all i could want or need it hasnt been this bright <eos> in a century and a third <eos> at this time of night <eos> in the great wide world <eos> the moon is overhead <eos> her light shines down on me <eos> its lovely how it hits the deck <eos> making shadows of the trees <eos> does anybody have a light <eos> im cold as a stone <eos> and its dark in the night <eos> and im up here all alone <eos> youve got this power over me <eos> my shadow hungers for you <eos> but we must not ever meet <eos> no weve got to play it cool <eos> get yourself a life <eos> give yourself another name <eos> become somebodies wife <eos> itll ease up all the shame <eos> does anybody love you <eos> does anybody love you <eos> well ive got to go get waxed <eos> i cant have shadows by noon <eos> you just stay put and relax <eos> ill be round again soon <eos> does anybody

crying as i left your gates <eos> or that your maintenance men they caught our last embrace <eos> well you were on the verge of tears when i first knew i would know you <eos> and now your ancient black tears they stain your robe <eos> calypso will come with me on that morning april day <eos> to the city of my childhood in a cage <eos> on the broad back of the earth we will drive twelve hours straight <eos> and well take turns feeling crazy and okay <eos> on may day may day listen for the sound <eos> of the ambulances singing rounds drowning out the blue <eos> well the captain of america he sings through his toothpaste <eos> and the bubbles of his words will float away <eos> as he gargles out a hymn in the funny fish voice way <eos> and all the sorrow seems to go away <eos> on may day may day listen for the sound <eos> of the geiger counters counting down <eos> to one and blast off baby to the interspace of stars <eos> out to the star encrusted boulevard <eos> on may day may day can you hear the sound <eos> of the megaphones calling out instructions <eos> and i need your quiet empire where forgetful persians roam <eos> and with two hands full of silver ill go home <eos> return me to my kingdom where my children wait for me <eos> to build them flying saucers <eos> on may day may day they are going down <eos> send the fleet of blackandwhites wailing downtown <eos> may day may day may day stay if you want <eos> there is enough <eos> sadness for the <eos> both of us <eos> follow the sound <eos> to the table underground <eos> there will be plenty <eos> tears goin round <eos> and i would be happy <eos> for you to stay <eos> with me til tomorrow <eos> can become today <eos> in a sad world <eos> in a sad world <eos> but when you leave <eos> by powders and my teas <eos> will speak <eos> their heads off to me <eos> here everyone knows <eos> their own name <eos> in a sad world <eos> no two are the same <eos> real soon assures the spoon <eos> watch out says the time <eos> water give me water <eos> remember me begs the rhyme <eos> of a sad world <eos> of a sad world while you were sleeping your babies grew <eos> the stars shined and the shadows moved <eos> time flew the phone rang <eos> there was a silence when the kitchen sang <eos> its songs competed like kids for space <eos> we stared for hours in our makers face <eos> they gave us picks said "go mine the sun <eos> and go gold and come back when youre done" <eos> uh oh <eos> while you were sleeping you tossed you turned <eos> you rolled your eyes as the world burned <eos> the heavens fell the earth quaked <eos> i thought you must be but you werent awake no <eos> you were dreaming you ignored the sun <eos> you grew your power garden for your little ones <eos> and you found brides for them on christmas eve <eos> they hung young cain from the adam trees <eos> and danced uh oh <eos> while you were sleeping i tossed and i turned too <eos> i closed my eyes but the future burned through <eos> the planet turned a hair grey as i relived the day <eos> while you were sleeping the money died <eos> machines were harmless and the earth sighed <eos> the wind you swept sound and gravity brought my love <eos> around <eos> the oceans rose sang about decay <eos> the witches flew and the mermaids stayed <eos> full of dreams you overslept <eos> in keeping with the quiet through the walls i crept <eos> i walked on tiptoes sent darkness swirling over all <eos> the kitchen <eos> in the early morning <eos> uh oh uh oh <eos> ill never catch up to you who sleep so sound <eos> my yawns are useless my heart beats too loud <eos> to go to sleep my minds too proud to bow out <eos> while you were sleeping the time changed <eos> all your things were rearranged <eos> your vampire mirrors face to face <eos> they saw forever out into space and found you dreaming <eos> in black and white <eos> while it rained in all the colors of the night <eos> uh oh uh oh <eos> i watched the tvs memories champion ships vanish to sea <eos> can it be my honey between you and me <eos> so i waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by <eos> sunrise <eos> and i made a death soup for life <eos> for my fathers ill widowed wife <eos> did you have that strangest dream before you woke <eos> cause in your gown you had the butterfly stroke <eos> did it escape you like some halftold joke <eos> when you reached for your plume of smoke <eos> and itll haunt you my honey bee <eos> anyone whos anyone has that same dream <eos> were you falling were you flying and were you calling <eos> out or were you dying <eos> but thank god youre up now lets stay this way <eos> else therell be no mornings and no more days <eos> cause when were dreaming the babies grow <eos> the stars shine and the shadows flow <eos> time flies the phone rings there is a silence <eos> when everybody tries to sing <eos> uh oh uh oh we walked the aisles aimlessly <eos> with our kills painlessly <eos> and we go all the night without love <eos> in the darkened lonely corners <eos> where we place our drivethrough orders <eos> and we go all the night without love <eos> without love <eos> "touch me" the graphic reads <eos> on the magnetic athletic insole <eos> she lets it go all its life without life <eos> and can you imagine going to <eos> "got milk dot com" <eos> do you go all the night without love <eos> without love <eos> well i once caused your cells to shimmer <eos> and you once caused my cells to shimmer <eos> now we go all the night without love <eos> without love last night was the sciencefiction <eos> movie

hat jean cocteau is covered in butter <eos> the ghosts of cappucino and zaza hover <eos> in the hallway where the devil and his lover <eos> beg you for change on the slide <eos> theres nothing really like a french blues <eos> blown by an unknown soldier in you <eos> to all your regrets and you rouse <eos> ill meet you down there when i try <eos> and do you ever wonder <eos> where you go when you die <eos> emiles vietnam in the sky <eos> well id take better care of your heart <eos> youll be opening a sswiss bank account <eos> let go its over now play your part <eos> youll be swinging those milk clouds on high i heard a sound <eos> when i was a child <eos> someone was walking through the pillow that night <eos> the snow muted <eos> the pitch of night <eos> a shadow approached across a field in white <eos> its only me <eos> its only me <eos> and the sound of my heart it startled me <eos> as i drifted <eos> from the dark room <eos> face lifted from the paper moon <eos> reflected in the orbit bath <eos> he manages to say before he starts to laugh <eos> you cant always trust <eos> the darkness and the dust <eos> but me im just a man <eos> its more than i can understand <eos> its only me <eos> the white noise <eos> falls away <eos> to reveal the perfect day <eos> where roses bloomed <eos> out of thin air <eos> and music rose from down the buried stairs <eos> its only mine <eos> its only mine <eos> i grew it in the shade <eos> when the sun couldnt shine <eos> and at times i dont know why <eos> the tears come to my eyes <eos> and what if i go blind <eos> as they flow out of my mind <eos> it worries me <eos> it worries me <eos> that theres someone on my mind <eos> who i dont see <eos> i close my eyes to disappear <eos> into the fields of stars between my ears <eos> the dark <eos> as they overlap <eos> we follow one another <eos> as we fade to black <eos> its only night <eos> its only night <eos> an ultrasound when i was alive <eos> the shadows go spying on the ones in the wild <eos> they dip their arrows <eos> into the sea <eos> they wash their arms <eos> as they wait for me <eos> they wait for me <eos> they wait for me <eos> hey wait for me <eos> hey wait for me the tents go up <eos> as i go down <eos> down to the flats and into the sound <eos> the closer i get to the city <eos> the further i am from memory <eos> in the green grass looking up <eos> for the words of the angry sun <eos> no one when he says no one <eos> yeah he means no one <eos> no one <eos> no one will survive <eos> ash wednesday alive <eos> no soldier no lover <eos> no father no mother <eos> not a lonely child <eos> in the up and in the bedroom <eos> a black and white of the bride and the groon <eos> will bring me to my knees <eos> with the colorized bad dream <eos> that takes its place on <eos> ash wednesday <eos> white noise and love <eos> will be my only drug <eos> on this day nine <eos> suns away <eos> from that sad sad saturday <eos> when fire my friend <eos> fire my villain <eos> you take away yesterday <eos> to give to me today <eos> when nothings free no now its <eos> ash wednesday <eos> so each day is ash wednesday <eos> all this life is ash wednesday <eos> all the doors are shut <eos> and the windows barely opened up <eos> the fires all around <eos> its the ending of the drought <eos> and we are ready now <eos> for tear gas clouds <eos> on my mind <eos> come on fill the house <eos> finally and weep <eos> for its king and queen sleep <eos> both now <eos> in the arms of <eos> ash wednesday <eos> ash wednesday and now the night and the liquor wear off <eos> i see your sister more clear <eos> now that the sun has warmed the sky <eos> wont you sleep my lady <eos> go to sleep baby <eos> no i cant sleep now baby <eos> its true i loved her then yes <eos> and you deserve far better than this mess <eos> its true i loved her then forever <eos> but now its you that i love always loved never <eos> now the night and the liquor coming on <eos> i hardly

inside this song <eos> we will be safe here <eos> as the light is long <eos> that makes way for good friday <eos> get out of your body <eos> for there goes your blood <eos> it falls on my secrets <eos> and colors the flood <eos> the time of our fathers <eos> is not ours to kill <eos> their sad cellared wines <eos> are not ours to spill <eos> and wont be passed over good friday say youre a much nicer person <eos> since the hogs heart was inserted in you <eos> say how it is now with your new life <eos> well theres no more aching <eos> or a heart breaking <eos> theres no more bacon for me

<eos> through all manner of jetsam <eos> to a pier where man on holiday <eos> would lean to his navel reflection <eos> hear now or never loves <eos> now finally the bride of the primrose parade <eos> on the float monsanto sprayed <eos> steps beyond the poisoned moats of her petticoats <eos> o loves i have led you astray <eos> turn this serpent round <eos> pass the flower kids my crowns <eos> and go move in the way of the sun <eos> though i wither your work is begun <eos> and with that in petals she fell to the stage <eos> in the system the feedback raged <eos> now or never loves <eos> now or never loves <eos> now or never loves step from the dark bright ocean <eos> cradled by the interior wave <eos> under the song so long time gone <eos> come outnumber the days i have waited <eos> so many suns <eos> erased them <eos> so greyfaced <eos> i have faced them <eos> league upon league <eos> i have turned them <eos> awaiting my kind <eos> my kind <eos> my kind <eos> my kind of girl <eos> i conjure you <eos> and you produce me <eos> an offwhite heir <eos> for my vanity <eos> come down from the beams <eos> stardust mam <eos> make her my kind <eos> my kind <eos> there and then <eos> wide ocean end <eos> break into another world <eos> if tomorrow im gone <eos> i know youll carry on <eos> and me out on a radio wave <eos> step step down from the dark bright ocean <eos> bleed your shape where you stand <eos> rise from the grasses where all earth time passes <eos> like a wind through the land <eos> its high time <eos> hight time <eos> my kind <eos> my kind of girl <eos> my kind <eos> my kind <eos> my kind i turn up like midnight <eos> like the edge of town <eos> of all the loose matches <eos> ill move among the found <eos> in fact theyll call me sire <eos> as i rise to the crown <eos> i came for fire <eos> a stickup a cave no sound <eos> quiet the sirens <eos> down every dead end seed <eos> let in to the sun way <eos> the eye teeth <eos> the diet white tiger <eos> i force her to feed <eos> i came for fire <eos> my shade grows long against the trees <eos> lift the trumpet <eos> lead the unicorn <eos> into the night <eos> no more forlorn <eos> the tower is wired <eos> to fall to a thorn <eos> i came for fire <eos> i put it to each all form <eos> just one second <eos> before we end <eos> and back to the stars <eos> return again <eos> i can hear the choirs <eos> from inside the curtain <eos> i came for fire <eos> if i go i know i come back again <eos> or i stay for love oh to be somewhere <eos> or somebody else <eos> oh to have someone <eos> all to myself <eos> say that you love me <eos> say good lines <eos> say that the love you have <eos> wont ever die <eos> in my head i hear a telephone <eos> with the roundest ring <eos> to the tune of a future <eos> where no god on high sings <eos> from no wet hall of heaven <eos> no great echoing song <eos> just the steam off a dream where <eos> absolutely nothing goes on <eos> but me out of my mind <eos> feed my body to the crowd <eos> i already feel pointless <eos> the size and the shape of a cloud <eos> all today all at once <eos> everything changed under the sun <eos> oh i was totally surprised mentally preparing for years <eos> when it flashed before my eyes oh it was more than i could fear <eos> my world far behind me oh what a ringing of the ears <eos> oh to be somewhere <eos> or somebody else <eos> oh to have someone <eos> all to myself <eos> say that you love me <eos> say no more lies <eos> say that the love you have <eos> wont ever die <eos> all today <eos> all at once i saw a woman <eos> out in the evening <eos> going her mary way <eos> up a city block <eos> stricken by a strange pose <eos> bent out of shape <eos> the pose of a puppet <eos> master gone <eos> looking up and in <eos> to a light across the road <eos> she froze for a moment <eos> then moved on <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> when i came to <eos> where shed been <eos> i looked around for a mirror <eos> and found in its place a billboard <eos> beaming down a model <eos> in the echo of her body <eos> selling no yelling yelling <eos> the black jean <eos> and looking up and in <eos> to the light across the road <eos> i froze for a moment <eos> then moved on <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> take it off of me <eos> well live this way forever <eos> ill make you the fairest babe <eos> thats ever been <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> dada da <eos> dada da instrumental took a powder from a life <eos> of a carrion type <eos> mystery meats <eos> in the dull before dawn o <eos> i was brought up <eos> in the early night <eos> said oh well <eos> alright with eyes <eos> on the mountains <eos> since my work as <eos> a young girl <eos> but now way <eos> way new age <eos> way way new age <eos> from the cradle with a bang <eos> to the garden state i came <eos> when a voice sang to me <eos> and this exactly what it said <eos> will you be the rose to the stone <eos> will you come to drive the needles own <eos> theyll say what theyll say <eos> o and youll translate it o <eos> the morning from night <eos> way way out of the way <eos> way way out of the way <eos> yet fully formed i sprang <eos> the wind in my cell rang <eos> i came all the way up the vein of interstate <eos> to be the rose the stone <eos> a bloom of new flesh on the bone <eos> o say what youll say <eos> o honey ill translate it o <eos> the morning from night <eos> the jet into a powder form of light <eos> taken at the head of a new life <eos> once more you make it through the night <eos> on the floor the sleepers open wide <eos> a door to the feeder of the fire <eos> sings me to life on the vine o cruel other <eos> mark my word i say <eos> in the am i am long gone an am

where the angel strumpets open up <eos> the perfect figures wade weighed <eos> in on the shape of the atom made <eos> my dear mother <eos> dont you lay wake <eos> fix on the river flowing only for heavens sake <eos> this is all just a chemical change <eos> a return to native states <eos> see major changes <eos> in an ocean around each man <eos> my undoing will be by my own hand <eos> wave after wave i am winding up the sand <eos> where my babies play <eos> the fresh fallen atom made te he perdido entre la gente <eos> te he adorado y te he odiado <eos> y en el fondo sabes bien <eos> que en los peores momentos <eos> llevas dentro un ã¡ngel negro <eos> que nos hunde a los dos <eos> y cuando llega el nuevo dã­a <eos> me juras que cambiarã­as sã­ <eos> pero vuelves a caer <eos> te dolerã¡

the dark and sinks into <eos> the place i need you most <eos> as far as the east from the west they say <eos> i should know my east from west i know <eos> as far as the east from the west they say <eos> and i am only human anyway <eos> now for all your cares <eos> put them in the air that i breathe in <eos> until you tell me "no" <eos> and for the smallest hands <eos> put them in my hand and i walk on <eos> until you say "let go" <eos> as far as the east from the west they say <eos> i should know my east from west i know <eos> as far as the east from the west they say <eos> and i am only human anyway how you found me out i still never understand <eos> thoughts you cant take with you when you go <eos> you were waving flags that bare the colors <eos> of your love i didnt know <eos> orange for the vineyards <eos> blue is for the rivers <eos> green goes like a hillside covered now <eos> white is not surrender <eos> despite what youve been told <eos> its clouds of hope <eos> that fall on you now save you now <eos> fall on you fall on you now save you now <eos> one time we met you were outside <eos> floating in the forest i placed my stigmata <eos> on your hands little flowers that you have sown <eos> show people you have known <eos> that i am love and <eos> fall on you now save you now <eos> fall on you fall on you now save you now <eos> and fall on you now save you now

days turn into one <eos> im in a coat and hat <eos> and im standing on the coast of england <eos> with a castle and cathedral on the sand <eos> i reached down to touch the water with my hand <eos> then you turn and say to me <eos> "youve been talking in your sleep <eos> what did you see what does it mean" <eos> i was a photograph <eos> of our day trip from the window of a train <eos> the one we cut in half <eos> i kept mine and made a bookmark on a page <eos> it fell out today as i was getting packed <eos> have i left you here more times than ive come back <eos> like that snowfall out of reach <eos> we kept our details underneath <eos> once made of stone we went for broke <eos> i didnt know <eos> are you a dreamer shes the kind of girl that tends to brown <eos> freckles on her elbows and her knees <eos> and im the boy that passes through these towns <eos> i leave before we find out what it means <eos> ill send a letter addressed to you <eos> it says youre my california brown and blue <eos> another chorus line gives into waves <eos> it fades away <eos> so i push through another hotel door <eos> and i pull back the bed sheets till they break <eos> and i sleep so hard i dont even dream <eos> weightless in the arms of golden gate <eos> the only music i want to hear <eos> is the sound of the last light left disappears <eos> another songbird gives up its wings it fades away <eos> dada dada dada <eos> dada dada dada <eos> ill send a letter addressed to you <eos> it says youre my california brown and blue <eos> another chorus line gives in to waves <eos> it says your my california golden gate <eos> the only music i want to hear is the sound of the last light that disappears <eos> another songbird gives up its wings <eos> it fades away <eos> another songbird gives up its wings <eos> it fades away dream are you a dreamer <eos> are you a dreamer <eos> do you dream <eos> sleep are you a sleeper <eos> are you a sleeper <eos> do you sleep <eos> when your brown eyes close <eos> do blue skies open up <eos> when your breathing slows <eos> your mind run fast and free <eos> will you sleep and dream with me <eos> love are you my lover <eos> are you my lover <eos> do you love me <eos> save are you a savior <eos> are you a savior <eos> will you save <eos> when my blue eyes close <eos> will white clouds lift me up <eos> when my body slows <eos> my mind run fast and free <eos> do you hold me when i sleep <eos> do you hold me when i sleep <eos> when your brown eyes close <eos> do blue skies open up <eos> when your breathing slows <eos> your mind run fast and free <eos> will you sleep and dream with me <eos> will you sleep and dream with me <eos> water im walking on water <eos> walking on water for you lately i been waking to <eos> the bluest stars that i once slept through <eos> the morning hangs like open chords <eos> that i fill in with my own thoughts and words <eos> i used to worry all the time <eos> but i slowed down to live my life <eos> to live my life now <eos> college campus and warmest grass <eos> we sit and watch the people rush to class <eos> when did we to decide that life had to be <eos> all fasts and cheques that we lost mystery <eos> we used to worry all the time <eos> but we slowed down to live our lives <eos> to live our lives now mary you are the bird inside the hand <eos> of st francis in the garden where he stands <eos> handwriting a birth mark and a quilt <eos> mother to my mother and to me and to me <eos> mary you are the mason jars in spring <eos> the kitchen with the view across a hill <eos> first memory is a bible verse in song <eos> the organ while my family sings along we sing along <eos> and on the calendar when i leave <eos> a little note for you so you see <eos> when im gone i never go too far <eos> your heart is my heart <eos> your blood my blood <eos> when im gone i never get too far <eos> mother to my mother and to me can you hear the ringing of the bell tower <eos> counting off the days we cant replace <eos> i would like to think its not that way <eos> all the songs that find you in the city <eos> pull you from your bedroom to the streets <eos> pushing all your sadness underneath <eos> theres a song ive been singing <eos> all these years as they pass <eos> theres a lot of big questions i never ask <eos> theres a lot of questions never asked <eos> consider the lilies of the valleys <eos> neither do they toil or they spin <eos> still a quiet hand is watching over them <eos> i became a prodigal and left here <eos> my petals out like windmills in the air <eos> waiting for a breeze <eos> for any sign of care <eos> theres a song ive been singing <eos> all these years as they pass <eos> theres a lot of big questions i never ask <eos> theres a lot of questions never asked this is what its like <eos> finding your feet again <eos> the part of you that couldnt <eos> finally thinks you can <eos> youre taking off some time to do this <eos> a small apartment bedroom rearranged <eos> to know that you are loved <eos> youre finding your feet again <eos> the part of you that couldnt <eos> finally thinks you can <eos> a brownstone on a street in brooklyn <eos> the light tier flash from temperature to time <eos> and people do the same <eos> youre falling asleep again <eos> part of you a dreamer <eos> and part of you is dreamt <eos> and you said all of the words keep coming <eos> for me to settle down <eos> but i think i heard us falling <eos> before we hit the ground <eos> so much for my dark takes <eos> on how we got this far <eos> funny that we cant make a thing <eos> of what we really are <eos> she sits on the bed <eos> shes so beautiful <eos> she thinks ill be scared of what shes feeling <eos> its time you ought to know <eos> time you had the facts <eos> "im feeling like this if you can live with that" <eos> i dont believe in some things <eos> like living for myself <eos> and i dont believe in loving <eos> unless theres someone else i hear you calling me by name <eos> you come around the corner smiling again <eos> and i know <eos> youre feeling better <eos> and so the sun might turn to rain <eos> the clouds will come together over us again <eos> and they <eos> will soak us to our bones <eos> comfort our thoughts when were feeling down <eos> say what we need until we come around <eos> as a matter of fact <eos> a matter of these times <eos> when were all feeling <eos> its getting hard to breathe in this life <eos> im going back now to the time <eos> when we sat out all night and looked to the sky <eos> and dreamed it would be our escape <eos> and so that night did turn to day <eos> the sun so bright and warm <eos> and make its way inside of me <eos> send a shiver through my bone <eos> comfort my thoughts when im feeling down <eos> say what i need until i come around <eos> as a matter of fact <eos> a matter of these times <eos> when were all feeling <eos> its getting hard to breath in this life <eos> i dont know what im doing now <eos> i dont know what im doing now <eos> i make myself so sick inside my bones <eos> comfort my thoughts when im feeling down <eos> say what i need until i come around <eos> youre the matter of fact <eos> the matter of these times <eos> when were all feeling <eos> its getting hard to breath in this life open your life <eos> can you feel me rushing in <eos> and unshield your mind <eos> i can tell what you are thinking <eos> and all you hold inside <eos> was just as much mine <eos> the same questions of who <eos> the same stories i hide <eos> and i know that this is your beginning <eos> blow me a kiss <eos> i can feel it hitting my face <eos> and what have i missed <eos> why are you leaving my embrace <eos> and whats left to do <eos> i can think where you are <eos> but you know that i cant blow my kisses that far <eos> hold my hand <eos> while youre leaving for japan <eos> say youll stick around repeat x <eos> dont be surprised <eos> sometimes i think youre way out of my class <eos> and push off the time <eos> what im left with youre still my photograph i need to take a look before you go away <eos> before i spend my time with what i need to say <eos> youre so free around everyone but me <eos> its the city lights <eos> and its a new york sky <eos> you dont want to hear <eos> and im not ever right <eos> you should be with anyone but me <eos> we talk around everything <eos> i need to hear a word before you go away <eos> but you dont speak of my hurt <eos> and that might never change <eos> you could be with anyone but me i believe when we were younger <eos> we thought that we deserved the sun <eos> i met you when you were <eos> i was pushing <eos> the sentiment the twists and turns begun <eos> living close to philadelphia <eos> we would go there now and then <eos> i liked all the different restaurants <eos> neighborhoods and river bends <eos> together we made plans that went <eos> i would move there first <eos> in a year youd come down <eos> and id keep my place here <eos> youd find yours across town <eos> sharing sets of keys <eos> to our rooms and bigger things <eos> we would write our names on this place <eos> in a way that could not be erased downtown in the fall <eos> across the sidewalks <eos> the leaves will all make fossils left behind <eos> balancing your life this way against mine <eos> i know youre in me somewhere <eos> i have the marks to prove of this <eos> closer to the sun <eos> out in the open farms <eos> to the reason for this growing i will come <eos> and you will be near <eos> and i am not old <eos> when we are close together we are young <eos> if i had no arms to fold into <eos> if i had no joys to breathe back to you <eos> surely this could slow the life of mine <eos> surely this could stop the love of mine <eos> far from everyone <eos> down where the river runs <eos> to the reason for this valley i will come <eos> and wash myself there <eos> of all of my cares <eos> through mystery and water there is love <eos> there is love i think its fair <eos> to say that i knew you best <eos> way back when <eos> the place you live <eos> the things youll do <eos> the choice you have that i could never understand <eos> you could throw it all away <eos> or you could throw it back to me <eos> i wont leave <eos> i think its fair <eos> to say youve changed <eos> but day by day thats something i can understand <eos> you could throw it all away <eos> or you could throw it back to me <eos> i wont leave <eos> im sorry that it ends this way <eos> i hope you can still love me <eos> i wont leave well get in my car around that night <eos> for the new york city skyline <eos> destination of our sights <eos> its the biggest healing session that ive had for some years <eos> the laughter and the driving and the letting go of <eos> she seems to have a way of making me feel <eos> you always have a way of keeping me real <eos> hold me my world is closing <eos> help me to keep it open <eos> we stand in the parking lots of late afternoons <eos> talking of the ways we pray for healing of wounds <eos> she seems to have a way of bringing me down <eos> you always have a way of bringing me out <eos> hold me my world <eos> we feel the push of <eos> the love directed life for us <eos> we feel the push of <eos> the christ directed life the love directed life <eos> hold me my world what will stay <eos> when everything is going what remains <eos> when everything is leaving when all has slipped away <eos> what will stay <eos> what will change <eos> when everything is different whats the same <eos> when everything is leaving when all has slipped away <eos> what will change <eos> bridge <eos> am i safe <eos> when everything is going im afraid <eos> when everything is changing if nothing good has stayed <eos> am i safe this cannot be real <eos> lookin out into the cold <eos> this window holds a view <eos> of you and i and growing old <eos> i would call you now <eos> if i had strength on telephones <eos> i would call you now <eos> and say the words to bring you home <eos> this cannot be real <eos> lookin out into the rain <eos> this window holds a view <eos> of you and i and how things change <eos> i would call you now <eos> if you werent sleeping three hours from here <eos> i would call you now <eos> and sing the words that bring you near this was the first year of our years togather <eos> your mother got sick <eos> and your sister got married <eos> and this was the first year of our songs togather <eos> simple cords are lovely <eos> simple words are heartfelt <eos> its the best friends that need

from natural wood to olive green this year <eos> and the bedroom was done over <eos> to keep up with the fashion of the time <eos> and through the doorway theres a couch where <eos> we killed the afternoon without a try <eos> through the doorway theres a couch where <eos> we killed the afternoon <eos> i was pulled for conversation <eos> on a payphone at the place downtown you were <eos> and i

journey and love is the trip <eos> and the study of them will make you hip <eos> im professor of the rap and when i speak <eos> i guarantee that my lines will not be weak <eos> they say a mind is a terrible thing to waste <eos> thats why im here and on the case <eos> rapping up every mind with a special degree <eos> in sociopsychologbe <eos> the gary byrd experience is my course <eos> when you take my class you will feel the force <eos> cause i know the roots that the rap is from <eos> when i speak to you i am not dumb <eos> hear my rap and begin to dance <eos> and i promise you this you will advance <eos> you may have seen the raiders of the lost ark <eos> but you still left the theatre in the dark <eos> so clap your hands to the beat as the wondersound <eos> and the gbe shine on the crown <eos> you wear the crown i wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> the crown <eos> i said once upon a time in alkebu <eos> lived the kings and queens who looked like you <eos> it was a land of sun with a golden shine <eos> a place that once was yours and mine <eos> home of a many great dynasties <eos> who created science and astronomy <eos> where the romans came to study math <eos> and the greeks found out about the path <eos> in case you wonder what else they did <eos> the alkebulans created the pyramids <eos> and before napoleon could even blink <eos> in alkebu there stood a giant sphinx <eos> some say they came from outer space <eos> but they are a part of the human race <eos> if you know the place where they can be found <eos> you may be the one who can wear the crown <eos> you wear the crown i wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> the crown <eos> i wear the crown you wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> get down <eos> we wear the crown we wear the crown <eos> not the greatest dancer with the baddest shoe <eos> not the slickest rapper that you ever knew <eos> have worn the crown though they wanted to <eos> and theyll want to until they die <eos> not a man of science with a phd <eos> not a lady of law masters degree <eos> will wear the crown unless they can see <eos> a unique reality <eos> you see when you say you wear the crown <eos> you make sure you know it is profound <eos> in case it sounds like a mystery <eos> im talking about our story <eos> it can make agamemnon nodd to you <eos> it can make neffertiti beckon you <eos> with the crown you will begin to glow <eos> when its secret you begin to know <eos> next time you feel like youre in a rut <eos> go see the mighty kingdom of king tut <eos> it will blow your mind no doubt its true <eos> cause guess what king tut looks just like you <eos> you were cleopatra queen of the nile <eos> the sun would wink when it saw your smile <eos> you were the hannibal of the history book <eos> and the earth would tremble at your very look <eos> you were the builders of the pyramids <eos> you were the face upon the sphinx <eos> you rode on the nile in grace and style <eos> look at yourself today and think <eos> see the hieroglyphics upon the wall <eos> like the dancers on the floor they will not fall <eos> if you take one look it will astound <eos> and then you will see who wears the crown <eos> you wear the crown i wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> the crown <eos> i wear the crown you wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> get down repeat <eos> i do recall so very well when i was just a little boy <eos> i used to hurry home from school i used to always feel so blue <eos> because there was no mention in the books we read about my heritage <eos> so therefore any information that i got was education <eos> bums hobos at depot stations i would listen with much patience <eos> or to relatives who told the tales that they were told to pass ahead <eos> but then one day from someone old i heard a story never told <eos> of all the kingdoms of my people and then how we fought for freedom <eos> all about the many things we have unto the world contributed <eos> you wear the crown <eos> we wear the crown we wear the crown <eos> its not star wars its not superman <eos> its not the story of the kukluxklan <eos> the crown will appear in the gbe <eos> but its never seen on your tv <eos> its in black and white in your gold mind <eos> a picture so old it defies time <eos> alex haley drew it in his book <eos> its what kunta kept in his other foot <eos> ghana songhay and old mali <eos> they are the roots of your own family tree <eos> kingdom so vast and knowledge wise <eos> they removed cataracts from human eyes <eos> and yet today some refuse to see <eos> and live in fear of their discovery <eos> now in fourteenhundred and ninetytwo <eos> columbus sailed the ocean true <eos> but years before in alkebu <eos> a ship set sail with a chocolate crew <eos> years before columbo came <eos> the olmecs built tributes to their fame <eos> stone heads with faces eight feet high <eos> that the hulk could not lift to his thigh <eos> though the facts historians avoid <eos> first to arrive was the africoid <eos> it may shock the house and shockley too <eos> and if youre not prepared it may shock you <eos> while some had doubts that the world was round <eos> in america guess who wore the crown <eos> you wear the crown i wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> get down <eos> when you wear the crown you will not need <eos> to smoke to coke to dust or speed <eos> with the crown you can become the high <eos> and you will make it if you try <eos> but dont you ever forget what it will take <eos> to wear the crown you cannot fake <eos> if youre gonna lead you gotta be a king <eos> and give the world your everything <eos> or be a man like malcolm x <eos> and demand for all the very best <eos> or conduct a railroad like harriet <eos> we all owe her a lifetime debt <eos> if youre gonna fight dont do it free <eos> make em pay to see just like ali <eos> or sing like ella and make them guess <eos> is it you or is it memorex <eos> if you play a sport become number one <eos> like joe louis and jackie robinson <eos> make dr j your shining star <eos> shoot with magic dunk with jabbar <eos> or if you can write then write some books <eos> like langston hughes or our ms brooks <eos> if you think youre smart dont deceive us <eos> be an imhotep be a genius <eos> and dont let anybody confuse the fact <eos> you dont wear the crown just because youre black <eos> everybody in the world has a crown in place <eos> that becomes their culture and their face <eos> and so it is we will not deny <eos> our history or buy the lie <eos> we have no claim to be renowned <eos> when we were first to wear the crown <eos> you wear the crown i wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the crown <eos> the crown <eos> i wear the crown you wear the crown <eos> so proud to say that we all wear the

i havent felt this lonely <eos> since the first i saw your face <eos> the lights are burning slowly <eos> cracklin in the fireplace <eos> the autumn winds are blowing <eos> and were still here in this place <eos> but after everything <eos> theres nothing that i would erase <eos> and id do it all again <eos> if i could do it all again <eos> your silver hairs still glowing <eos> but are we ever going to end <eos> stay with me until i fall asleep <eos> but dont let me fall in too deep <eos> i think im losin sight <eos> but youre still shinin bright <eos> so dont turn out the lights <eos> you say youre lonely <eos> well baby that makes two of us <eos> you and me only <eos> but im the one whos serious <eos> the lights are dimming <eos> and theres nothing that can change it now <eos> cause youre still spinning <eos> on that fool that you still love somehow <eos> and id do it all again <eos> if i could do it all again <eos> and i want you to love me <eos> like you used to love me <eos> before we ever met <eos> stay with me until i fall asleep <eos> but dont let me fall in too deep <eos> i think im losin sight <eos> but youre still shinin bright <eos> so dont turn out the lights <eos> i havent felt this lonely <eos> since the first i saw your face <eos> the lights are dying slowly <eos> ashes in the fireplace <eos> the winter winds are blowing <eos> and were still here in this place <eos> but after everything <eos> theres nothing that i would erase <eos> stay with me until i fall asleep <eos> but dont let me fall in too deep <eos> i think im losin sight <eos> but youre still shinin bright <eos> so dont turn out the lights she walks slowly past your eyes <eos> and you know its no surprise <eos> that you will never know miss temptation <eos> youll go out and touch the trees <eos> feeling the warm breeze <eos> but you know that youll never feel miss temptation <eos> and you cant believe <eos> things youve never seen <eos> but you know that she lives on <eos> and if you dont exist <eos> whats left to be missed <eos> if you will never have miss temptation <eos> shell walk right up to your face <eos> but youll never embrace <eos> and you know that youll never taste miss temptation <eos> and she walks away so slow <eos> but you know shell never know <eos> that you have always loved miss temptation <eos> and you cant believe <eos> things youve never seen <eos> but you know that she lives on <eos> and if you dont exist <eos> whats left to be missed <eos> if you will never have miss temptation <eos> and so as she walks away <eos> you think you hear her say <eos> i never wanted to be miss temptation <eos> so by now shes almost home <eos> but you know she wont be alone <eos> because someone else awaits miss temptation the blue light on the tv glows upon your face <eos> your bodys warm and your eyes are closed wrapped in this embrace <eos> and id do anything i could to keep you here with me <eos> to feel our fingers interlocked to feel you loving me <eos> this night is so quiet that i dont think i could imagine leaving this <eos> but imagination can often be painful when i just want to feel your kiss forever <eos> forever <eos> i just go crazy when im without you <eos> all of my instincts tell me that i need you <eos> if i could have this slowdance id never let you go <eos> our bodies move like poetry ive never read before <eos> but when this dance is over ill still be holding on <eos> waiting here holding you so near <eos> til we hear the next song <eos> these couples around us the ones that surround us <eos> could they possibly feel as euphoric as i do when i am with you <eos> and can you make it feel this real forever <eos> forever <eos> i just go crazy when im without you <eos> all of my instincts tell me that i need you <eos> i need you <eos> i wanna dance <eos> i wanna dance <eos> i wanna dance with you forever <eos> forever im awake <eos> woke up in a random room <eos> i think i woke up too soon <eos> i confess <eos> that this world dont feel like mine <eos> i feel dead and so does time <eos> once weve woken up <eos> from the prison of the womb <eos> we are given to her arms <eos> strangers to this room <eos> i can breathe <eos> but i know lifes not lived with ease <eos> so get off your dirty knees <eos> and wake up <eos> for all we know may be a lie <eos> when the body goes the soul may also die <eos> so are we hanging on <eos> to anything at all <eos> if theres nothing to hold but faith <eos> theres nothing to do but fall <eos> i cant relate <eos> im too fucked up to understand <eos> but i can offer you my hand <eos> so hold on <eos> cause there is no master plan <eos> is it possible that god was born of man <eos> dont be afraid to live <eos> for everything youre worth <eos> everything you are is yours <eos> from the day youre born to earth <eos> im awake <eos> and i am all i need to be <eos> and i am nothing if im not free <eos> i cant sleep <eos> when you mean everything to me <eos> and no fiction will ever take that away from me <eos> there is no way to know <eos> whatll happen when we die <eos> but ill say it now that art is where the human spirit lies i know that someday ill be yours <eos> i aint got nowhere else to be <eos> on a distant islands sandy shore <eos> im already out to sea <eos> the thought of us is all i see <eos> i want it to be all i know <eos> but its not yet reality <eos> how much further do i go <eos> and its too late to fool ourselves <eos> that theres nothing there <eos> and its too late to pretend that we dont care <eos> and i dont want to wait <eos> until its too late <eos> if love equals frustration <eos> then its frustration that i crave <eos> but when this is an obsession <eos> i just want to be saved <eos> now i know that if i drown <eos> only i can be blamed <eos> for i feel my body dragging down <eos> and my ships sailing away so howre you doing now <eos> that youre looking out <eos> over the life that faces you <eos> does it make you doubt <eos> the plans that you laid out <eos> all the certainties that you thought you knew <eos> you should only live <eos> how you want to live <eos> dont just aim to be what your father is <eos> a ventriloquist of your influences <eos> just know theres more to life than this <eos> another headache <eos> the biggest one that you will ever have <eos> will be when you learn <eos> dont die a virgin to your life <eos> you know those things called dreams <eos> well theyre not all they seem <eos> without a lot of hard hard work <eos> and you may lose your steam <eos> and hell you may lose me <eos> but dont ever lose yourself <eos> another headache <eos> the biggest one that you will ever have <eos> will be when you learn <eos> dont die a virgin to your life <eos> so now that youre adrift <eos> in all your own whatifs <eos> you may find it hard to breathe <eos> but soon your thoughts will sift <eos> and youll be happy if <eos> you lose that virginity <eos> another headache <eos> the biggest one that you will ever have <eos> will be when you learn <eos> dont die a virgin to your life when i first touched your skin <eos> that was when i knew <eos> that i would die to spend another night with you <eos> i could stay out late <eos> but all that i would do <eos> is think about spending another night with you <eos> theres no other goal <eos> id rather pursue <eos> than the chance to spend another night with you <eos> youre all the time <eos> youre everyday <eos> youre all my life <eos> you are the moment <eos> you are today <eos> and you are tonight <eos> you are tonight <eos> as i stumble through the dark <eos> nothing feels more true <eos> than my wish to spend another night with you <eos> so ill go to sleep <eos> in this bed for two <eos> and dream about spending another night with you <eos> and if the morning comes <eos> as it will often do <eos> ill just wish to spend another night with you <eos> i cant wait to spend another night with you <eos> i cant wait to spend another night with you its the second time it happened <eos> the time on your bed <eos> your hand on my hair <eos> my hand on your head <eos> and i can close my eyes when youre around <eos> and i can hold my breath when youre around <eos> and i can tell you all when youre around <eos> and i can never fall when youre around <eos> and if we can stick to each other <eos> then we can never <eos> we can never fall <eos> you close your eyes again <eos> but the night it never ends <eos> you fall asleep again <eos> but the night it never ends <eos> and i can close my eyes when youre around <eos> and i can hold my breath when youre around <eos> and i can tell you all when youre around <eos> and i can never fall when youre around <eos> and if we can stick to each other <eos> then we can never <eos> we can never fall <eos> never fall <eos> now i can finally smile <eos> and i know that i can mean it <eos> and i can really smile <eos> and i know that you can see it <eos> and i can close my eyes when youre around <eos> and i can hold my breath when youre around <eos> and i can tell you all when youre around <eos> and i can never fall when youre around <eos> and if we can stick to each other <eos> then we can never <eos> we can never fall <eos> we can never fall if theres a time when you must go <eos> tell me things i didnt know <eos> the sun was warm your hand was strong <eos> wish i was there with you that day <eos> on an empty highway <eos> riding to the falling sky <eos> i look around nothings what it seems ohoh <eos> cant tell the worst from the best in me ohoh <eos> these fading lines are all i see ohoh <eos> now i understand it all shines brightest at the end <eos> i heard you call my name <eos> it sounded like a distant echo <eos> but then i knew yeah then i saw <eos> that

across the sky <eos> and a woman with no family wishing to die <eos> a mother buries her new blonde son <eos> and a father in his office holding a gun <eos> a little girl touched in places she should never be <eos> a little boy left to live alone in the streets <eos> a wife who doesnt know how to be faithful <eos> and a husband that cant seem to keep his cool <eos> and the world is screaming x <eos> fistful of anger and hearts full of hurt <eos> dreams that took gothemland dead in the dirt <eos> they say the temperature is rising and the water will too <eos> isnt really anything that we can do <eos> theres plenty of bread but the corrupt wont share <eos> where are all those who are suppose to care <eos> were all waiting for a a messiah to come <eos> but we cant agree on who he is or which or so on <eos> and the world is screaming x <eos> he came in a major he was borned in a stable <eos> and he did what no man before he was able <eos> and he lived a perfect life he forgave us or not <eos> convinced a few that he was the son of god <eos> but his father was good his father had a plan <eos> so he handed him over to be killed by men <eos> they beat him and they beat him and they hung him on a tree <eos> he asked his father why have you farsaken me <eos> but his father was good his father had a plan <eos> so he raised him back to life and now he is sitting at his right hand <eos> he listens to us he hears our pleas he joins with us on our knees <eos> and the world is screaming x <eos> and the world is screaming <eos> and the world is screaming <eos> and the world is

the days <eos> do you wanna do you wanna <eos> well do you wanna resurrect some golden age <eos> do you sometimes wish you could turn back the days <eos> do you wanna wanna wanna wanna wanna it is neither fair nor reasonable to expect sadness <eos> to confine itself to its causes like a river in flood <eos> when it subsides and the drowned bodies of <eos> animals have been deposited in the treetops there is <eos> another kind of damage that takes place beyond the torrent <eos> at first it seemed as though she had only left <eos> the room to go into the garden and had been delayed by stray <eos> chickens in the corn then he had thought she might <eos> have eloped with the rodeoboy from the neighboring <eos> property but it wasnt till one afternoon when he <eos> had heard guitar playing coming from her room and <eos> had rushed upstairs to confront her and had seen <eos> that it was only the wind in the curtains brushing <eos> against the open strings that he finally knew she <eos> wasnt coming back he had dealt with the deluge alright <eos> but the watermark of her leaving was still quite visible <eos> he had resorted to the compass then thinking that <eos> geography might rescue him but after one week in the <eos> victorian alps he came back north realizing that snow which <eos> he had never seen before was only frozen water <eos> ill take you to hollywood <eos> ill take you to mexico <eos> ill take you anywhere the <eos> river of money flows <eos> ill take you to hollywood <eos> ill take you to mexico <eos> ill take you anywhere the <eos> river of money flows <eos> but was it really possible for him to cope with the <eos> magnitude of her absence the snow had failed him <eos> bottles had almost emptied themselves without effect <eos> the television a samaritan during other tribulations had <eos> been repossessed she had left her traveling clock <eos> though thinking it incapable of functioning in <eos> another timezone so the long vacant days of expensive sunlight <eos> were filled with the sound of her minutes with the measuring of her hours diamonds on the water at five oclock <eos> lovers lie around in tangled knots <eos> pulling your picture from a cardboard box <eos> forget you not forget me not <eos> i dont want to change a thing when theres magic <eos> i dont want to change a thing when theres magic <eos> in here now the coast is clear <eos> i got no time for fear <eos> time knocks you down like a rolling ball <eos> in memory hall <eos> love leaves you clean like a waterfall <eos> then you hit a wall hit a wall <eos> i dont

colored sand <eos> everythings fresh at the source in this land <eos> everythings fresh at the source in this land <eos> and i wish him luck <eos> i hope he gets it right <eos> as he lives my live <eos> hes got a house all to himself that overlooks a park <eos> hes got a piano all to himself that he plays after dark <eos> i know the sound <eos> as the sun goes down <eos> everythings fresh at the source as the sun goes down <eos> everythings fresh at the source as the sun goes down <eos> and i wish him luck <eos> i hope he gets it right i lived in seclusion for a couple of years <eos> in a german farmhouse just drinking beer <eos> and every morning id wake up with a smile from ear to ear <eos> i had one contact to the outside world <eos> a phone in london and a seasick girl <eos> i knew what was happening but only in my part of the world <eos> i knew what was happening <eos> i knew that this was my world <eos> i knew what was happening in my part of the world <eos> there was an abandoned castle with empty chairs <eos> there was a rumour pavarotti would sing there <eos> to raise funds for a music school but then the <eos> whole thing vanished into thin air <eos> it was a crazy idea <eos> and it vanished into the air <eos> it was a falling down castle with falling down stairs <eos> i could walk the streets unrecognized <eos> nobody stopped me i was never surprised <eos> by anybodys actions or by an exlovers eyes <eos> and this felt good <eos> and this felt so right <eos> to be unloaded as i walked through the night <eos> this felt good <eos> this felt so right <eos> to be unloaded as i walked through the night this felt right <eos> search <eos> show options <eos> hide options <eos> default <eos> artist name <eos> song name <eos> lyrics content <eos> more

wondering why <eos> things dont work out right no they never seem to work out right <eos> oh nothing ever works out right no it never ever works out right <eos> but theres always tonight theres always tonight <eos> lying awake i think about tomorrow <eos> how many miles it would take <eos> to walk around this sorrow <eos> sitting on top of my hands watching the world go by <eos> tapping my feet on the floor wondering wondering <eos> wondering wondering why <eos> sitting on top of my hands i am sitting on top of my hands <eos> and things dont work out right no they never seem to work out right <eos> but theres always tonight yeah theres always tonight <eos> theres always tonight yeah theres always tonight i know a place where we can hide away <eos> i know a place where we can always stay the same <eos> for all these things i dont care for <eos> the world is burning but its cold outside <eos> the world keeps turning but we stay and hide away <eos> for all these things i dont care for <eos> for all these things i dont care for <eos> where do they go when the sun rises <eos> i wanna take you to the morning light <eos> i wanna take your hand and walk with you tonight <eos> i wanna take you to the rainbows end <eos> where we can dance around with all our friends and then <eos> where do they go when the sun rises <eos> see them walk away <eos> through the strangeness <eos> they escape <eos> i wanna take you to the morning light <eos> i wanna take your hand and walk with you tonight <eos> i wanna take you to the rainbows end <eos> where we can dance around with all our friends <eos> i wanna take you to the other side <eos> i wanna take your heart and hold it tight tonight <eos> i wanna take you to the rainbows end <eos> where we can dance around with all our friends

jumped in bins to find my meals <eos> oh yesterday who would have thought it would turn out this way <eos> oh yesterday who would have thought it would turn out <eos> looking back at the days when i was still at school <eos> i had a view of the world all i wanted was a boyfriend <eos> had money in my pocket and a coat on my back <eos> then the music man came and now theres no turning back <eos> oh yesterday who would have thought it would turn out this way <eos> now im back on the cigarettes <eos> been working my fingers down to the bone <eos> im covered in dirt from the dusty road <eos> and will i ever find a place i can call my own <eos> oh yesterday who would have thought it would turn out this way dont know if its politics or big fat lies <eos> but somethings changed in your eyes <eos> and i can see the world through you <eos> youre like a crystal ball <eos> you wonder why the skys gone grey <eos> and all the birds have flown away <eos> i can see the change in you <eos> thats changed us all <eos> jumpin leaps and bounds from day to day <eos> ive seen her grow as she finds her way <eos> and i can see the world through you <eos> youre my crystal ball <eos> the sky has changed from grey to blue <eos> the birds are back singing nursery tunes <eos> and i can see the change in you thats changed us all <eos> you could change the world if you can change yourself im a breather mail receiver <eos> ad i dont know where i stand <eos> not since someone informed me <eos> that my house was built on sand <eos> and its not the earth beneath me <eos> its just the concept of the land <eos> and im standing on the corner <eos> when the buildings they all fell <eos> and you blink once youre a goner <eos> everything just goes pellmell <eos> its a real hard sell my conceptual hell <eos> not even good for kindling no <eos> when the buildings they all fell <eos> and im a breather mail receiver <eos> bottom feeder just getting by <eos> and you know its all just part of the course <eos> but you blame it on some non existent force <eos> oh yeah of course you know you cant ride <eos> the concept of the horse but still i try <eos> in a carton desert landscape <eos> with a pair of acme jet skates <eos> focused on my destination <eos> i seem to have forgot my station <eos> now its time to face the nation <eos> and im riding to meet you <eos> on a brown gray speckled mare <eos> but theres something that unnerves me <eos> like im riding on thin air <eos> these few doubts disserve me <eos> thinking no one really cares <eos> and im jumping over fences <eos> on this obstacle course <eos> but it seems im getting nowhere <eos> on the concept of the horse <eos> its a real hard sell my conceptual hell <eos> not even good for kindling no <eos> when the buildings they all fell <eos> and im a breather bottom feeder <eos> how many liters must i imbibe <eos> and you know its all just part of the course <eos> but you blame it on some non existent force <eos> oh yeah of

<eos> when your head starts craning back <eos> and your breath comes short and fast <eos> the music of the spheres start to bounce and sing <eos> thats when you know youre swinging <eos> when your eyes roll back into your head <eos> and the sap from the trees on your fingers have bled <eos> swooning to the charms of mephistos waltz <eos> thats when you know youve got some schmaltz <eos> when youve got the evil eye and unconsciously growl <eos> your hands start shaking and you crouch and prowl <eos> these terrifying symptoms are a sure fire sign <eos> that youre pimping baby and youre feeling fine too long you waited too long to come home <eos> now your daddy dont want you no more <eos> too long you dont belong here anymore <eos> so quit your knock knocking at my door <eos> yeah

youve read <eos> the poison of truth <eos> all the movies and cds stare at me <eos> a wall of your life <eos> and now youre telling me that what you need <eos> is so very different from what i am <eos> and now you will not stay <eos> no matter if i should say <eos> that when i slept breathing the nape of your neck <eos> it was the only time i felt awake <eos> all your tears are sweet like saline <eos> they streak your face but cant displace all your grace <eos> you float like a queen <eos> all the words we have heard are so absurb <eos> but i think you believe just a bit <eos> in loves receipe theres no guarantee and the warranty <eos> expires as soon as you stray <eos> and now you will not stay <eos> no matter if i should say <eos> that i hoped youd be the one i would hold <eos> as we laid and watched each other grow old <eos> now my love will be buried untold <eos> because i cant let it go would you call me if you can <eos> im waiting underneath it all <eos> all the mess and the chaos youve caused <eos> now youre nowhere to be found <eos> so tell me im trying to define <eos> the meaning of unconditional love <eos> when it puts you faced down on the ground <eos> youre out there sailing away <eos> and maybe a deadly storm will come and catch you <eos> lightning thunder will strike you <eos> it hits your head so hard youll come to me <eos> its all right i totally understand <eos> theyre greener on the other side <eos> and the sun will shine brighter everyday <eos> i guess thats where all the light goes <eos> and im ok i hope the best for you <eos> remember to go out and have fun <eos> you could spend the day out in the ocean <eos> i heard the waters fine over there <eos> i guess i ll learn to come by without you <eos> and somewhere out there im sure god is watching you close <eos> but then maybe his deadly storm will come and catch you <eos> lightning thunder will strike you <eos> it hits your head so hard youll come to me ill be on my way wait till you

while starring at your photograph <eos> im loosing my grip to reality <eos> i woke up turn on the tv for a thousand times <eos> reruns ive seen to many on the animal show <eos> the tiger runs after the dear and he finally catches on <eos> i see the end of the rainbow not far away <eos> this time im gonna let it slide as i walk to the end of the line <eos> i wonder if i should look back <eos> to all of the things that were said and done <eos> i think we should talk it over <eos> then i noticed the sign on your back <eos> it boldly says try to look away <eos> i go on pretending ill be ok <eos> this morning it hits me hard that <eos> still everyday i think about you <eos> i know for a fact thats not your problem <eos> but if you change your mind youll find me <eos> hanging on to the place <eos> where the big blue sky collapse <eos> as i stare at the wall in this room <eos> the cracks they resemble your shadow <eos> when everyday i see time goes by <eos> in my head everything stood still <eos> im waiting for things to unfreeze <eos> till you release me from the ice block <eos> its been floating for ages washed up by the sea <eos> and its drowning thought you should know that <eos> you see people are trying <eos> to find their way back home <eos> so ill find my way to you memilihmu perlu persiapan dan mental <eos> bagai memilih masuk ke sekolah unggulan <eos> memilihmu

felt all over our story beings on a sunday afternoon just between halfway tree and spanish town where a young boy not yet the cock othe walk that he would soon become was lying on the grass and taking in the sweet and sensuous scent of hibiscus that languidly lilted along the summer breeze it was at this precise moment that he saw her her walk was soft and delicate with a thaumaturgical touch that only a rabbiãâ¯ â¿ â½s daughter could have before their eyes had even met her luminous lips had already lured him in salvation winked with the promise of a bris held at pinnacle and a congregation of sages bunny hopping and chicken dancing to yiddish mento then their eyes linked an aeon blinked amharic vows were scryed upon their hearts just to think this could be with the frenectomy and a few words of love <eos> my shabop shalom baby wont you shabop shalom with me under the old banana tree <eos> my sweet telavivian lambs bread my heart can act as an emollient and youll never ever say "get

dentro di me un frastuono una musica <eos> che non so da dove viene e forse non ha un nome <eos> ma mi accarezza e mi invade <eos> quando sono con te sento dentro di me un frastuono una musica <eos> che non so da dove viene e forse non ha un nome <eos> ma mi accarezza e mi invade <eos> lestate ci picchia addosso e lalba ci illumina <eos> un colore una sfumature <eos> i tuoi capelli sul mio volto <eos> camminiamo insieme con un panino e da bere <eos> e tutte queste mutande come ti stanno bene <eos> e corre e corre e corre sotto i vestiti <eos> e urla e salta lascia che si avveri <eos> quando

always gonna be <eos> when i return to her arms and her eyes <eos> it might not be the same but its alright with me <eos> okay its alright with me some people are scared to see <eos> whats happening frequently but i would never shy from a fight <eos> heartbeat with a high demand often will go hand in hand <eos> but im sick of just starting plans i wanna spend the rest of my life <eos> when bernadette comes i get lost on her tide <eos> shes much too sweet and shes always gonna be <eos> when i return to her arms and her eyes <eos> it might not be the same but its alright with me whoa whoa whoa <eos> im going down to the basement yall <eos> where people all have a good time <eos> the parties that i hear have nothing to do with <eos> my ears are going out of my mind mind mind <eos> down here they play the real thing <eos> songs that were really rock and roll <eos> its a cliche to put it this way <eos> but they dont make em like that anymore more more more <eos> so if they put me in the spot light <eos> im never leaving the floor <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> cause i really want to rock and roll <eos> oh <eos> an old man gets on the mic <eos> tells us to hang our burdens up <eos> he says songs you hear today all start to get in the way <eos> till youre barely feeling the love love love love <eos> he drops the needle on a pop song <eos> he drops the needle on some soul <eos> and i watch a pimp fall in love over there <eos> dancing to songs their parents would know know know know <eos> so everybody give me room now <eos> watch me cut a rug in the show <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> im going down to the basement <eos> cause i really want to rock and roll <eos> oh <eos> party people sweat out the night <eos> let your body do just what it likes <eos> just want to hear some favorite before my years <eos> dance soldiers forgetting our day

summer go <eos> i was just hitting my stride <eos> its this insanity <eos> takes me along for the ride <eos> and i swam the oceans and the seven seas <eos> knowing that fate would strike eventually <eos> you gotta hit rock bottom if you wanna come out on top <eos> where did the winter go <eos> i just got used to the cold <eos> and its this maturity <eos> keeps me from getting too old <eos> and i saw a snow fall on a thousand towns <eos> with a sense of purpose i had just then found <eos> you gotta run real far before you ever feel close to home i love you from the bottom of my heart <eos> and thats not gonna change but things are grim <eos> when im watching you watch him <eos> i give you the best to give <eos> but im not feeling brave <eos> chances are slim <eos> when im watching you watch him <eos> oh oh what is there to learn <eos> when he will let you crash and burn <eos> he never gives attention <eos> but youre still <eos> where do i fit in <eos> when im watching you watch him <eos> god only knows why i still wait around <eos> except i hate to see you cry <eos> and i need you but there are things i cannot do <eos> and i want you when hes playing all his games <eos> and it gets hard to tell whos the victim <eos> and i am watching you watch him <eos> oh oh what is there to learn <eos> when he will let you crash and burn <eos> he never gives attention <eos> but youre still <eos> where do i fit in <eos> when im watching you watch him i cant write my words <eos> when i dont have you <eos> i cant sing my song <eos> when my strings wont tune <eos> you wont believe me <eos> you wont believe me crying <eos> i cant walk my path <eos> when i cant say motivated <eos> i cant play my part <eos> when it gets too complicated <eos> you wont believe me <eos> you wont believe me <eos> so youll never see me <eos> chorus <eos> give me a reason and i wont breakdown <eos> and if thats all that youve got <eos> youd better not get caught <eos> ive got more in store <eos> i cant keep my beat <eos> when i dont have you <eos> i cant shake my sins <eos> when you dont come through <eos> how could you leave me <eos> just when you see me crying <eos> and i cant feel low down <eos> when i dont have legs to stand on <eos> i cant feel low down <eos> when i there aint no ground to land on <eos> how could you leave me <eos> how could you leave me <eos> now youll never see me <eos> chorus <eos> dont look at me and act like youre just blind <eos> lets work it out before you change my mind <eos> chorus i give myself up every day <eos> to fight this woe is me demeanor <eos> if things had gone another way <eos> now would my grass be any greener <eos> and as im struggling on my own <eos> i have to think im not alone <eos> give and take we catch our breaks <eos> we all learn to survive <eos> oh but dont look now <eos> i said dont look now <eos> cause here we are <eos> living the best days of our lives <eos> these are the best days of our lives <eos> i fly around the world to spend <eos> my nights with strangers and their lovers <eos> i notice happiness depends <eos> on if we share it with each other <eos> so when this craziness is through <eos> ill spend my happiness with you <eos> give and take we catch our breaks <eos> we all learn to survive <eos> oh but dont look now <eos> i said dont look now <eos> cause here we are <eos> living the best days of our lives

<eos> because you got addicted from the first taste <eos> oh nobody wonders <eos> nobody really cares <eos> oh about your intentions <eos> until you gotten there <eos> when you started out you were just a blank space <eos> you started out you were just an ordinary face <eos> you started out now youve got to finish what youve done <eos> isnt that why you started in the first place <eos> started in the first place <eos> if you had ever believed <eos> that you were gonna break <eos> would you have gotten going in the first place <eos> all these decisions it takes <eos> to get you through the day <eos> with no one even noticing your heart break <eos> oh are you alone yes <eos> are you in trouble no <eos> oh peoples opinions <eos> they tend to come and go <eos> oo when you started out you were just a blank space <eos> you started out you were just an ordinary face <eos> you started out now youve got to finish what youve done <eos> isnt that why you started in the first place <eos> started in the first place <eos> how do you know <eos> when youre finally done <eos> if youve got nothing to show <eos> how do you know <eos> when all the people you might trust <eos> all forget to let you know <eos> oh <eos> oo when you started out you were just a blank space <eos> you started out you were just an ordinary face <eos> you started out now youve got to finish what youve done <eos> isnt the why you started in the first place <eos> started in the first place <eos> can you remember at the start <eos> can you remember trying your first shot <eos> can you remember wanting to be there <eos> can you remember wanting to be there <eos> do you know why you started in the first place <eos> do you know why you started in the first place <eos> in the first place <eos> started in the first place <eos> started in the first place talk is cheap and i should know <eos> ive given my everything and it wasnt close <eos> people mean well but still make a mess <eos> from now on im listening and saving my breath <eos> lately im losing my appetite <eos> for all the pretty young girls and the socialites <eos> who just talk <eos> and this is what we do we just talk <eos> watch em waste breath on a magazine <eos> or rehash what the television shows all mean <eos> its just talk <eos> and this is what we do we just talk <eos> some people dont know how they really feel <eos> some people wont talk about what is real <eos> and i could never chitchat all day long <eos> some people just look for an open ear <eos> some people dont care what you want to hear <eos> and everybodys talking while theyre stringing me along <eos> ill go by what you do <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> and i dont want to wait for you <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> i dont know how you spend your time <eos> but im done wasting all of mine <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> lately im tired of politics <eos> and listening to the never ending arguments <eos> that just stall <eos> and this is what we do we just stall <eos> never know someone to change their mind <eos> after a heated debate over the moral lines <eos> we just crossed <eos> but this is what we do we just talk <eos> some people get cute and they draw the line <eos> some people wont choose over left and right <eos> and i could never stomach all that greed <eos> some people dont care enough <eos> some people get scared enough <eos> to get talked into something that they think they should believe <eos> ill go by what you do <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> and i dont want to wait for you <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> i dont know how you spend your time <eos> but im done wasting all of mine <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> some people some people some people <eos> think action is overdue <eos> some people some people some people <eos> cant wait weve got work to do <eos> i only speak of what ive done <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> and if youre listening everyone <eos> but you talk when youre talking to me <eos> ill go by what to do <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> and i dont want to wait for you <eos> cause talk is cheap <eos> i dont know how you spend your time <eos> but im done wasting all of mine <eos> cause talk is cheap ive got a best friend who ive known some time <eos> and after all of these years ive got to read his mind <eos> and when he leaves the room i can feel him sigh <eos> as his thoughts they slip out like whispers <eos> who wouldve know itd be this hard to wait <eos> for one person to person to communicate <eos> and it never feels dramatic while we complicate <eos> thank god for old friends they always forgive us <eos> im longing for the house remembering all these days <eos> never done enough everything feels great <eos> if i am not myself then who am i pretending to be <eos> and i said how am i gonna get by <eos> without the help of the people i know <eos> for better or worse we all come together <eos> and they wont let me die alone <eos> i said they wont let me die alone <eos> and ive got a sister who i barely see <eos> despite the fact the lives right up the block from me <eos> and when we run into each other on the street <eos> its like two strangers soul to soul <eos> when i was younger she was younger too <eos> it seems the space is the only thing that really grew <eos> and now were both grown up and still without a clue <eos> thank god for family they always forgive us <eos> im thinking of the house where we were always raised <eos> in every family tree some history remains <eos> if i am not myself then who am i pretending to be <eos> and i said how am i gonna get by <eos> without the help of the people i know <eos> for better or worse we all come together <eos> and they wont let me die alone <eos> i said they wont let me die alone <eos> maybe im not supposed to be close <eos> to all of the people i need the most need the most <eos> and i said how am i gonna get by <eos> without the help of the people i know <eos> for better or worse we all come together <eos> and they wont let me die alone <eos> i said now how am i gonna get by <eos> when im afraid of the people i know <eos> for better or worse we all come together <eos> and they wont let me die alone <eos> i said they wont let me die alone <eos> i said they wont let me die alone <eos> i said they wont let me die alone im not cool <eos> and nobody would want me that way <eos> im just a regular guy <eos> in an insane world <eos> dont worry bout me <eos> ill be ok <eos> it was a picture perfect day <eos> i hit the freeway in la <eos> driving a car youd only see in a movie <eos> became my once and future self <eos> with all the style and the wealth <eos> surrounded by the people who wanna use me <eos> and then it came an epiphany <eos> from somewhere out of the car <eos> i never saw him crash into me <eos> but i know how i got home <eos> in a tow truck all alone <eos> now i know <eos> i went out drinking in new york <eos> with bottle service just for sport <eos> pretending i was living life like a hero <eos> flashing the labels on my clothes <eos> trying to keep up with the bros <eos> talking bout bank accounts and leaving off zeros <eos> and when that bill came i could not breathe <eos> never saw numbers that high <eos> so much for living in infamy <eos> acting flush was not that hard <eos> till i maxed out all my cards <eos> now i know <eos> cool people maybe theyre just born with it <eos> they know the trends before theyre here <eos> and im sick of trying cause theyre no denying <eos> thats theres nothing cool about my atmosphere one open book one witness stand <eos> a fresh start from a broken heart <eos> and well do the best we can <eos> hmm anyone who knows me <eos> knows you dont know me at all <eos> any love thats good comes easily <eos> and anyone who knows you <eos> has got his back against the wall <eos> but its alright to cry <eos> ask anyone who knows me <eos> he took your smile im something new <eos> sun shines in between the lines <eos> now youre stepping back in view <eos> hoo <eos> and anyone who knows me <eos> knows you dont know me at all <eos> any love thats good comes easily <eos> and anyone who knows you <eos> has got his back against the wall <eos> but its alright to cry <eos> ask anyone who knows me <eos> i said its alright to cry <eos> ask anyone who knows me <eos> anyone who knows you <eos> will tell you the hardest part <eos> is just keeping you around <eos> but anyone who knows me <eos> will tell you the coldest heart <eos> can eventually melt down <eos> and if youre gonna try <eos> said if youre gonna try

game every five months we act the same <eos> but i never get used to putting you off <eos> and no one couldve scripted this who knows whatll come of it <eos> i refuse to believe it was all just a waste <eos> chorus <eos> cause look around <eos> everybodys on the food chain <eos> funny but from day to day we get bottom to top <eos> and if you get lost you start over again <eos> but we dont ever get to no we dont ever get to stop <eos> i wake up in the oblivious state go to sleep trying to save some face <eos> cause ive never been one for acting naã¯ve <eos> and so what weve got nothing to prove <eos> why on earth would we soften the mood <eos> do we think that this wire is better left live <eos> i wouldve known better if i was on the outside <eos> i wouldve known better if i was on the outside <eos> looking in looking in <eos> but this chain just eats away at the people who use it <eos> no ones gonna say that its easier losing <eos> touch with who we need <eos> when its lonelier on the outside ive got a bone to pick with you and this opportunity <eos> i couldnt live this down enough to make up for you and me <eos> i feel a swelling in my soul ive been choking up inside <eos> id bite my tongue just for your sake but id swallow too much pride <eos> chorus <eos> and who will be sorry first who will be sorry first <eos> and if you wont be the one to budge i can tell what i am worth <eos> and youve got you to blame for what you do to you <eos> theres nothing shocking so it must be true <eos> and let me set this record straight on the drama you create <eos> before you go and turn your back on me <eos> ive got a lot to pay you back ive been saving up for years <eos> im gonna break you into two now whos gonna hear your tears <eos> ive been the friend you never had now youll never have me back <eos> i bear a witness to your faults and that lines severely cracked <eos> youre gonna live your life and stay on your side <eos> youre not ashamed to try youre more afraid of why <eos> this bridge is burning now its caving in <eos> were never gonna win well run in circles till we fall in line you dont have to believe me im just speaking my mind <eos> you look lovely as always you get that all the time <eos> you dont have to believe me when i tell you that im impressed <eos> but you sure better believe me when i say you deserve the best <eos> you dont have to believe me but im not gonna lie <eos> ive seen all the attention you get from other guys <eos> you dont have to believe me when i tell you i like your dress <eos> but you sure better believe me when i say you deserve respect <eos> chorus <eos> it feels like nobodys on your side no access to your pride <eos> you gotta learn to take control your whole body is a temple so <eos> youve got a choice to make and your mind is whats at stake <eos> so before we build this love please believe that youre good enough <eos> you dont have to believe me but im not often wrong <eos> theyve been taking advantage and its gone on too long <eos> you dont have to believe me when were dancing out on the floor <eos> but you sure better believe me when i say you are worth much more <eos> chorus <eos> you dont have to believe me <eos> but you sure better believe me when i tell you youre due for love <eos> i dont want nobody else <eos> and nobody else is gonna treat you the way they ought to <eos> and thats what you deserve <eos> if i could make you see it <eos> so you can truly believe it <eos> so you wont even need it <eos> you dont have to believe me when <eos> youre shaking what you got <eos> but you sure better believe me when <eos> i tell you your minds whats hot long as i am erasing this theres something i am bound to miss <eos> opportunities exist but often dont arise <eos> and think of how it must have felt to watch you walk away and melt <eos> i keep it all inside myself and in between my eyes <eos> and its no surprise what weve become <eos> since the arrival has begun <eos> it hasnt been long enough to even begin to think its alright <eos> im only concerned with the way we end up <eos> i think ive been wrong enough to know when im right <eos> so put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone <eos> it hasnt been long enough <eos> i feel as if i spoke too soon and ruined the whole afternoon <eos> a feeling that were more than doomed is creeping up inside <eos> and good as it was bound to be theres something about you and me <eos> its negative in chemistry which makes it hard to hide <eos> and its no surprise when lights are falling <eos> its bound to reawake some primal calling <eos> it hasnt been long enough to even begin to think its alright <eos> im only concerned with the way we end up <eos> i think ive been wrong enough to know when im right <eos> so put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone <eos> it hasnt been long enough i got arrested in the dark of the night <eos> the cop got restless as he read me my rights <eos> he told me "im always envious of those that i jail <eos> if i got locked up nobody come to help me post bail" <eos> and i said "oh" <eos> went to a party on the side of a hill <eos> met three latinas who had gotten their fill <eos> they told me "nobody ever gets us down on our knees <eos> simply to help us take a load off our feet" <eos> and i said "oh" <eos> and im never sure what im living for but its always on my mind <eos> someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine <eos> i picked a pocket just to give it all back <eos> took out the license left the money in tact <eos> the man said "i wanna thank you" and i had to ask why <eos> "that was the old me i was living a lie" <eos> and i said "oh" <eos> riding the subway with the scent of her hair <eos> she took out a toothbrush started using it there <eos> she explained "im always sure todays the day i will die <eos> i wanna look good if i get to look god in the eye" <eos> and i said "oh" <eos> and im never sure what im living for but its always on my mind <eos> someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine <eos> we get lost in the back of our minds <eos> got nothing to burn but time time time <eos> everybodys got the love but they keep it inside <eos> met an acquaintance we were reintroduced <eos> with more in common than we had in our youth <eos> she told me "you look the same" i said "im now a new man" <eos> she asked me "how does that work" "i started giving a damn" <eos> and i said "oh" new life decides to come through the front door <eos> and makes us wish wed shown respect before <eos> though i dont have much of a choice <eos> i resolve to regain my voice <eos> chorus <eos> if i only just begin to understand it thats because <eos> everytime i time i start to change my mind again <eos> it gets me back to where i was <eos> new life we never had a clue <eos> the two of us deciding what to do <eos> though my hands are all but tied <eos> i rebound so i can say at least i tried <eos> chorus <eos> and long as im allowed ill change my mind thats what its for <eos> im getting older but im still the same im just thinking anymore <eos> chorus okay its alright with me some things are just meant to be <eos> it never comes easily and when it does im already gone <eos> im practically never still more likely to move until i end up alone at will <eos> my life continues inching along <eos> when bernadette comes i get lost on her tide <eos> shes much too sweet and shes always gonna be <eos> when i return to her arms and her eyes <eos> it might not be the same but its alright with me <eos> okay its alright with me some people are scared to see <eos> whats happening frequently but i would never shy from a fight <eos> heartbeat with a high demand often will go hand in hand <eos> but im sick of just starting plans i wanna spend the rest of my life <eos> when bernadette comes i get lost on her tide <eos> shes much too sweet and shes always gonna be <eos> when i return to her arms and her eyes <eos> it might not be the same but its alright with me hes been waiting around for the weekend <eos> figuring which club to sneak in <eos> fancy drinks and fifty dollar cover charge <eos> lately its been a big hassle <eos> heineken and new castle <eos> to make sure hes fitting in and living large <eos> disregard the lies that he will tell and what hes probably like <eos> cause its not hard his charm is gonna get him through the night <eos> if he wants to rock he rocks <eos> if he wants to roll he rolls <eos> he can roll with the punches long as he feels like hes in control <eos> if he wants to stay he stays <eos> if he wants to go he goes <eos> he doesnt care how he gets there long as he gets somewhere he knows <eos> see her heavy makeup and cut tshirt <eos> every girl out wants to be her <eos> but they look the same already why adjust <eos> reading the magazine secrets <eos> forgetting the topical regrets <eos> cause if she comes home all alone the nights a bust <eos> its a must the swivel in her hips and the look she gives <eos> its all her trust if only in the morning she knew where she lived <eos> if she wants to rock she rocks <eos> if she wants to roll she rolls <eos> she can roll with the punches long as she feels like shes in control <eos> if she wants to stay she stays <eos> if she wants to go she goes <eos> she doesnt care how she gets there long as she gets somewhere she knows <eos> and in a wink theyre on the brink <eos> from drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow <eos> shot to shot its getting hot <eos> advance the plot to see how far its gonna go <eos> all depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab <eos> another chance at cheap romance <eos> doesnt count cause the room is spinning <eos> nothing to lose tonight they both are winning <eos> and they fall in love as they fall in bed <eos> if they want to rock they rocks <eos> if they want to roll they rolls <eos> they can roll with the punches long as they feels like theyre in control <eos> if they want to stay they stay <eos> if they want to go they go <eos> they dont care how they get there long as they get somewhere they know call me crazy if youve got it in you <eos> but these people dont seem to mind <eos> sweet vermouth now youre telling me the truth <eos> a little stubbornness will work out fine <eos> a bottom feeder at the end of my rope <eos> but im wondering where this rope began <eos> gonna circle around what i couldnt help bring down <eos> its just supply with demand <eos> nothing looks the same <eos> even when theres been no change <eos> say that somethings gonna give <eos> and its all giving out on you <eos> when its all over now <eos> its all over now <eos> its no longer fun and its all been overdone <eos> so its all over now <eos> a large pickup truck with a little cargo towed <eos> gets from bakers to the laundromat <eos> these daily fights all start to sound alike <eos> i guess im gonna have to live with that <eos> short changed <eos> now its getting even harder to identify the repetition <eos> short changed <eos> now its getting even harder to identify the repetition <eos> will i simply peel away <eos> feels more likely everyday <eos> say that somethings gonna give <eos> and its all giving out on you <eos> when its all over now <eos> its all over now <eos> its no longer fun and its all been overdone <eos> so its all over now <eos> and if you came here to tell me that youre sorry <eos> for the pain you couldnt cause <eos> then save your breath and use it <eos> just to regain what you have lost and look at the cost and now im trying to decide if i feel dirty at all <eos> cause it gets hard to tell <eos> its never just black and white shes got a mind of her own <eos> and she uses it well <eos> so she invites me over outside villanova <eos> shes got some pullout sofa that we wont hardly need <eos> she is only drinking soda revving up that motor <eos> got places we could go to but i still wont believe <eos> that shes only gifted <eos> when im standing by her side <eos> she goes unassisted <eos> and i start to relax as i cut her some slack <eos> chorus <eos> so get up i gotta go to work <eos> facing all these people who now know im a jerk <eos> and its a setup i gotta change my clothes <eos> concealing all this evidence before everybody knows <eos> what ive done and what im gonna do again <eos> and in the middle of the night i have a breakdown of sorts <eos> with regret creeping in <eos> shes gonna put up a fight and she will get her way <eos> cause she loves sleeping in <eos> so i need someone to side with when she begins confiding <eos> and i cannot provide it cause im endlessly cold <eos> she says shes so excited to play some groom and bride <eos> with me but im undecided so i need to be told <eos> that shes only sinking <eos> when im sleeping by her side <eos> with a change of thinking <eos> i could pull us away even just for a day <eos> chorus <eos> she grows impatient to change my tune <eos> shes geting older and legal soon <eos> and i wasnt ready to start out and go upsetting <eos> some girl that id be forgetting <eos> by the time the cops came by that afternoon <eos> and i try to decide as she pulls me aside <eos> chorus open my eyes and there you are <eos> out in the distance sun and the stars <eos> and i feel the way is going to be <eos> reach out let your heart go free <eos> this is just you and me <eos> ive been waiting for a love like you <eos> ive been waiting for a love like you <eos> ive been waiting for a love like you tonight <eos>

<eos> she wrote will you think of me when the sun goes down <eos> she wrote it wasnt anything i did <eos> to make her leave me all alone to raise both our kids <eos> said she cannot spend the night in that desert town <eos> cause she always thinks of me when the sun goes down <eos> so hard to know how long its gonna take <eos> to hear the heart that was never supposed to break <eos> she said to tell her mother hi for her <eos> and that she thinks of coming home but shes still not sure <eos> plays piano when she can <eos> but she hates the sound <eos> and she always thinks of me when sun goes down <eos> so hard to know how long its gonna take <eos> to hear the heart that was never supposed to break <eos> what a mistake <eos> i put that postcard in the fire tonight <eos> like all the others that she sends cuz they are all alike <eos> i closed the window and i pulled the shades all down <eos> im not gonna think of her when the sun goes down <eos> when the sun goes down <eos> when the sun

<eos> and nothing here will change at all <eos> until you find your way back to me again <eos> you always are the one you most abhors <eos> me and my tendency for the indoors <eos> but i know <eos> you always take the madness when you go <eos> so bring it home oh apricity i feel it in my bones <eos> as you left me standing burning in the cold <eos> with bioluminescence running through my veins

<eos> non mi sono rassegnato affatto come invece hai fatto tu <eos> chi lavrebbe messa in giro questa voce questo cuore debole <eos> che non sapeva neanche camminare ma voleva sempre vincere <eos> e si mangiava le unghie della vita e le lanciava sulle nuvole <eos> chi non muore si ripete chi non vuole non si vede piã¹ <eos> non mi sono rassegnato affatto come invece hai fatto tu <eos> chi non muore si ripete chi non vuole non si vede piã¹ <eos> non mi sono rassegnato affatto come invece hai fatto tu i got you in my sights <eos> and i intend to keep you there if thats alright <eos> the

find <eos> hell be there waiting <eos> for all of your life <eos> i could not ignore the call of the night <eos> to return to the haunt you would have me deny <eos> no i could never tell you where i had been <eos> for you could never answer them <eos> but theres a corner <eos> out amongst the white <eos> where someone is waiting <eos> for you to arrive <eos> and the one youre holding <eos> is not the one you left behind <eos> hell be there waiting <eos> for all of your life <eos> and though our coats are all at one with the snow <eos> i could not turn away from all i wish i did not know <eos>

<eos> as the curtains take their call <eos> and we slip through the seams through the inbetween <eos> of a truth and a lie of a god and a sky <eos> of a widow and bride of you and i <eos> so bury your weakness <eos> and chew the marrow from the bone <eos> keep yourself a secret <eos> from all of those whove always known <eos> its been revealing <eos> ignore your skin as it peels away <eos> its been revealing <eos> what you could never begin to explain <eos> theres the writing on our walls <eos> as the curtains take their call <eos> and we slip through the seams through the inbetween <eos> of a

forget <eos> my eyes are damp from the words you left <eos> ringing in my head when you broke my chest <eos> ringing in my head when you broke my chest <eos> and if youre in love then you are the lucky one <eos> cause most of us are bitter over someone <eos> setting fire to our insides for fun <eos> to distract our hearts from ever missing them <eos> but im forever missing him <eos> and you caused it <eos> and you caused it <eos> and you caused it by tomorrow well be swimming with the fishes <eos> leave our troubles in the sand <eos> and when the sun comes up <eos> well be nothing but dust <eos> just the outlines of our hands <eos> by tomorrow well be lost amongst the leaves <eos> in a wind that chills the skeletons of trees <eos> and when the moon it shines i will leave two lines <eos> just find my love then find me <eos> but dont bring tomorrow <eos> cause i already know <eos> ill lose you <eos> dont bring tomorrow <eos> cause i already know <eos> ill lose you <eos> ill lose you <eos> by tomorrow ill be left in the darkness <eos> amongst your cold sheets <eos> and your shoes will be gone <eos> and your body warmth no longer beside me i asked saint christopher <eos> to find your sister <eos> and she ran out in the woods <eos> and she ran out in the woods <eos> oh it was certain then <eos> and we were trying to stop the winter <eos> killing all it could <eos> killing all it could <eos> and i pray a lot for you <eos> and i look out for you <eos> we are what we are <eos> dont need no excuses <eos> for the scars <eos> from our mothers <eos> and we know what we know <eos> cause were made of all the little bones <eos> of our fathers <eos> and i pray a lot for you <eos> and i look out for you <eos> and i pray a lot for you <eos> and i look out for you <eos> i asked saint christopher <eos> to find your sister <eos> she ran out in the woods <eos> cause she ran out in the woods let the water rise <eos> let the ground crack <eos> let me fall inside <eos> lying on my back <eos> lying on my back <eos> dry your smokestung eyes <eos> so you can see the light <eos> youre staring at the sky <eos> watching stars collide <eos> watching stars collide <eos> if you leave <eos> when i go <eos> find me <eos> in the shallows <eos> when the time comes <eos> on the last day <eos> when they start to come down <eos> will you just <eos> will you run away <eos> will you run away <eos> and let it all rain down <eos> from the blood stained clouds <eos> come out come out to the sea my love <eos> and just <eos> drown with me <eos> drown with me <eos> if you leave <eos> when i go <eos> find me <eos> in the shallows <eos> lying on my back <eos> watching stars collide drifting apart like two sheets of ice my love <eos> frozen hearts growing colder with time <eos> theres no heat from our mouths <eos> please take me back to my rich youth <eos> and we were in flames i needed i needed you <eos> to run through my veins like disease <eos> and now we are strange strangers <eos> its different now <eos> gray faced <eos> eyes burnt out <eos> flames are gone <eos> gloves are on <eos> i have a feeling <eos> loves gone back <eos> went to the cinema losing our minds <eos> with comic fever shutting confined spaces <eos> lost in the dark my heart taken <eos> resting on your heart <eos> and we were in flames i needed i needed you <eos> to run through my veins like disease <eos> and now we are strange strangers <eos> wait for <eos> me to <eos> degrade before <eos> you go <eos> caring <eos> pray for <eos> waste of <eos> daylight <eos> speaks when <eos> sun burns keeping <eos> undeveloped <eos> out of revenge <eos> and degrading <eos> my youth and stained on our sheets <eos> its on a piece of me <eos> its on a piece of me <eos> winter comes <eos> winter crush all <eos> ive heard things that <eos> i once had from the beginning <eos> small lifeforms <eos> they can kill without warning <eos> so you dont explode <eos> stop you growing limbs and thinking <eos> that you love them now youre blinking <eos> and reminding her of him <eos> oh you steal his features <eos> and your mother is a bleacher <eos> she dont even feel the heat no <eos> she dont even want to speak to you <eos> but you youll always find another place to go <eos> oh you youll always find another womb to grow to grow to grow <eos> well you can try to sink down deeply <eos> and find the children lost at sea <eos> find the children who discretely <eos> were killed in infancy <eos> to stop them holding you and screaming <eos> that youll lose your wildest dreaming <eos> still reminding you of him <eos> how he left without reasons <eos> but you youll always find another place to go <eos> oh you youll always find another womb to grow to grow to grow <eos> you can try to forget me but i wont let you easily <eos> you can try to forget me but i wont let you easily <eos> im floating out in the water washed out to sea <eos> drifting away with time youll regret you conceived it <eos> clean up the dead you leave behind <eos> just like insects <eos> clean up the dead you leave behind skin up like lightning <eos> breathing flames from tourist trade <eos> your eyes go quite frightening <eos> you lock your gaze on to my face <eos> heavy eye crawling on the roadside <eos> swinging from the street lights <eos> i hope by the morning i will have grown back <eos> by the morning i will have grown back <eos> ill escape with him <eos> show him all my skin <eos> then ill go <eos> ill go home <eos> amsterdam <eos> im a flying kite in the breeze just <eos> restlessly seeking images a child needs to help them sleep <eos> i was thinking that i should see someone <eos> just to find out that im alright <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back <eos> ill escape with him <eos> showing all my skin <eos> then ill go <eos> ill go home <eos> amsterdam <eos> i used to dream of <eos> adventure <eos> when i was younger <eos> with lungs miniature <eos> good night with killing <eos> our brain cells <eos> is this called living <eos> or something else <eos> or something else <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back <eos> by the morning i wouldve grown back ill wrap up my bones <eos> and leave them <eos> out of this home <eos> out on the road <eos> two feet standing on a principle <eos> two hands longing for each others warmth <eos> cold smoke seeping out of colder throats <eos> darkness falling leaves nowhere to go <eos> its spiraling down <eos> biting words like a wolf howling <eos> hate is spitting out each others mouths <eos> but were still sleeping like were lovers <eos> still with feet touching <eos> still with eyes meeting <eos> still our hands match <eos> still with hearts beating <eos> still with feet touching <eos> still with eyes meeting <eos> still our hands match <eos> still with hearts beating <eos> still with feet touching <eos> still with eyes meeting <eos> still our hands match <eos> still with hearts beating <eos> two feet standing on a principle <eos> two hands digging in each others wounds <eos> cold smoke seeping out of colder throats <eos> darkness falling leaves nowhere to move <eos> its spiraling down <eos> biting words like a wolf howling <eos> hate is spitting out each others mouths <eos> but were still sleeping like were lovers <eos> still with feet touching <eos> still with eyes meeting <eos> still our hands match <eos> still with hearts beating <eos> still with feet touching <eos>

lay in the dark <eos> cause we got nothing to say <eos> just the beating of hearts like <eos> two drums in the grey <eos> i dont know what were doing <eos> i dont know what weve done <eos> but the fire is coming <eos> so i think we should run <eos> i think we should run run run run <eos> run run run run <eos> run run runrun <eos> while i put on my shoes <eos> he will button his coat <eos> and

<eos> its better she dont know <eos> and he wont tell his folks <eos> cause theyre already ghosts <eos> so well just keep each other <eos> as safe as we can <eos> until we reach the border <eos> until

meet my creators <eos> and they will all agree that im a suffocator <eos> i should go now quietly <eos> for my bones have found a place <eos> to lie down and sleep <eos> where all my layers can become reeds <eos> all my limbs can become trees <eos> all my children can become me <eos> what a mess i leave <eos> to follow <eos> in the darkness i will meet my creators <eos> they will all agree im a suffocator this is the end <eos> this is the end <eos> you wait to find that im still here <eos> and youve been waiting for the light to shine <eos> wake up wake up wake up <eos> ill be the answer to the question <eos> i cant answer its a question <eos> you cant spit it out can we find <eos> we find we find a way out a way out <eos> its easier to understand <eos> we die were buried underground

little boat that you made <eos> out of the evergreen that you helped your father cut away <eos> leave me on the tracks <eos> to wait until the morning train arrives <eos> dont you dare look back <eos>

cling to my frame <eos> wipe away your tear stains <eos> thought you said you didnt feel pain that boy take me away into the night <eos> out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest <eos> ill do whatever you say to me in the dark <eos> scared ill be torn apart by a wolf in mask <eos> of a familiar name on a birthday card <eos> blow out all the candles <eos> blow out all the candles <eos> "youre too old to be so shy" <eos> he says to me so i stay the night <eos> just a young heart confusing my mind <eos> but were both in silence <eos> wideeyed both in silence <eos> wideeyed like were in a crime scene <eos> well i have brittle bones it seems <eos> i bite my tongue and i torch my dreams <eos> have a little voice to speak with <eos> and a mind of thoughts and secrecy <eos> things cannot be reversed <eos> we learn from the times that we are cursed <eos> things cannot be reversed <eos> learn from the ones we fear the worst <eos> and learn from the ones we hate the most how to <eos> blow out all the candles <eos> blow out all the candles <eos> "youre too old to be so shy" <eos> he says to me so i stay the night <eos> just a young heart confusing my mind <eos> but were both in silence <eos> wideeyed both in silence <eos> wideeyed <eos> cause we both know <eos> ill never be your lover <eos> i only bring the heat <eos> company under cover <eos> filling space in your sheets <eos> well ill never be a lover <eos> i only bring the heat <eos> company under cover <eos> filling space in your sheets <eos> in your sheets <eos> so please just blow out all the candles <eos> blow out all the candles <eos> "youre too old to be so shy" <eos> he says to me so i stay the night <eos> its just a young heart confusing my mind <eos> but were both in silence <eos> wideeyed both in silence <eos> wideeyed like were in a crime scene let the water rise <eos> let the ground crack <eos> let me fall inside <eos> lying on my back <eos> lying on my back <eos> dry your smokestung eyes <eos> so you can see the light <eos> staring at the sky <eos> watching stars collide <eos> watching stars collide <eos> if you leave <eos> when i go <eos> youll find me <eos> in the shallows x <eos> when the time comes <eos> on the last day <eos> when they start to come down <eos> will you just <eos> will you run away <eos> will you run away <eos> let it all rain down <eos> from the blood stained clouds <eos> come out come out to the sea my love <eos> and just <eos> drown with me <eos> drown with me <eos> if you leave <eos> when i go <eos> youll find me <eos> in the shallows x <eos> lying on my back <eos> lying on my back <eos> watching stars collide i cant forget it though ive tried <eos> i know you regret it love <eos> you told me so many times <eos> but i still wonder <eos> why <eos> you left with her <eos> and left me behind <eos> take your hands off him <eos> cause hes the only one that i <eos> have ever loved <eos> and please dont find her skin <eos> when you turn the lights out <eos> i cant erase it <eos> from my mind <eos> i just replay it over <eos> think of it all the time <eos> but i dont want to imagine <eos> words you spoke to her that night <eos> naked bodies look like porcelain <eos> you both knew id be bleeding inside <eos> ooh ooh <eos> ah ah ah ah ah <eos> did she make your heart beat faster than i could <eos> did she give you what you hoped for <eos> oh nights of loveless love i hope it made you feel good <eos> knowing how much i adored you <eos> knowing how much i adored you you will grow all you need to grow inside my spine <eos> and then take what you need to take whats yours is mine <eos> and then just give all you want of it to some new thing <eos> ill stay here the provider of that constant sting they call love <eos> they call love <eos> you will drain all you need to drain out of me <eos> all the colors have washed away no more rosy sheen <eos> not just a pale isolated shallow water place <eos> oh what a place i call myself <eos> i call myself <eos> oh love all you need to love before it goes <eos> when your face becomes a strangers i dont know <eos> you will never remember who i was to you <eos> carried in the womb <eos> im called mother <eos> im called mother <eos> theyre called home <eos> theyre called home <eos> theyre called <eos> theyre called <eos> mothers <eos> mothers <eos> give all you need to give <eos> and sometimes they wont take what they need to take <eos> the strangest chemical reaction <eos> inside of her brain no shes not the same <eos> no shes not the same <eos> no shes not the same take the worst situations <eos> make a worse situation <eos> follow me home pretend you <eos> found somebody to mend you <eos> i feel numb <eos> i feel numb in this kingdom <eos> i feel numb <eos> i feel numb in

better off <eos> without temptation to regress to fake tenderness <eos> waiting to see someone we wont know for long <eos> in cities well only leave <eos> dont you think well be better off <eos> without the pressure to address <eos> a room of faces <eos> waiting to hear some strange women speak in tongues <eos> on lonely fridays of my loveless drunk baby <eos> loveless drunk baby <eos> i dont want to belong i dont want to belong <eos> i dont want to belong to you to anyone <eos> i dont want to belong i dont want to belong <eos> i dont want to belong to you to anyone <eos> i dont want to belong i dont want to belong no one asks me for dances because i only know how to flail <eos> i always hit like im drowning dead arms around him <eos> id rather stand still hold tightly to the walls <eos> no care no care in the world <eos> no care no care in the world <eos> i dont care i dont care anymore <eos> i dont care i dont care <eos> love you in a panic because i prefer to sit on fences <eos> spitkissing on my sickbed <eos> im not searching for replacements <eos> but we are like broken instruments <eos> twisted up and wheezing out the runnels <eos> sleepless folks watching light grow <eos> through their early morning windows <eos> i dont care i dont care anymore <eos> i dont care i dont care <eos> oh im too drunk to fight hurlings curses at your surface <eos> because im aware because it hurts that im in love again <eos> and you have kissed my neck so your arguments are insane <eos> fighting over the way something was said <eos> well im still here like a cheap threat <eos> no care no care in the world <eos> no care no care in the world <eos> i dont care i dont care anymore <eos> i dont care i dont care <eos> oh there has only been one time where we fucked <eos> and i felt like a bad memory <eos> like my spine was a reminder of her <eos> and you said that you felt sick <eos> i was so heavy hearted lying sideon with you afterwards <eos> how i wanted you to promise we would only make <eos> how i wanted you to promise we would only make <eos> how i wanted you to promise we would only make love <eos> but my mouth felt like i was choking broken glass <eos> so i just slept it off <eos> you see my mouth felt like it could talk the end of us <eos> so i just slept it off slept it off <eos> no care no care in the world <eos> no care no care <eos> i dont care i dont care anymore <eos> i dont care i dont care <eos> ah im too drunk to fight <eos> i only wanted you to promise me we would only ever make love <eos> but my mouth felt like i was choking broken glass <eos> so i just slept it off <eos> wanted you to promise me we would only ever make <eos> wanted you to promise me we would only ever make love i said too much said the wrong thing <eos> remembering the image i was trying to project to you <eos> cast an illusion think im losing my head <eos> sometimes i feel <eos> be what you want i can be what you want <eos> be what you want i can be what you want <eos> be what you want i can be what you want <eos> be what you want i can be what you want <eos> i dont know you now <eos> but im lying here somehow <eos> i feel sick <eos> im drowning in the pit of my stomach <eos> oh i know its my fault <eos> while youre busy diving down i find i feel fine <eos> feel a little out of my mind <eos> oh im stuck ive said too much <eos> im going much <eos> i can check and wait <eos> im waiting for some kind of response from you <eos> let me know <eos> i havent opened up <eos> the floodgates again to another man <eos> who controls the pain and never says anything <eos> anything <eos> anything <eos> i dont owe you much <eos> but i miss you such <eos> im missing you <eos> i feel sick <eos> im drowning in the pit of my stomach <eos> you dont know that im caught <eos> thinking you remind me of someone i cant face no more <eos> ive gotta get him out of my mind <eos> while youre busy diving down <eos> i find that feeling <eos> i feel alone <eos> ive gotta get him out of mind <eos> while youre busy diving down <eos> i find that feeling <eos> i feel alone <eos> i feel alone and theyre making children <eos> and theyre making love <eos> with their old excuses <eos> we are built for reproduction <eos> but i find it soothing <eos> when i am confined <eos> im just fearing one day soon <eos> ill lose my mind <eos> then ill lose my children <eos> then ill lose my love <eos> then ill sit in silence <eos> let the pictures soak <eos> out of televisions <eos> float across the room <eos> whisper into one ear <eos> and out the other one <eos> then ill take my clothes off <eos> and ill walk around <eos> because its so nice outside <eos> and i like the way the sun feels <eos> and when its dark <eos> ill call out in the night for my mother <eos> but she isnt coming back for me <eos> cause shes already gone <eos> but you will not tell me that <eos> cause you know it hurts me every time you say it <eos> and you know youre doing the right thing <eos> you must know youre doing the right thing <eos> i have lost my children <eos> i have lost my love <eos> i just sit in silence <eos> let the pictures soak <eos> out of televisions <eos> out of televisions <eos> out of televisions <eos> out of televisions <eos> out of televisions i hate sleeping alone <eos> terrified with the lights out <eos> i hate living alone <eos> talking to myself is boring conversation <eos> me and i are not friends <eos> she is only an acquaintance <eos> i hate dreaming of being alone <eos> cause you are never there <eos> just a shadowy figure with a blank face <eos> kicking me out of his place <eos> i hate walking alone <eos> i should get a dog or something <eos> i hate eating alone <eos> i hate eating alone <eos> i hate sleeping with you <eos> cause you are never there <eos> just a shadowy figure with a blank face <eos> kicking me out of his place <eos> i hate living with you <eos> i should get a dog or something <eos> i hate walking with you <eos> talking to myself is boring conversation <eos> you and i were once friends <eos> now youre only an acquaintance <eos> i hate dreaming of being with you <eos> i hate dreaming of being with you <eos> i hate dreaming of being with you <eos> terrified with the lights out <eos> terrified with the lights out moving on <eos> just moving in slow motion <eos> to keep the pain to a minimal <eos> weightless only wait for a fall <eos> how long must i wait for you <eos> i dance in the evening <eos> how long must i wait for you <eos> to become what i need <eos> holding on to veneers <eos> his words end from birthdays <eos> goodbye to our emptiness <eos> yeah thats when i saw her <eos> hold me back <eos> hold me back <eos> all i am <eos> all i am <eos> how long <eos> before the last dance <eos> how come hes the one <eos> to let me down <eos> how can the light glows <eos> different in the evening <eos> how can the stars <eos> distance into daylight what if im made of stone <eos> feeling is not a system <eos> nervous and cold in your home <eos> hoping im over thinking <eos> i should be feeling more <eos> draped over your bones <eos> paint colors up the walls <eos> to spread our inspirations <eos> you are the likely cause <eos> of what will be mine <eos> tonight <eos> oh its not surprising <eos> just inconvenient <eos> to play no part in <eos> all of the instruments <eos> seem to be sounding out <eos> its premature <eos> i think im made of stone <eos> i should be feeling more <eos> love <eos> its just face painting <eos> love <eos> its just easing awaiting <eos> before <eos> dying without company worst i bring <eos> i have a dirty mind <eos> oh i need i need new ways <eos> to waste my time <eos> i need new ways <eos> worst i bring <eos> i live alone alone alone <eos> worst i face <eos> keep me inside i need new ways <eos> to waste my time <eos> i need i need new ways <eos> im trying to get out <eos> find a subtle way out <eos> not just cross myself out <eos>

want more <eos> oh this is how we are fighting <eos> this is how we are fighting <eos> time <eos> time <eos> well i didnt come here <eos> looking for a soul <eos> and im tired of watching dust <eos> collecting on a bowl <eos> im a spirit trying to be human <eos> im just a spirit trying to be human <eos> but im thinking this is how we are fighting <eos> this is how we are fighting <eos> time <eos> time <eos> you hold on to yourself <eos> youre afraid that you might <eos> get left behind <eos> and so you hide your eyes <eos> youre afraid that the light <eos> will make you blind <eos> but its time <eos> its time to shine <eos> yes its time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> and you dont need strength to be strong <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> no you dont need strength to be strong <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe in what you know <eos> time to believe before you go feel im on the verge of some greath truth <eos> where im finally in my place <eos> but im fumbling still for proof <eos> and its cluttering my space <eos> casting shadows on my face <eos> i know i have the strength to move a hill <eos> but i can hardly leave my room <eos> so ill sit here perfecty still <eos> and ill listen for a tune <eos> when the mind is on the moon <eos> and if i stumble <eos> and if i stall <eos> and if i slip now <eos> and if i should fall <eos> and if i cant be all that i could be <eos> will you will you wait for me <eos> cause everywhere i seem to be <eos> i am only passing through <eos> i dream these days about the sea <eos> always wake up feeling blue <eos> wishing i could dream of you <eos> so if i stumble <eos> and if i fall <eos> and if i slip now <eos> and loose it all <eos> and if i cant be all that i could be <eos> will you will you wait for me when do you really get to go

woke me <eos> slow pain i feel <eos> will not let me be <eos> so much work to do <eos> i dont know if i can <eos> trying so hard so hard so hard <eos> but im just one man <eos> five years old i climbed up on the wall <eos> my mother warned me but i took no heed <eos> like all creatures great and small <eos> i took a fall and found out i could bleed <eos> these days im afraid of everything <eos> suppose cause everything will die <eos> thought it was to love what they will lose <eos> so much easier to lie <eos> sometimes i fell like im drowning <eos> actually its more like most of the time <eos> but every now and then when im sleeping <eos> i still have a dream that im flying <eos> and i wake up crying martin was bright as he stood up and sang in the choir <eos> his heart all in pieces was breaking his head was on fire <eos> they took him from that place and they buried him deep in the ground <eos> out with the light and quiet the sound <eos> and its a slow revolution that quietly turns <eos> as the true word burns <eos> and all of the people marching together out cross the floor <eos> and all that was after is now as it was before <eos> now sylvia sat staring out in the depths of a room <eos> a moment of light from her brain cut through the dark and pierced the gloom <eos> childrens voices were music came faint through the wall <eos> from such a great height she looked down it was only the fall <eos> and its a slow revolution that quietly turns <eos> as the true word burns <eos> and all of the people marching stomping out cross the floor <eos> and all that was after is now as it was before <eos> so look at the shadows bent forward trying to break through the night <eos> huddled against the darkness so close to the light <eos> my voice is breaking out here in this wilderness <eos> for i see a time that is coming i see a time of change <eos> the sun is burning the deserts but waters filling the plains <eos> noah is crazily chipping away at his ark <eos> while all of us ready ourselves to go into the dark <eos> and its a slow revolution that quietly turns <eos> as the true word burns <eos> and all of the people marching dancing out cross the floor <eos> and all of this matter soon wont matter much anymore it was cold you had your hands inside your sleeves <eos> as we walked i heard the laughter in the leaves <eos> see the shadows lying now where once we stood <eos> and i would lie down right there if only i could <eos> the music came to me it came across the sound <eos> and you laughed and shown and danced a circle around <eos> as we walked away i saw a shadow on the ground <eos> there were stones inside my pockets that i found <eos> when i was younger i heard angels on the roof <eos> as thousand voices singing each one was the truth <eos> well a wise young lad i left them in my youth <eos> and i have only just my memory for proof <eos> see a doorway open on a darker road <eos> out in the garden thread lies broken on the loom <eos> see a face thats smiling quick around the wall <eos> and in the distance mountains waiting for the fall <eos> see these knots around my hands around my feet <eos> they would take me down my end for me to meet <eos> i grow weary of this struggle and this fight <eos> the mornings so far off from out here in the night <eos> the night is cold and you must leave me this i know <eos> and empty all the places where we used to go <eos> before i knew you i went climbing in the snow <eos> called your name out to the darkness down below i see my brother he is walking in the sun <eos> his back is bare he carries no burden for anyone <eos> i see the island the silver line <eos> brother how you shine <eos> and all around the light <eos> and all around the light <eos> now i see my father hes so small against the sky <eos> the child the tree the shadows on his eyes <eos> he doesnt know who hes supposed to be <eos> father you are free <eos> and all around the light <eos> and all around the light <eos> now my mother she is crying on the stairs <eos> her hands are leaves the light is in her hair <eos> as she prays she thinks that no one heard <eos> mother you are a bird <eos> mother you are a bird <eos> and all around the light <eos> and all around the light <eos> and all around the light <eos> all around the light see the clouds are creeping <eos> towards the sun <eos> im drifting away <eos> unseen by anyone <eos> the light is turning gray <eos> the day is done <eos> the water is cold <eos> and heavy on my mind <eos> i dreamed of walking with you <eos> but i fell behind <eos> looking for a rose <eos> i could not find <eos> now the ice is stirring <eos> and spring is near <eos> there is no one calling <eos> but the sound is clear <eos> though im not yet gone <eos> im still not here i love my father and i love him well <eos> i hope to see him someday soon <eos> i love my father and i love him well <eos> i hope to see him someday soon <eos> cause where i live it gets dark at night <eos> the kind of dark eats up the light <eos> yeah where i live it gets dark at night <eos> the kind of dark eats up the light <eos> and you know that mother id be lying <eos> if i didnt tell you im afraid of night <eos> and as i dream im falling down <eos> the world moves without a sound <eos> im lost as sure as i was found <eos> the sun comes up without a sound <eos> so i up and

questions on my mind lately <eos> like will i find a love that lasts long as my life <eos> or will i die before ever becoming a wife <eos> and im wondering if im even the marrying kind <eos> how can i give you my life when i know youre just gonna die <eos> is there anything stronger than biology <eos> is love being ruined by technology <eos> nowadays commitment seems like a burden to carry <eos> i dont wanna think about it <eos> i dont wanna i dont wanna <eos> think about it think about it <eos> i dont wanna i dont wanna <eos> think about it think about it <eos> i dont wanna i dont wanna <eos> think about it think about it <eos> i dont wanna think about it <eos> its too scary <eos> and the closest i can come to being really free <eos> is letting my lover perform experiments on me <eos> observe and analyse <eos> and empirically hypothesise <eos> cos i wanna know real love so desperately <eos> but i think its gotta happen scientifically <eos> cos im scared <eos> afraid of real intimacy <eos> you know the kind they say happens psychologically <eos> dressed up like a surgeon you could open my heart <eos> remove the brain and leave the body in charge <eos> no more emotions taking control <eos> we will pick a part and play out our roles <eos> further than fantasy deeper than love could ever be <eos> further than fantasy deeper than love could ever be <eos> and the only best friends <eos> i ever made <eos> were people i knew i didnt have to see every day <eos> the closest to true love <eos> i ever came <eos> was with someone i kept many miles away <eos> cos im wary of eliminating distance <eos> this could surely be the death of <eos> any romance <eos> cos im shitty and im lame and im dumb and im a bore <eos> and once you get to know me you wont love me anymore <eos> and that possibility worries me the most <eos> not harm or abuse or becoming a ghost <eos> its the closeness the intimacy <eos> im afraid it might kill me i got a mind of my own <eos> and i know its a good one <eos> so i dont take advice from fools <eos> i get around in my town <eos> i go wherever i want <eos> got a reason for all that i do <eos> dont wanna be scared <eos> ive gotta see whats out there <eos> lately ive become aware <eos> that i can do whatever i want <eos> whatever i want ooohh <eos> i can do whatever i want <eos> whatever i want ooohh <eos> i can do whatever i want <eos>

<eos> whispering tall trees all around you hear <eos> what do you fear <eos> a doorway through cobwebs and blackberry vines <eos> that brings forth and tends another <eos> beginning a time of land and sky <eos> of learning to walk as a mother <eos> learning to walk as a mother <eos> the first time of birthtime a primal time <eos> is made for a quiet land <eos> to be held by a house waiting to hold <eos> a family by the hand <eos> lets sweep out the cobwebs pull back the vines <eos> growing through the place entwined <eos> bring forth children its our duty <eos> to wake up this sleeping beauty

different waves in the big big sea <eos> a million different dreams lie ahead of me <eos> but as i lay out on the kitchen floor <eos> theres a million different stories banging at my door <eos> but the only one i want is the one with you <eos> you make me electric on the avenue <eos> chorus <eos> but youre miles away miles away <eos> and i dont ever want to see you surrender <eos> and i never want to say goodbye <eos> cause the last thing i remember <eos> is the tear falling from your eye <eos> and youve looked to the burning sky <eos> into the bright through the burning sky <eos> the way she moves is like a rolling scene <eos> shes got more love than she will ever need <eos> shes like a midnight bolt of electricity <eos> and when she asked she said do we need <eos> have little more time tomorrow my mind <eos> but whats inside is just a waste of time <eos> oceans may break the walls youve on your shore <eos> rivers might change the shape of your fall <eos> chorus <eos> but youre miles away miles away <eos> and i dont ever want to see you surrender <eos> and i never want to say goodbye <eos> cause the last thing i remember <eos> is the tear falling from your eye <eos> and youve looked to the burning sky <eos> into the bright through the burning sky the rolling ocean takes a breath <eos> from the shoreline i feel blessed <eos> take me north bound back to home <eos>

milwaukee off your feet <eos> and at once i knew i was not magnificent <eos> strayed above the highway aisle <eos> jagged vacance thick with ice <eos> and i could see for miles miles miles <eos> third and lake it burnt away the hallway <eos> was where we learned to celebrate <eos> automatic bought the years youd talk for me <eos> that night you played me lip parade <eos> not the needle nor the thread the lost decree <eos> saying nothing thats enough for me <eos> and at once i knew i was not magnificent <eos> huddled far from the highway aisle <eos> jagged vacance thick with ice <eos> and i could see for miles miles miles <eos> christmas night it clutched the light the hallow bright <eos> above my brother i and tangled spines <eos> we smoked the screen to make it what it was to be <eos> now to know it in my memory <eos> and at once i knew i was not magnificent <eos> high above the highway aisle <eos> jagged vacance thick with ice <eos> but i could see for miles miles miles fall in

in hinnom <eos> all this time <eos> with your heart in mind <eos> didnt you edit <eos> in hinnom <eos> go the least <eos> and the precious feast <eos> the invetted <eos> sand it starts to steal <eos>

pennant tension ring <eos> armor down <eos> on the wettest ground <eos> not to vet it errant heat to the star <eos> and the rain let in <eos> the hawser rolls the vessels whole and christ its thin <eos> well id know that youd offer <eos> would reveal it though its soft and flat <eos> wont repeat it cull and coffers that <eos> for the soffit hang this homeward <eos> pry it open with your love <eos> sending lost and alone standing offers <eos> it is steep it is stone <eos> such recovery <eos> from the daily press the deepest nest in keepers keep <eos> all the news at the door <eos> such a revelry <eos> well its hocked inside of everything you said to me <eos> it was found what we orphaned <eos> didnt mention it would serve us picked <eos> said your love is known <eos> im standing up on

long minutes end and it was over itd all be back <eos> and the frost took up the eyes <eos> pressed against the pane could see the veins and there was poison out <eos> resting in a raze the inner claims i hadnt breadth to shake <eos> searching for an inner clout may not take another bout <eos> honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain <eos> hon it wasnt yet the spring <eos> aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out <eos> nose up in the globes you never know if you are passing out <eos> no it wasnt maidenup the falling or the faded luck <eos> hung up in the ivory both were climbing for a finer cause <eos> love can hardly leave the room <eos> with your heart for the love id fallen on <eos> in the swampy august dawn <eos> what a mischief you would bring young darling <eos> when the onus is not all your own <eos> when youre up for it before youve grown <eos> from the faun forever gone <eos> in the towers of your honeycomb <eos> id a tore your hair out just to climb back darling <eos> when youre filling out your only form <eos> can you tell that its just ceremon <eos> now youve added up to what youre from <eos> build your tether rainout from your fragments <eos> break the sailors table on your sacrum <eos> fuck the fiercest fables im with hagen <eos> for the love comes the burning young <eos> from the liver sweating through your tongue <eos> well youre standing on my sternum dont you climb down darling <eos> oh the sermons are the first to rest <eos> smoke on sundays when youre drunk and dressed <eos> out the hollows where the swallow nests come on skinny love just last the year <eos> pour a little salt we were never here <eos> my my my my my my my my <eos> staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer <eos> i tell my love to wreck it all <eos> cut out all the ropes and let me fall <eos> my my my my my my my my <eos> right in the moment this orders tall <eos> and i told you to be patient <eos> and i told you to be fine <eos> and i told you to be balanced <eos> and i told you to be kind <eos> and in the morning ill be with you <eos> but it will be a different kind <eos> and ill be holding all the tickets <eos> and youll be owning all the fines <eos> come on skinny love what happened here <eos> suckle on the hope in light brassieres <eos> my my my my my my my my <eos> sullen load is full so slow on the split <eos> and i told you to be patient <eos> and i told you to be fine <eos> and i told you to be balanced <eos> and i told you to be kind <eos> and now all your love is wasted <eos> and then who the hell was i <eos> and im breaking at the britches <eos> and at the end of all your lines <eos> who will love you <eos> who will fight <eos> who will fall far behind sold my cold knot <eos> a heavy stone <eos> sold my red horse for a venture home <eos> to vanish on the bow <eos> settling slow <eos> fit it all fit it in the doldrums <eos> or so the story goes <eos> color the era <eos> film its historical <eos> my mile could not <eos> pump the plumb <eos> in my arbor till my ardor <eos> trumped every inner inertia <eos> lump sum <eos> all at once <eos> rushing from the subpump <eos> or so the story goes <eos> balance we wont know <eos> we will see when it gets warm someday my pain someday my pain <eos> will mark you <eos> harness your blame harness your blame <eos> and walk through <eos> with the wild wolves around you <eos> in the morning ill call you <eos> send it farther on <eos> solace my game solace my game <eos> it stars you <eos> swing wide your crane swing wide your crane <eos> and run me through <eos> and the storys all over you <eos> in the morning ill call you <eos> cant you find a clue when your eyes are all painted sinatra blue this my excavation and to <eos> day is qumran <eos> everything that happens is from now on <eos> this is pouring rain <eos> this is paralyzed <eos> i keep throwing it down two <eos> hundred at a time <eos> its hard to find it when you knew it <eos> when your moneys gone <eos> and youre drunk as hell <eos> on your back with your racks as he stacks your load <eos> in the back with the racks and he stacks your load <eos> in the back with the racks and youre unstacking your load <eos> ive been twisting to the sun <eos> i needed to replace <eos> and the fountain in the front yard is rusted out <eos> all my love was down <eos> in a frozen ground <eos> theres a black crow sitting across from me <eos> his wiry legs are crossed <eos> hes dangling my keys he even fakes a toss <eos> whatever could it be <eos> that has brought me to this loss <eos> on your back with your racks as he stacks your load <eos> in the back with the racks and he stacks your load <eos> in the back with the racks and youre unstacking your load <eos> this is not the sound of a new man <eos> or a crispy realization <eos> its the sound of me unlocking and you lift away <eos> your love will be <eos> safe with me bike down down to the downtown <eos> down to the lock down boards nails lie around <eos> i crouch like a crow <eos> contrasting the snow <eos> for the agony id rather know <eos> cause blinded i am blindsided <eos> peek in into the peer in <eos> im not really like this im probably plightless <eos> i cup the window <eos> im crippled and slow <eos> for the agony <eos> id rather know <eos> cause blinded i am blindsided <eos> would you really rush out for me now <eos> taught line down to the shoreline <eos> the end of a blood line the moon is a cold light <eos> theres a pull to the flow <eos> my feet melt the snow <eos> for the irony id rather know <eos> cause blinded i was blindsided <eos> cause blinded i was blindsided <eos> cause blinded i was blindsided so abruptly <eos> saw death on a sunny snow <eos> for every life <eos> forgoe the parable <eos> seek the light <eos> my knees are cold <eos> running home running home <eos> running home running home <eos> go find another lover <eos> to bring a to string

courtesy in love with love and lousy poetry and im leaning on a broken fence between past and present tense and im losing all these stupid games that i swore id never play and it almost feels okay

head <eos> to see whats happening gonna take more teeth <eos> than those in your mouth to chew it all down <eos> gonna take more brains than the brains that you have in your skull <eos> to find the answers cause these days information stinks <eos> there are enough lies here to fool the sphinx <eos> the newest version of the oldest trick <eos> its been working since they wrote that book <eos> and you say that it makes you sick <eos> but not before that it made you look <eos> gonna take more words than the words that can roll off your tongue <eos> to express that there is a way better than this to be free <eos> gonna take more hands than the hands that grown on your arms <eos> to chip away the tired veneer <eos> its thick as a myth <eos> you dont know what youre messing with <eos> the newest version of the oldest trick <eos> its been working since they wrote that book <eos> and you say that it makes you sick <eos> but not before that it made you look <eos> oh well it started so long ago with <eos> just a few rich men they <eos> wanted to protect what they had but the <eos> problem with freedom is <eos> everyone wants some and <eos> if all are equal then the poor might get mad <eos> so they found enemies built up mythologies <eos> to keep the people from snooping around <eos> it worked so well we can no longer tell <eos> where the truth turns to dust who to kill who to trust <eos> the newest version of the oldest trick <eos> its been working since they wrote that book <eos> and you say that it makes you sick <eos> but not before that it made you look if you see a magpie remember the rhyme <eos> one for sorrow and two for joy <eos> three for a girl and four for a boy <eos> five for silver and six for gold <eos> seven for a secret never to be told <eos> wear a spider round your neck in a walnut shell <eos> keep a folded newspaper in your shoe <eos> stick the pages up with wallpaper glue <eos> the devil has to read every word <eos> before he can get to you ive heard <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> get to heaven so the devil knows youre dead <eos> dont you let the robin in keep the white moth out <eos> see the seventh son of the seventh son <eos> if you need healing well hes the one <eos> it never bodes well to see a dog cry <eos> you dreamed of snow now your parents are gonna die <eos> if she doesnt drop the scissors then shes been true <eos> but dont part ways on a bridge my friend <eos> cause youll never see each other again <eos> and if you catch a sparrow on valentines day <eos> youll marry poor but be happy anyway <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> get to heaven so the devil knows youre dead <eos> throw the windows up move the birdcage out <eos> if the doors are locked his soul cant leave <eos> take all the buttons off his sleeve <eos> sew up his pockets and close his eyes <eos> if you lived a good life therell be flowers on your grave <eos> and theyll keep one half of your comb <eos> but dont ever try to follow them home <eos> cause they dont want you there no more at all <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> may your soul get to heaven <eos> get to heaven so the devil knows youre dead so i find myself here again <eos> i have to wonder if its ever going to end <eos> i once knew this place by a different name <eos> i guess i shouldnt be surprised <eos> had i thought i would have recognized <eos> cause the faces are different but it feels the same <eos> so please be patient with me baby <eos> ill try to make this the last time <eos> but im a hard way learner <eos> i keep my finger to the burner <eos> and i need my time to get it right <eos> im a hard way learner <eos> for a while everything is fine <eos> like ive left it all for behind <eos> but theres a rip in the cloth where the past crawls through <eos> and it comes in a new disguise <eos> to try to look me right in the eyes <eos> and ask again what are you going to do <eos> so please be patient with me baby <eos> ill try to make this the last time <eos> but im a hard way learner <eos> i keep my finger to the burner <eos> and i need my time to get it right <eos> im a hard way learner <eos> and the flags go up <eos> the alarm bells ring <eos> but im blinded i dont hear a thing <eos> so push that rock sisyphus up the hill <eos> will it roll back yeah it probably will <eos> but you dont have to keep pushing till you come undone <eos> and they talk about a wheel to which were bound <eos> to ride forever as it goes around <eos> and if you dont get it in this life <eos> you try the next one <eos> so please be patient with me baby <eos> i want to make this the last time <eos> but im a hard way learner <eos> i keep my finger to the burner <eos> and i need my time to get it right <eos> im a hard way learner no flights out of paris <eos> the new years almost here <eos> the old ones on its last legsand i may disappear <eos> cause lately ive been thinking <eos> youre going the wrong way <eos> going the wrong way <eos> youre not where you expected <eos> the dreams you collected <eos> might cost more than you can pay <eos> and i almost fell on saint michel <eos> till i found what i forgot <eos> a year can change a lot <eos> there is no language to catch the beauty <eos> of the moon over montparnasse <eos> and i cant explain for the life of me <eos> how this could come to pass <eos> that a family was torn <eos> and your first child born <eos> all the people that weve become <eos> ive given up predicting <eos> its leaving me conflicted <eos> and wondering where it all comes from <eos> why a friend was lost <eos> and another one found <eos> some lessons they cant be taught <eos> but a year can change a lot <eos> a year can change a lot <eos> youre worried about the end <eos> but youre missing all the plot <eos> one moment you are freezing <eos> and the next red hot <eos> and a year can change a lot <eos> oh well it looks like ill leave on standby <eos> this airport is like a heart <eos> and it pumps me out with a million souls <eos> to make a brand new start <eos> and wars will rage <eos> then turn the page <eos> and fortunes will rise and fall <eos> the old ones will leave <eos> and i do believe <eos> that ill surrender to it all <eos> cause the bestlaid plans <eos> unfold like fans <eos> then snap tight on the spot <eos> and a year can change a lot <eos> another orbit around the big star <eos> guess ill give it another shot <eos> cause a year can change a lot this house <eos> called us on the other coast <eos> it knew that wed become a ghost <eos> it said as far as it could tell <eos> we should come out and stay a spell <eos> and it took us in with open arms <eos> high above the lights and car alarms <eos> of the carnival that cant be killed <eos> this house upon the hill <eos> this house <eos> sends me to the streets below <eos> to go and play another show <eos> but it loves it when we come home fine <eos> to drink another bottle of wine <eos> and it makes our bed upon the porch <eos> under starlights silver torch <eos> and it stays up when i cant sleep <eos> cause it knows ive got a plan to keep <eos> this house <eos> is going to take the fall for me <eos> while i walk away free <eos> the house <eos> has seen it all done before <eos> had a hundred people through its door <eos> and it knows were not getting young <eos> but it wants our song to be sung <eos> and its sad that weve got to go <eos> though i told it well be back i know <eos> and i hope it will be standing still <eos> this house upon the hill well you disappeared this morning <eos> and youve been gone <eos> for the good part of the day <eos> with your invisible radio crackling <eos> and those eyes that say stay away <eos> and where you go is a mystery <eos> cause your body never leaves <eos> its onl your expression that turns strange <eos> when you get out of range <eos> there are rivers raging below these streets <eos> and mountains growing underneath the sea <eos> when you hear hidden decibels <eos> you ask does it happen much to me <eos> then you beg me to come find you <eos> and pull you back to ground <eos> tether you to something that wont change <eos> when you get out of range <eos> when you come back to the moment <eos> and the water settles clear <eos> then we can both be citizens of nowhere <eos> nowhere else but here <eos> and then gravity will cradle you <eos> call on your return <eos> and never give you reason to exchange <eos> when you get out of range your message said youd be okay <eos> i hate it when you lie to me <eos> but i am just too far away <eos> to help much to calm your sea <eos> the hanging judge is at your door <eos> the serpents underneath your bed <eos> you summon all your angels out <eos> they tell you its in your head <eos> and this may hurt for just a while <eos> but it always comes out right <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight <eos> when all the secret codes you know <eos> cant seem to unlock the door <eos> and all the road that led you home <eos> dont arrive there anymore <eos> dont scare yourself by thinking that <eos> youve lose your only light <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight <eos> when all the pretty temples you built <eos> make you want to tear them down <eos> youre crying over milk you spilled <eos> long before it hit the ground <eos> pull your mad genie back inside <eos> and screw the lid on tight <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight <eos> go easy go easy on yourself tonight the last time i saw you you were lying on a bed <eos> with bracelets on your wrist and a hole through your head <eos> your eyes open looking straight at me <eos> as if you still had something to see <eos> the last time i saw you you were running for your life <eos> no child in your arms and no sign of your wife <eos> your mouth open in the strangest way <eos> like youre searching for the words to say <eos> take these wobbly bones <eos> break them with stones <eos> here is my skin it keeps it all in <eos> far under my clothes <eos> the blood still flows <eos> to ten fingers and ten toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> count them on your ten fingers and toes <eos> the last time i saw you you were buried in the sand <eos> a crater in the place where your home used to stand <eos> your arms twisted reaching up to the sky <eos> asking for the answer why <eos> and the last time i saw you all the soldiers had arrived <eos> they lined you up along with the rest that survived <eos> you dropped to your knees and you started to pray <eos> never stopping when they dragged you away <eos> take these wobbly bones <eos> break them with stones <eos> here is my skin it keeps it all in <eos> far under my clothes <eos> the blood still flows <eos> to ten fingers and ten toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> count them on your ten fingers and toes <eos> the last time i saw you you were nowhere to be seen <eos> they painted the walls scrubbed the floor squeaky clean <eos> i havent seen you since i wont see you for sure <eos> cause no ones going to knock on your door <eos> and you dont have a name anymore <eos> and no ones going to knock on your door <eos> cause you dont have a name anymore <eos> take these wobbly bones <eos> break them with stones <eos> here is my skin it keeps it all in <eos> far under my clothes <eos> the blood still flows <eos> to ten fingers and ten toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> ten fingers and toes <eos> count them on your ten fingers and toes youve never known where your place is <eos> among faces and how do you do <eos> the planets made you divided <eos> they decided to split you in two <eos> so you tried many disguises <eos> shapes and sizes to fit yourself in <eos> but each one left you wearing strange clothes <eos> now when the wind blows you start to spin <eos> cause when it comes down <eos> it really comes down <eos> so you feel like a pauper in a palace <eos> a pretender to the throne <eos> feel like youre a prince in a poorhouse <eos> and youve never been so alone <eos> everyones running from something <eos> probably the one thing they need the most <eos> and its there if you think you deserve to <eos> but you prefer to remain a ghost <eos> cause if you decide <eos> you have to decide <eos> so you feel like a pauper in a palace <eos> a pretender to the throne <eos> feel like youre a prince in a poorhouse <eos> and youve never been so alone <eos> youve got love in your heart <eos> and theres something youre supposed to do <eos> but youre throwing the fight <eos> cause youre scared of what might be true <eos> your seat is set at the table <eos> if youre able to let yourself stay <eos> and the world is patiently waiting <eos> for you to get out of your way <eos> so you feel like a pauper in a palace <eos> a pretender to the throne <eos> feel like youre a prince in a poorhouse <eos> and youve never been so alone <eos> lately youre a stranger to your own self <eos> though youve known it all along <eos> if there is nowhere that you fit in <eos> maybe you are already where you belong on the day that i was born they say i came out wearing these same clothes <eos> and since then ive been trying to find out where i got these same clothes <eos> i went to every store asked every tailor there could be <eos> wondering if somebody had the same clothes as me <eos> and it took a while but i learned theres nobody with these same clothes <eos> and when i wake this morning ill get up put on these same clothes <eos> and ill step into the sunlight and start walking in these same clothes <eos> and when the air turns cold and the clouds bring the rain <eos> these clothes they will protect me till the skies clear up again <eos> and against the wind ill button up the collar on these same clothes <eos> and when we first met im sure that i was showing off these same clothes <eos> and when i gave my heart to you i did so in these same clothes <eos> and before we first made love you pealed off each one from my skin <eos> till there was nothing left to keep you from coming in <eos> and you saw who i am in the absence of these same clothes <eos> when they get dirty i wash them with care oh these same clothes <eos> and when they lose a button oh they tear in these same clothes <eos> now most days when i dwell on not what is but what is not <eos> i look at other people and all the clothes theyve got <eos> until i realize i could have nothing but these same clothes <eos> and our children will know what it means to have a loving home <eos> but there are things they will have to figure out on their own <eos> and i promise i wont ever try to make them wear these same clothes <eos> no no <eos> ohh ooo ooh <eos> ohh ooo ooh <eos> oooh ohh do do do <eos> when i leave this world please separate me from these same clothes <eos> just burn them into ash no one can ever wear these same clothes <eos> and if you knew me well you know how much i cherished you <eos> remember that i wore these clothes the only way i knew <eos> and i was happy and i was blessed and how i loved to wear these same clothes <eos> yes i was happy and i was blessed and how i loved to wear these same clothes <eos> yeah i was happy and i was blessed and how i loved to wear these same clothes <eos> alright oooh ooh ooh <eos> alright oooh ooh ooh <eos> oooh ooh do do do <eos> oooh ooh ooh ooh do do do flowers bloom when love is born <eos> two hearts collide <eos> if you ever feel a thorn <eos> ill be there by your side <eos> nothing will ever hurt you <eos> ill keep you safe <eos> two hearts one soul <eos> this love is forever <eos> two hands will hold <eos> this love together <eos> one part of life is love <eos> love love love <eos> love love forever love <eos> save your kisses for the one

from the start <eos> we laid long in the tall grass we loved for the joy of love itself <eos> we threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else <eos> and we wished for nothing else <eos> and through the crossbeams whispers were heard undoing in every line <eos> and in the fall you flew little bird but ill see you when its time <eos> we laid long in the tall grass we loved for the joy of love itself <eos> we threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else <eos> and we wished for nothing else <eos> we laid long in the tall grass we loved for the joy of love itself <eos> we suffered heartache after heartache but we wished for nothing else <eos> we wished for nothing else naked from the fee <eos> from the decade of the bees <eos> on a new road <eos> with no true know that see it <eos> theres doubt in every face <eos> theres a liar on the stage <eos> and what good is it <eos> if you dont hear him say of believing <eos> every clap brings out a warning

us <eos> and so down <eos> down down and so plain <eos> so down <eos> when you play some more it seems so <eos> and my friends are past this game <eos> of breakdowns <eos> and our friends that are lost at sea <eos> throw down <eos> and ill break the wasted space <eos> slow down slow down <eos> if you dont slow down slow down <eos> if you dont slow down slow <eos> cut the bonds with the moon <eos> and watch the dogs gather i dont know you <eos> but i want you <eos> all the more for that <eos> words fall through me <eos> and always fool me <eos> and i cant react <eos> and games that never amount <eos> to more than theyre meant <eos> will play themselves out <eos> take this sinking boat and point it home <eos> weve still got time <eos> raise your hopeful voice you have a choice <eos> youll make it now <eos> falling slowly eyes that know me <eos> and i cant go back <eos> moods that take me and erase me <eos> and im painted black <eos> you have suffered enough <eos> and warred with yourself <eos> its time that you won <eos> take this sinking boat and point it home <eos> weve still got time <eos> raise your hopeful voice you have a choice <eos> youll make it now are you sleeping <eos> still dreaming <eos> still drifting off alone <eos> im not leaving with this feeling <eos> so youd better best be told <eos> and how in the world did you come <eos> to be such a lazy love <eos> its so simple and fitting <eos> the path that you are on <eos> were not talking theres no secrets <eos> theres just a note that you have gone <eos> and all that youve ever owned <eos> is packed in the hall to go <eos> and how am i supposed to live without you <eos> a wrong word said in anger and you were gone <eos> im not listening for signals <eos> its all dust now on the shelf <eos> are you still working still counting <eos> still buried in yourself <eos> and how in the world did we come <eos> to have such an absent love <eos> and how am i supposed to live without you <eos> a wrong word said in anger and you were gone <eos> and how am i supposed to live without anyone <eos> and how in the world did you come <eos> to be such a lazy love <eos> and where did you go drown out the voice that breaks the silence <eos> and talks the joy out of everything <eos> you were found out and had to walk <eos> in darkness without the only thing you care about <eos> and we drive away and head for south <eos> we found our way and blocked it out <eos> cry alone and die alone <eos> pray alone and stay alone <eos> you were burned out <eos> and had to stop before all hell broke <eos> and finally took its toll <eos> and save our souls were playing dead <eos> and mine for gold in a heart of lead <eos> and turn around and save yourself <eos> we found our way and blocked it out <eos> cry alone and die alone <eos> pray alone and stay alone <eos> drown out drown out i think its time we give it up <eos> and figure out whats stopping us <eos> from breathing easy and talking straight <eos> the way is clear if youre ready now <eos> the volunteer is slowing down <eos> and taking time to save himself <eos> the little cracks they escalated <eos> before we knew it was too late <eos> for making circles and telling lies <eos> youre moving too fast for me <eos> and i cant keep up with you <eos> baby if you slow down for me <eos> i could see youre only telling lies lies lies <eos> breaking us down with your lies lies lies <eos> when will you learn <eos> the little cracks they escalated <eos> and before we knew it was too late <eos> for making circles and telling lies <eos> youre moving too fast for me <eos> and i cant keep up with you <eos> maybe if youd slow down for me <eos> i could see youre only telling lies lies lies <eos> breaking us down with your lies lies lies <eos> when will you learn <eos> so plant the thought and watch it grow <eos> wind it up and let it go we made a plan that was subject to change <eos> so whatever was it works out we both get the blame <eos> in the arms of this low <eos> and you took the wind right out of my sails <eos> by sweating me out on all the little details <eos> in the arms of this low <eos> in the arms of this low <eos> so thread the light <eos> so thread the light <eos> we made a choice and we knew we would pay <eos> for stealing the joy and trying to escape <eos> from the arms of this low <eos> and if by some chance you break from the pack <eos> you know ill be waiting to welcome you back <eos> into the arms of this low <eos> in the arms of this low <eos> thread the light <eos> thread the light <eos> thread the light <eos> thread the light <eos> shine the light <eos> dont hide the light <eos> live the light <eos> and give the light <eos> seek the light <eos> and speak the light <eos> crave the light and brave the light <eos> stare the light <eos> and share the light <eos> show the light <eos> and know the light <eos> raise the light <eos> and praise the light <eos> thread the light <eos> and spread the light i will understand you <eos> i will serve you well <eos> ill suffer when you leave me <eos> stand out in parallel <eos> and i will recognize you <eos> when youre lost to yourself <eos> just to be the one <eos> you call in <eos> i will raise an army <eos> i will gather strength <eos> ill follow where you lead me <eos> ill go through anything <eos> and i will heed your warning <eos> and sound your victory bell <eos> just to be the one <eos> you call in <eos> and for the first time <eos> you were dark <eos> caught out on a western swell <eos> swept apart <eos> and we watched as their <eos> bodies danced <eos> towards the rocks <eos> to the rocks <eos> i will recognize you <eos> when youre lost to yourself <eos> just to be the one <eos> you call in <eos> just to be the one <eos> you call in where you

bellies raw <eos> and to all the good samaritans <eos> whoever found us in the dark <eos> and to all whove been <eos> or come between <eos> the lovers in the park <eos> and to all the ã dã­omasaigh

<eos> oh broken hearted hoover fixer sucker guy <eos> oh broken hearted hoover fixer sucker sucker guy <eos> one day ill go there and win her once again <eos> but until then im just a sucker of a guy scratching at the surface now <eos> and im trying hard to work it out <eos> and so much has gone misunderstood <eos> and this mystery only leads to doubt <eos> and i didnt understand <eos> when you reached down to take my hand <eos> and if you have something to say <eos> you better say it now <eos> cause this is what youve waited for <eos> a chance to even up the score <eos> and as these shadows fall on me now <eos> i will somehow yeah <eos> cause im picking up the message lord <eos> and im closer than ive ever been before <eos> so if you have something to say <eos> say it to me now just say it to me now now <eos> oh oh oh you must have fallen from the sky <eos> you must have shattered on the wrong way <eos> you brought so many to the light <eos> and now youre by yourself <eos> there comes a point in every fight <eos> where giving up seems like the only way <eos> when everyone has said goodbye <eos> and now youre on your own <eos> if you need somewhere to fall apart <eos> somewhere to fall apart <eos> when the rules of cain the rights you made <eos> the hours did crawl for those to blame <eos> the broken glass the fool that asked <eos> the moving arrow to stop <eos> you must have fallen from the sky <eos> you must have come here in the pouring rain <eos> you took so many through the light <eos> and now youre on your own <eos> if you need somewhere to fall apart <eos> somewhere to fall apart <eos> well the ruins of man the bloody rag <eos> neither fool the bull the powdered hag <eos> the nights they make the rattle rag <eos> the wolves that follow the outed man <eos> the falling star the way we are divine <eos> the rules that never ever multiply <eos> you must have fallen from the sky <eos> you must have come here on the wrong way <eos> you came among us every time <eos> but now youre on your own <eos> if you need somewhere to fall apart <eos> somewhere to fall apart <eos> well they call you saint the basket case <eos> the rules of thumb you have to break <eos> the raging skull the rag to the bull <eos> the nails that drag in either hand <eos> well i will make my work of that <eos> i know this place i know this task <eos> you must have fallen from the sky throw the body in the lake <eos> and take a chance that no one finds out <eos> your life is stories that you fake <eos> and rake like leaves behind you <eos> so row the boat into the bay <eos> and say youve lost your compass <eos> your life is pieces that you play <eos> and maybe they will trump us <eos> blow the kiss you never felt <eos> and belt your wife for smiling <eos> love is lying by yourself <eos> alone awake and crying <eos> honey <eos> even if you knew <eos> even if you knew <eos> even if you knew <eos> what lies what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> sew the ribbon round your throat <eos> and coat your mouth with honey <eos> your life is books you never wrote <eos> and tote only for money <eos> dig a hole into the ground <eos> and pound the earth in outrage <eos> your life is treasures that youve found <eos> and drowned in lakes that youve made <eos> show the soul you never had <eos> a fad that will not save you <eos> your life is hiding all the bad <eos> and sad smiles that break you <eos> honey <eos> even if you knew <eos> even if you knew <eos> even if you knew <eos> what lies what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> honey if you took back all the promises and rings <eos> and little things and when he sings would you still <eos> know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> movies that you make and you hit stop and you hit play <eos> and the scenes are day by day would you still know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> comb through all facts to learn his words are rather <eos> heady <eos> says hes ready to go steady would you still know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> pies that you will bake when you are sittin in the <eos> kitchen <eos> are you listenin to what your missing would you still <eos> know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> be the first to crack when your new love must be <eos> measured <eos> under pressure under pleasure would you still know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> suckle on the lack of all the hugs you never got <eos> and if you rot its what you bought would you still <eos> know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> dew lies on the haystack you were tied and you were <eos> tethered <eos> like a feather in stormy weather would you still know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon <eos> be the first to crack when your new love must be <eos> measured <eos> under pressure under pleasure would you still know <eos> what lies behind that honeymoon playing checkers in the greatest hall <eos> made math and science school a little less not fun at all <eos> studying all night for dr kishs quiz <eos> at least you never caught yersinia pestis <eos> lan parties after lights out <eos> some got mad when we competed for the longest shout <eos> suspended for a week when i propped a door <eos> so we drove to shawnee to get some tips from rushmore <eos> it was looking pretty bleak would they let us stay <eos> but did we really want imprisonment anyway <eos> still im pretty glad they let us back in <eos> you were a pretty shoddy roommate but id do it again <eos> dont ever take for granted what youre given <eos> mathew when they found you they had found you finding jesus as well <eos> the poison had caught you in its spell <eos> did nobody bother you to tell <eos> the catholics would banish you to <eos> well they should know that youre in <eos> a better part of hell <eos> making fun of tyler and aaron for being so fat <eos> and how laura was such a brat <eos> doublecut punch right across the chin <eos> boxing during study time once and again <eos> and with a couple old foils wed find and then <eos> party in the dark to aphex twin <eos> always kind of an ass always making us laugh <eos> i used to like looking into the past <eos> now youre out of line now youre out of time <eos> forever asshole <eos> did you really think you had it the worst of all <eos> you had everything you ever needed <eos> except another head a little less conceited <eos> forget about the ones that once you needed <eos> matthew when they found you they had found you finding jesus as well <eos> the poison had caught you in its spell <eos> did nobody bother you to tell <eos> the catholics would banish you to <eos> well they should know that youre in <eos> a better part of hell <eos> than the darkness whence you fell before <eos> matt when they found you they had found that youd found christ where <eos> you lay <eos> he gave you the strength to live they say <eos> i think he gave you the strength to pass away <eos> he made you believe it was okay <eos> to produce all the pain and blame <eos> anchors away <eos> five hundred yesterdays <eos> before you took your breath away <eos> not a lot to say <eos> nothing much to do <eos> there is a part of you <eos> in every of the ones you knew <eos> one of whom forever blue <eos> i only wish you knew <eos> that the gun that failed to fire beforehand <eos> tried to tell you nothing new i just saw you in your apartment <eos> you just took a shower <eos> you smelled like your old shampoo <eos> i threw out all those memories <eos> all those things that remind me <eos> now im standing here before you <eos> what would you say if i still adored you <eos> i told myself i would never talk to you <eos> i told myself i would never reach out to you <eos> falling asleep on the subway <eos> coughing on the f train out to brooklyn <eos> i wonder where the homeless go when it rains <eos> all these faces arent worth looking i wonder why <eos> i bought a ticket to this game <eos> can you give me a glass of water <eos> do you have some medicine <eos> you still have that picture of him <eos> has it really been four years <eos> breakfast at the place you thinks great <eos> is this all the life you know <eos> are we friends or on a date <eos> im cold my health is feather <eos> whether its up to you im cold my health is feather whether i reach out to you <eos> falling asleep on the subway <eos> coughing on the f train out to brooklyn <eos> i wonder where the homeless go when it rains <eos> calling all my peeps on sunday <eos> texting on the f train out to brooklyn <eos> wonder why i get no service explain <eos> all these faces arent worth looking <eos> i wonder why i bought a ticket to this game <eos> girl why cant i forget you love <eos> is a disease <eos> it infects what you believe about yourself and the others you need <eos> and love is not kind it wont smile and it wont shine <eos> it isnt there when you need it <eos> you cant save it and you cant delete it <eos> and love is cruel and unforgiving <eos> and love is usually unwilling to give you back what youve been building <eos> it will scorch the earth just cause youre tilling it <eos> and like a cat that youve been petting for every day of every single week <eos> but when you need it and youre feeling weak <eos> all it really wants to do is fall asleep <eos> because love is vicious and love is spiteful but also love also just doesnt care <eos> so you can fight it <eos> but when you strike at it <eos> it will just vanish like it was never there <eos> but believe me its still there <eos> not in your shoes or heart or hair <eos> cause ive looked in all the obvious places and still havent found it anywhere <eos> but when i find it i will kill it <eos> so that i can get on with my life <eos> and regain composure of my posture and control of the thoughts in my own mind <eos> because love will break you apart <eos> but now hate is accessible and <eos> jealousy is free <eos> bitterness is easy and blame comes even easier for me and lust is a game that you will always will lose <eos> but who minds losing when each level has new contestants for you to choose <eos> and you can yell out "okay im finished <eos> now i wanna win" <eos> well too bad cause winnings not up to you <eos> all you can do is choose when to begin <eos> to start losing something different <eos> shaped vaguely like pride <eos> but much bigger and much heavier and much much easier to find <eos> and once you give that away you will know <eos> by the sickness in your stomach and the numbness in your toes <eos> because love will break you apart <eos> and love will break you apart <eos> and love will break you apart <eos> love is hard amy can you blame me for asking you <eos> more about your man in his sharkskin boots <eos> stay in your hotel room and not his place <eos> pretend the mascaras not running down your face <eos> if you stare <eos> if you stare into the sun for too long <eos> you could believe you could have been someone <eos> for anyone all along <eos> if you read your leaves from just the right angle <eos> you could make believe <eos> love cant be wrong <eos> amy can you paint me a portrait of love <eos> can you tell a story with creatures made of <eos> goodness and affection compromise <eos> instead of superstition doubt and lies <eos> if you stare <eos> if you stare into the sun for too long <eos> you could believe you could have been someone <eos> for anyone all along <eos> if you read your leaves from just the right angle <eos> you could make believe <eos> love cant be wrong <eos> amy <eos> whats right for you <eos> is right for <eos> amy <eos> whats right for you <eos> is right you see <eos> amy can you play me a song i dont know <eos> fill it with your voice so soft and low <eos> i can listen with my ear against the floor <eos> float upon the waves and washed to shore <eos> if you stare <eos> if you stare into the sun for too long <eos> you could believe you could have been someone <eos> for anyone all along <eos> if you read your leaves from just the right angle <eos> you could make believe <eos> love cant be wrong <eos> if you stare <eos> if you stare into the sun for too long <eos> you could believe you could have been someone <eos> for anyone all along <eos> if you read your leaves from just the right angle <eos> you could make believe <eos> love cant be wrong the sea beneath the cliff <eos> is the blue in my mothers eyes <eos> that came from the blue in her mothers eyes <eos> thrown on down the line <eos> by our family who worked the field <eos> on borrowed land above the ocean <eos> my family worked the field on borrowed land <eos> higher hills do not provide <eos> for hearts born of coral and moss <eos> where rain wont flow beyond our stream <eos> and water is captive to the well <eos> there was a gentleman <eos> ive always known his childrens songs <eos> blue eyes were hardened by the war <eos> but still he went on singing <eos> night cant hide a man <eos> when his eyes are tearing <eos> the night cant hide his cries <eos> theres only a few of us left <eos> higher hills do not provide <eos> for hearts born of coral and moss <eos> where rain wont flow beyond our stream <eos> and water is captive to the well <eos> ive known that age old blue <eos> lies in home with sirens tombs <eos> hes left a deep desire <eos> for a home beside the water <eos> shady rhythm calms the night <eos> and that voice is never still <eos> you know a voice is never still <eos> and a voice is never silent <eos> shady rhythm calms the night <eos> and that voice is never still <eos> you know a voice is never still <eos> and a voice is never silent <eos> higher hills do not provide <eos> for hearts born of coral and moss <eos> where rain wont flow beyond our stream <eos> and water is captive to the well i can hear the elders whispering in words so sweet and low <eos> the alder trees were listening to songs been sung before <eos> my friend and i collecting skeletons of leaves <eos> making tiny piles oh and sifting through the weeds <eos> wind blows the tiny green tiny green <eos> wind blows the tiny green helicopter seeds <eos> wind blows the tiny green tiny green <eos> wind blows the tiny green helicopter seeds <eos> oh wandering in days unfolding <eos> with hats fashioned of mud and snake skin <eos> oh wandering in days unfolding <eos> with hats fashioned of mud and snake skin <eos> of mud and snake skin <eos> as i think about the ladies who werent allowed to sing <eos> sewing all their pretty rows of thread instead of singing <eos> and what about the black braided sisters of mariee <eos> we sat upon their grinding rock as children used to be <eos> beneath the knotted pine knotted pine <eos> beneath the knotted pine at the gardens edge <eos> beneath the knotted pine knotted pine <eos> beneath the knotted pine at the gardens edge <eos> oh laughing little girls clapping <eos> ghosts weaving our hair to baskets <eos> oh laughing little girls clapping <eos> and ghosts weaving our hair to baskets <eos> our hair to baskets <eos> i can hear the elders whispering in words so sweet and low <eos> the alder trees were listening to songs been sung before <eos> my friend and i collecting skeletons of leaves <eos> making tiny piles oh and sifting through the weeds <eos> making tiny piles oh and sifting through the weeds when the day when the day falls to the light <eos> at the end oh the end of my time <eos> i call to the dark take the bones off my back <eos> and i chant to the black you were my lady divine <eos> cause my children are in hiding <eos> mortor and pestle they grind <eos> those songs whistled through white teeth do scuff the days <eos> with songs for children to sing <eos> those songs whistled through white teeth do scuff the days <eos> with songs for children to sing <eos> when the chairs are tucked into the fading song <eos> and the silver of their pours has grown long <eos> oh they call to the dark take the bones off my back <eos> and they chant to the black you were my lady divine <eos> and they bloat like a bitter wine in their bellies <eos> cause the bones have been removed <eos> from their hunched over backs <eos> and their children are all grown now <eos> mortor and pestle they grind <eos> those songs whistled through white teeth still scuff the days <eos> with songs for children to sing <eos> those songs whistled through white teeth still scuff the days <eos> with songs for children to sing <eos> those songs for children to sing she was always walking singing to her footsteps <eos> dirt ditch paths and pine cones digging up glass bottles <eos> rusty springs from feather beds old hubcaps on the picket fence <eos> she planted beds of flowers stayed outside for hours <eos> in spirit shes drifted to the ocean <eos> all those years of waiting for the water <eos> shes watching long shadows caught in the tide <eos> but the sunset by the sea is in her mind <eos> the sunset by the sea is in her mind <eos> and she was always hoping to someday leave the mountain <eos> domestic chores and children the darkness of the winter <eos> painting all these mermaids wandering to the sea shore <eos> she wanted him to follow but his heart is with the hillside <eos> in spirit shes drifted to the ocean <eos> all those years of waiting for the water <eos> shes watching long shadows caught in the tide <eos> but the sunset by the sea is in her mind <eos> the sunset by the sea is in her mind ive known mornings white as diamonds <eos> silent from a night so cold <eos> such a stillness calm as the owl glides <eos> our lives are buried in snow oh oh <eos> i was sifting through the piles <eos> in my hand a tangled thread <eos> each patient tug upon the snarl <eos> is a glimpse of what has been oh oh <eos> burdened bands gain strong hands <eos> gaping holes where diamonds should be <eos> must have been the morning that stole them <eos> a glint of white in the pocket of winter oh oh <eos> and some hearts are ghosts settling down in dark waters <eos> just as silt grows heavy and drowns with the stones <eos> some hearts are ghosts settling down in dark waters <eos> just as silt grows heavy and drowns with the stones oh oh have you been wearing holes in your boots out there <eos> have you been kicking bones in the desert sand <eos> theres a wolf inside the cave and another in the clouds <eos> ive seen them chewing on on the shadows in your eyes <eos> and its here at home i wait for your wanders to be still <eos> oh its here at home i

<eos> all alone all alone all alone there are things that ive seen in my head while im sleeping in bed <eos> they do not wither in the morning light <eos> im taken back oh im taken back to the dry grass and the shadows <eos> thinking id like to look at your teeth lined up in perfect rows <eos> a maze of children feeding orchard trees <eos> where the flat lands stretch inside your mouth <eos> and when you laugh all the star thistles stumble out <eos> the flat lands stretch inside your mouth <eos> and when you laugh all the starthistles stumble out <eos> strong spines of valley hills all overgrown in gold <eos> look softer than a spool of old silk thread <eos> but if we walked down with our feet <eos> id be pulling spines and barbs and fox tails from your skin <eos> oh if we walked down with our feet <eos> id be pulling spines and barbs and fox tails from your skin <eos> there are things that ive seen in my head while im sleeping in bed <eos> they do not wither in the morning light <eos> im taken back oh im taken back to the dry grass and the shadows <eos> im taken back oh im taken back to the dry grass and the shadows all the back roads all the highways <eos> distance countries that ive passed through <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> down by the river by the light of the moon <eos> i feel the echo of your current in my core as i roam <eos> as i roam as i roam as i roam as i roam <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> when im around i want you near <eos> handsome fellow will you hold me dear <eos> ive seen blue eyes and straight white teeth <eos> golden minds and sturdy feet <eos> but every path has lead me back to you <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> down by the river by the light of the moon <eos> i feel the echo of your current in my core as i roam <eos> as i roam as i roam as i roam as i roam <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> every path has lead me back to you <eos> put your hand upon my breast <eos> my little darlin i know of restlessness <eos> my little darlin i know of restlessness the tops of crags and cliffs the air is thin <eos> so well find a mountain path on down the hill <eos> meet me where the snow melt flows <eos> it is there my dear where we will begin again <eos> skipping stones braiding hair <eos> last years antlers mark the trail <eos> take us back oh take us back <eos> oh take us take us back take us back oh take us back oh take us take us back <eos> ive a friend who lives out by the rivers mouth <eos> he knows the fiddles cry is an old sound <eos> a lonesome of creeks and moans of empty houses <eos> are songs like fallen rain <eos> windblown buildings muddy ground <eos> the strength of water can sink a man <eos> take us back oh take us back <eos> oh take us take us back take us back oh take us back oh take us take us back in time all clear <eos> im alone with the thought of it <eos> high outside <eos> its there and its gone again <eos> counting it fast and keeping it slowly <eos> time all clear <eos> im alone with the thought of it <eos> when we see you <eos> we believe it in the end <eos> all things go <eos> when i see it <eos> i believe it in the end <eos> all things go <eos> oh some things get lost <eos> get lost and go missing <eos> wandering off in time <eos> counting too fast <eos> keeping things slowly <eos> slowly in time <eos> when i see it <eos> i believe it in the end <eos> all things go <eos> when we see them <eos> we will believe them in the end <eos> all things go late at night in the basement <eos> singing along hoping for some magic <eos> who knows what powers left in the words we sing to each other <eos> who knows <eos> stretch it out the invisible like parking tickets on the dash of the car <eos> leave them one by one <eos> the flags waving up on the vane <eos> desperate measures different minds <eos> if we fall together they see me cry <eos> nothing can hold them at least not tonight <eos> i know theres power left in the way we sing to each other <eos> becalm the darkened room for im the funeral singer <eos> fold back the visual like lenses focused on the light at the end <eos> leave them one by one <eos> the flags waving up on the vane <eos> desperate measures different plans <eos> if we fall together they see me cry <eos> nothing can hold them at least not tonight congratulate my friends <eos> on the birth of a healthy son <eos> take him quietly and hold him in my arms <eos> it will seem so violent <eos> crying on each others shoulders <eos> always <eos> were for the other <eos> were for each other <eos> divided in the garden <eos> i am waiting for myself <eos> to cool off silently <eos> or to keep it by <eos> its a gutted one <eos> a side thats split away <eos> i take him quietly and hold him in my arms <eos> when they know you <eos> when they know you <eos> when they know you <eos> when they really really know you <eos> it will seem so obvious <eos> fixing what is never broken <eos> always im not in love with the sound of my voice <eos> i have been in love only one time <eos> i see red shows she is quiet the band is loud <eos> sharing beer from the can at the back of the crowd <eos> anyway ive only been in love the one time <eos> sometimes we dance you have convinced me to dance <eos> this is a testament of your power to convince <eos> i am convinced and continue to be convinced <eos> like i said ive only been in love the one time <eos> what light never goes dim <eos> what light never goes

<eos> i always struggle for the right words to say <eos> cause how could i try to describe in sentences that i cant believe a girl like you exists <eos> chorus <eos> so dont forget to smile when you see the sun come out <eos> cause your laughter and your love are all ive been thinking about <eos> just the thought of you sustains me and that smile of yours can make the whole world new <eos> i love the way i feel when im with you <eos> and when you say hello it makes me happier than you could ever know <eos> the way you light up every room youve ever walked into <eos> makes me glad that im with you <eos> chorus <eos> so dont forget to smile when you see the sun come out <eos> cause your laughter and your love are all ive been thinking of <eos> just the thought of you sustains me and that smile can make the whole world new <eos> i love the way i feel when im with you <eos> and the sun is pouring in through the window and right onto your skin i waited by the willow tree outside your parents house last night <eos> girl you know i warned you <eos> summers coming soon <eos> if your gonna make a move you better make your move <eos> cus you know that in a week or two <eos> ill be miles away from you <eos> on the california coast <eos> but you know the thing ill miss the most is you <eos> girl do you remember the time i held both your hands in mine <eos> and we watched the stars come out that night <eos> you said your heart could hardly take <eos> the moons reflection on the glossy lake <eos> and i just whispered i love you <eos> because you know that in a week or two <eos> ill be miles away from you <eos> on the california coast <eos> but you know the thing i miss the most is <eos> if you miss me so much <eos> that you can barely stand it <eos> and your heart can hardly take it <eos> you know im never more than a phone call away <eos> i wont hesitate to answer my phone <eos> when your name shows up on my caller id <eos> but you know i cant stay <eos> because summer is calling me <eos> calling me <eos> but you know that in a week or two <eos> ill be miles away from you <eos> on the california coast <eos> but you know the thing ill miss the most is you i know that im awake <eos> but im dreaming all the same <eos> i know that you are scared <eos> but baby dont be <eos> cause its one thing to say <eos> everything will be okay <eos> and quite another thing <eos> to believe it <eos> i know that sometimes <eos> things can get so rough <eos> and i know that sometimes <eos> words are not enough <eos> and i know its been a hard year <eos> being apart <eos> but it was better <eos> than the one before <eos> i know that were okay <eos> but i worry all the same <eos> i know that you are strong <eos> but you dont always have to be <eos> cause its one thing to say <eos> everything will be okay <eos> and quite another thing <eos> to believe it <eos> i know that sometimes <eos> things can get so rough <eos> and i know that sometimes <eos> words are not enough <eos> and i know its been a hard year <eos> being apart <eos> but it was better <eos> than the one before summer arrived on the back of a mockingbird <eos> it sang a sweet melody but couldnt seem to find the right words <eos> i dont know if youve heard <eos> but its all over town yeah theyre buzzing about it now <eos> i was singing along when the mockingbird came to me <eos> perched on my windowsill and hummed along quietly <eos> but before long she was singing along and she said yeah she said <eos> "ive been waiting so long for these words to come out <eos> its practically all ive been thinking about <eos> so thank you for finding the words i couldnt find on my own <eos> now im not alone" <eos> autumn was on its way summer was on its way out <eos> the mockingbird told me "i change with the seasons" <eos> and so she was leaving town in a few days now <eos> we said our goodbyes but i secretly wished for more time <eos> the seasons are merciless <eos> then for a while we both stood in silence until she said <eos> "ive been waiting so long for these words to come out <eos> its practically all ive been thinking about <eos> so thank you for finding the words i couldnt find on my own <eos> now im not alone" she gave up on love at years old <eos> said it was just a lie that the foolish told <eos> and finding herself all alone and cold <eos> she gave up on the world <eos> she lit up a smoke every day or two <eos> till eventually she lost count of how many packs shed gone through <eos> she thought that she had nothin left to lose <eos> she gave up on the world <eos> she hasnt been home now in several days <eos> tonight makes the third week straight <eos> hes been struggling to sleep since she ran away <eos> he hopes that she finds the strength that shes been looking for <eos> cause he just cant take the searching anymore <eos> she found some relief with a bottle in her hand <eos> but the bottle can be such a fickle friend <eos> she swore a million times shed never drink again <eos> she gave up on the world just tell me youre doing okay <eos> i cant help but think of you everyday <eos> and i know that its hard when im miles away <eos> but i know well be together some day <eos> fall is gone <eos> winter is here <eos> i spent all december just wanting you near <eos> so im singing these words in the hope that youll hear <eos> youre the best thing that happened this year <eos> ive fallen in love honestly <eos> so im wearing my heart on my sleeve <eos> in the hope that these notes and the words that i sing make you see <eos> you mean more than the world does to me <eos> let me be honest with you <eos> when i said i loved you it was more than the truth <eos> you see with each lonely night and day that i must go through <eos> well they just bring me closer to you <eos> ive fallen in love honestly <eos> so im wearing my heart on my sleeve <eos> in the hope that these notes and the words that i sing make you see <eos> you mean more than the world does to me <eos> ive fallen in love honestly <eos> so im wearing my heart on my sleeve <eos> in the hope that these notes and the words that i sing make you see <eos> you

<eos> step outside for just a moment <eos> for just a moment <eos> i stare out a dirty window pane <eos> and listen to the rain <eos> pours down and it covers everything <eos> and masks the noise from all the <eos> medical machinery <eos> i am left with the sound of your <eos> labor breathing <eos> chorus <eos> but you are close to going home now <eos> your father welcomes you with <eos> open arms <eos> a room has been prepared <eos> and so you dont have to be scared <eos> as you leave behind the struggles <eos> of this world <eos> the next day came with no improvements <eos> leaving you to explain <eos> these things take time <eos> these things take time <eos> you told me you were ready and <eos> you werent afraid to die <eos> he is always watching over you and i <eos> chorus leaves are changing you <eos> the weather is changing you <eos> you said i am changing too <eos> its that time of year again <eos> autumn is here again <eos> and all of the words that you said <eos> keep ringing in my head <eos> and im standing here <eos> hanging by a thread <eos> yeah i dont know what to do and so <eos> for now ill just enjoy my life on fairview <eos> soaking up the view <eos> im filling these pages <eos> with the words and the phrases <eos> i could use to make this dream come true <eos> when the lights go out at night <eos> i go to sleep and shut my eyes <eos> and know that i am always dreaming of you <eos> the air is getting colder <eos> rest your head here upon my shoulder <eos> and i swear that it will be okay <eos> and if you must borrow my sweater <eos> in the light of this fall weather <eos> just be sure to have it back by tomorrow <eos> time is moving slower now <eos> i wanna make it stop somehow <eos> and stay here in this moment forever <eos> i dont know what to do and so <eos> for now ill just enjoy my life on fairview <eos> soaking up the view <eos> im filling these pages <eos> with the words and the phrases <eos> i could use to make this dream come true

<eos> everything is gonna be alright i promise <eos> go to sleep and dream of me tonight <eos> everything may not be perfect but at least we tried <eos> so tonight <eos> sweet dreams and sleep tight <eos> ive been trying so hard cant get you out of my mind <eos> and if this is how it has to be just promise you wont forget me <eos> and ill leave you with this lullaby tonight <eos> i know that this hurts you it hurts me too <eos> i wish there was something i could do to make it easier for you <eos> sometimes its tough too soon to call it love but i wanted to <eos> yeah i wanted to but its too late now to say all <eos> the wonderful things that i thought of you did you know you have a special way of turning around my terrible days you make all the bad things go away the second that you say hello its the way that you talk that you laugh that you smile if beauty was inches youd go on for miles its the way that you make everything seem worth while the second that you say hello its the way every love song reminds me of you along with the stars and the sunset here too its the way that you make the sky seem much more blue the second that you say hello so if love is a drug then i guess im addicted all i want is to have yours its making my heart sick goodbye is what broke it and you were what fixed it the second that you said hello if you hear this wherever you are <eos> just know i need you here <eos> i need you near me now <eos> you were brighter than the pale white moon <eos> reflected in your eyes <eos> so i guess its no surprise <eos> i cant forget you <eos> no matter what i do <eos> i will always carry you in my heart <eos> youll always be my shooting star <eos> autumn days will fade away <eos> but memories will always stay the same <eos> im hoping you will never change <eos> dont ever change <eos> i just need to slow down for a while <eos> im missing your warm smile <eos> and the way you used to say <eos> "stay with me till the daylight breaks <eos> no matter what it takes <eos> just say youll stay" <eos> i will always carry you in my heart <eos> youll always be my shooting star <eos> autumn days will fade away <eos> but memories will always stay the same <eos> im hoping you will never change <eos> dont ever change im a coward <eos> i hide behind all these delicate lines i sing <eos> but im trying to come clean <eos> im so lonely <eos> surrounded by people who know me but dont know a thing <eos> so im trying to come clean <eos> and every relationship ive ever been in <eos> has fallen apart at the seams <eos> and im just afraid ive been singing about love <eos> but ill never find out what it means <eos> and if i was honest about what the problem is <eos> id have to admit that its me <eos> im just tryin to live up to all that you want me to be <eos> im a liar <eos> i sing pretty things <eos> but i never quite say what i mean <eos> so im trying to come clean <eos> im so sorry <eos> i know that i cant take it back <eos> no i cant change a thing <eos> so im trying to come clean <eos> and every relationship ive ever been in <eos> has fallen apart at the seams <eos> and im just afraid ive been singing about love <eos> but ill never find out what it means <eos> and if i was honest about what the problem is <eos> id have to admit that its me <eos> im just tryin to live up to all that you want me to be everything is different now <eos> why are you so distant now <eos> everything has changed <eos> yeah nothing is the same <eos> since the day you went away <eos> nothing feels at all okay with me <eos> dont you ever miss the midwest sunrise <eos> the view of the stars and the full moon at night <eos> cause ever since you left <eos> theres been an open hole in my chest <eos> yeah you left this boy such a mess <eos> but im hoping that my heart will find some rest tonight <eos> ill try to explain exactly why ive been crying all the time since you walked out of my life <eos> everything is different now <eos> why are you so distant now lately ive been getting impatient <eos> i can feel every second <eos> of every hour every day <eos> lately ive been thinking too much and <eos> the thought of all the years <eos> ill have to wait keeps me awake <eos> time is passing oh so slowly oh <eos> they say the futures looking bright <eos> and i know these things take some waiting <eos> but arent we told that all the time <eos> lately ive been feeling like i am <eos> stuck with my roots in the ground <eos> but i am ready to move on <eos> lately ive been searching for words to <eos> describe how im feeling <eos> but lately all the words i have are wrong <eos> time is passing oh so slowly oh <eos> they say the futures looking bright <eos> and i know these things take some waiting <eos> but arent we told that all the time <eos> time is passing oh so slowly oh <eos> they say the futures looking bright <eos> and i know these things take some waiting <eos> but arent we told that all the time over fall break youre coming down to see me <eos> i know that the distance doesnt make this easy <eos> but when we come together it makes such a lovely sound <eos> and thats why id give anything i have to work this out <eos> and everything i ever did didnt matter up til now <eos> you make my life worth while like youve completed me somehow <eos> and when we come together it makes such a lovely sound <eos> thats why id give anything i have to work this out <eos> acoustic <eos> for the first time in my life i know that im in love <eos> i could write a thousand songs about you they would never be enough <eos> but when we come together it makes such a lovely sound <eos> thats why id give anything i have to work this out a warm afternoon in the middle of june <eos> and you didnt know that id fallen for you <eos> the long nights we stayed up excuses we made up <eos> and i didnt know that you felt this way too <eos> theres nothing as sweet as your voice is to me <eos> its better than summer and spring <eos> the words that you speak bring such <eos> comfort to me when were miles apart and im lonely <eos> and as i recall it was <eos> presidents hall where i found you a year had gone past <eos> the long days without you spent thinking about you <eos> and all of the memories they came flooding back <eos> theres nothing as sweet as your voice is to me <eos> its better than summer and spring <eos> the words that you speak bring such comfort to me <eos> when were miles apart and im lonely <eos> and darling i wont ever let you go <eos> so i just thought that id let you know <eos> theres nothing as sweet as your voice is to me <eos> its better than summer and spring <eos> the words that you speak bring <eos> such comfort to me when were miles apart and im lonely her eyes are like the sunrise <eos> her voice is like a summer breeze <eos> when its ninetyeight degrees outside <eos> its refreshing <eos> she could be the best thing thats ever happened to me <eos> but shes so far away <eos> somehow ill find a way <eos> shes so far away from me <eos> but she visits each night in my dreams every time i see your smile it makes my heart beat fast <eos> and though its much too soon to tell im hoping this will last <eos> cause i just always wanna have you right here by my side <eos> the futures near but never certain <eos> at least stay here for just tonight <eos> i must have done something right to deserve you in my life <eos> i must have done something right along the way <eos> i just cant get you off my mind and why would i even try <eos> even when i close my eyes i dream about you all the time <eos> i just always wanna have you right here by my side <eos> the futures near but never certain <eos> so please stay here for just tonight <eos> i must have done something right to deserve you in my life <eos> i must have done something right along the way <eos> even if the moon fell down tonight <eos> thered be nothing to worry about at all because you make the whole world shine <eos> as long as youre here everything will be alright <eos> i must have done something right to deserve you in my life <eos> i must have done something right along the way you were so bitter for so very long <eos> i was young and refused to be wrong <eos> and in the end we couldnt save what we both helped to make <eos> and maybe ive made some mistakes <eos> maybe ive witnessed the way a heart breaks <eos> and maybe i shouldve done things differently but i didnt and we parted ways <eos> whos to say things arent better this way <eos> i swear that im sorry that i couldnt be the hero that you wanted from me <eos> and in the end we couldnt fix what we both helped to break and maybe ive made some mistakes <eos> and maybe ive witnessed the way a heart breaks <eos> and maybe i shouldve done things differently but i didnt and we parted ways <eos> whos to say things arent better this way do you remember <eos> the chill in the air in november <eos> the autumn breeze wrapped us in blankets <eos> and we held our breath and closed our eyes <eos> do you recall that <eos> we thought it would all last forever <eos> the days of our youth and the weather <eos> and the love that we wore on our chests <eos> but all good things must end <eos> and do you remember <eos> watching the sun set together <eos> the rays of the sun lit up every last one of the memories we held in our fists <eos> do you recall that <eos> we always swore that we would never <eos> forget all those days and weather that led us to display our love on our chests <eos> but all good things must end <eos> and we both know <eos> that we were just making the poorest excuses <eos> like we all do <eos> just to feel like we have something solid <eos> to hold on to three years ago i was so sure <eos> but now im not sure of anything anymore <eos> its like the past is gripping my throat <eos> and i choke <eos> and im still hoping ill find out <eos> its all a bad joke <eos> so dont dont tell me its over <eos> and dont dont say that ill be alright <eos> if i could trade twenty years <eos> for one more with you <eos> then i would <eos> id turn back time <eos> make the whole world rewind <eos> if i could <eos> if i knew that youd haunt my dreams <eos> every time that i sleep <eos> then id lay my head down <eos> and id close my eyes for good <eos> three years went by <eos> and i thought you and i were a sure thing <eos> but as it turns out <eos> i guess i cant count on anything <eos> youd change your mind <eos> and nothing is quite what it seems <eos> you said forever <eos> but i guess you dont know what that means <eos> so dont dont tell me its over <eos> and dont dont tell me ill be alright <eos> if i could trade twenty years <eos> for one more with you <eos> then i would <eos> id turn back time <eos> make the whole world rewind <eos> if i could <eos> if i knew that youd haunt my dreams <eos> every time that i sleep <eos> then id lay my head down <eos> and id close my eyes for good i was sitting in a coffee shop <eos> when you walked in and my jaw dropped <eos> at the cutest smile in the world <eos> yeah i know that we just met <eos> but its too late cause i am set <eos> on making you my girl <eos> who need true love <eos> baby weve got new love <eos> maybe thats enough <eos> i know starting out is tough <eos> but weve got time love <eos> and you can have all my love <eos> if you want it

<eos> when the stars are not out and the moon has burned out i still find myself gazing at you <eos> if i could just see this through if i could just be with you <eos> forever and always then id be okay <eos> and these lonely days would be all in the past <eos> if i could just speak right now if all of the words would just come out somehow <eos> then you could just stay here for hours in my arms <eos> and we would be finally together at last <eos> youve got the best memory <eos> i love when you stop and you tell the story <eos> of the day we first met with the details i tend to forget <eos> youve got the loveliest way <eos> of being impatient that ive ever seen <eos> especially the way that you say you cant wait till i hold you in my arms again <eos> if i could just see this through if i could just be with you <eos> forever and always then id be okay <eos> and these lonely days would be all in the past <eos> if i could just speak right now if all of the words would just come out somehow <eos> then you could just stay here for hours in my arms <eos> and we would be finally together at last as i look out on the sunrise on the indiana <eos> skyline <eos> and its rays are resting heavy on my face <eos> i think about the days i spent <eos> just wishing i was home again <eos> instead of always traveling place to place <eos> ive been homesick <eos> because ive laid deep roots <eos> in indiana soil where i spent up all my youth <eos> and ive been waiting just to be back home again <eos> and feel the indiana sun shine on my skin <eos> as i look out on the sunset <eos> and i try hard not to forget <eos> all the memories that i made while i was here <eos> i think of all the friends ive made <eos> and all the people i should thank <eos> for lessons i have learned over the years <eos> ive been homesick <eos> because ive laid deep roots <eos> in indiana soil where i spent up all my youth <eos> and ive been waiting just to be back home again <eos> and feel the indiana sun shine on my skin <eos> home is where the hearts been waiting <eos> oh so patient just to hear the sound <eos> of the back door open <eos> its always open <eos> ive been hoping just to find my way back here <eos> again <eos> because ive been homesick <eos> because ive laid deep roots <eos> in indiana soil where i spent up all my youth <eos> and ive been waiting just to be back home again <eos> and

honestly we both knew that from the start <eos> but like a ride up high on a ferris wheel <eos> it aint wrong to feel like you can fly <eos> knowing that youll come back down <eos> at the end of the ride <eos> our relationship is like a burning star i guess <eos> and once our time runs out there will be nothing left <eos> its meant to shed its light and its meant to some day die <eos> and honestly we both know that tonight is that night <eos> but like a shooting star in a valid sky <eos> it aint wrong to stop and to smile <eos> even though you just witnessed its demise it was raining on the day when we first met but you held my hand and the sun came out <eos> ive been holding my breath ever since cause it doesnt make sense how a princess like you could end up with a pauper like me <eos> but so long as the story ends happily i dont care i fell in love once before <eos> now i wont be fallin for that anymore <eos> somewhere in your basement <eos> i think i misplaced my heart <eos> what did i do that for <eos> i dont want to see you <eos> i dont want to hear your sweet voice <eos> no i dont want to talk anymore <eos> so if you happen to find it <eos> id be much oblidged <eos> if youd drop it off at my front door <eos> and dont leave a note cause i swear if you wrote me <eos> id probably take it all back <eos> and god only knows i must stay on my toes <eos> cause i cant allow myself to do that <eos> i always wanted you to stay <eos> but now im wishing you away <eos> if this is what love feels like <eos> im done with this <eos> i fell in love once before <eos> now i wont be fallin for that anymore <eos> youd whisper to me as wed watch some tv <eos> as wed lay on your living room floor <eos> i dont want to see you <eos> i dont want to hear your sweet voice <eos> no i dont want to talk anymore <eos> so if you happen to think of me <eos> dont think that i will be waiting around like before you met her in summer you thought that you loved her and you called her yours by the springtime <eos> but something was changing and round came the fall <eos> and by winter she ended it all <eos> by winter she ended it all <eos> and oh youll be fine when the seasons come round <eos> and youll love once again <eos> but for now youll be hurting and desperate <eos> be patient while time heals the pain that youre in <eos> oh be patient while time heals the pain that youre in <eos> another summer just like all the others <eos> and you fell in love by the springtime <eos> but something was changing and round came the fall <eos> and by winter you ended it all <eos> by winter you ended it all <eos> and oh youll be fine when the seasons come round <eos> and youll love once again <eos> but for now youll be hurting and desperate <eos> be patient while time heals the pain that youre in <eos> oh be patient while time heals the pain that youre in lately ive been thinking hard <eos> if life is a play whats my part <eos> am i just meant to be a boy lost out at sea <eos> cause

chance for the heal <eos> a chance for a life to be saved <eos> when youre coming apart at the seam <eos> holding on tight to the rail <eos> when youre losing your sight of the dream <eos> when youre

running from me blind <eos> living another future <eos> lookin for a sign <eos> standing on the corner <eos> of another state of mind city lights burning so brightly they beckon me home <eos> the tales of the past lie under the surfaces cold <eos> they taunt me with memories beyond the zanzibar high <eos> drown me in sorrows that led me so close i could die <eos> take me inside <eos> ill step off the ride <eos> lead me to home <eos> to things i have known <eos> and im fading <eos> watching that resevoir fading <eos> leaving that resevoir high <eos> leaving that resevoir dry <eos> these city streets change but their essence is still just the same <eos> and zanzibar stands like a vision of torment now tame <eos> the victims are healed and the scars have all recently dried <eos> the blood now flows freely within and has nothing to hide lovers kiss <eos> the haunting eyes of the innocent <eos> i hold you close <eos> in the sweet caress <eos> of your wedding dress <eos> i lay you down <eos> lost in the sound <eos> of the temptress queen <eos> she rules the world <eos> underneath my feet <eos> i hold her close <eos> just to feel her need <eos> pray shell never leave <eos> shell never see <eos> chorus <eos> all my senses are to blame <eos> my dear <eos> all my lovers effigies are burning but the one <eos> all our mysteries are meant to be <eos> the secrets of your heart

instrumental instrumental instrumental oh oh oh oh oh <eos> so youll meet me there <eos> behind those castle walls <eos> just like before <eos> we walked right through <eos> those empty halls <eos> it made me think about <eos> the land of gathering <eos> and what would happen if <eos> we ever saw the king <eos> oooh <eos> maybe since were gone and <eos> all is through <eos> ive got such a view <eos> ive got such a view <eos> oh oh oh oh oh <eos> we pulled the rope so that <eos> the gate would start to fall <eos> and no one watched to see <eos> the final curtain call <eos> the paper set tore up <eos> so the swords didnt swing <eos> and whyd i think the choir <eos> would stop the songs they sing <eos> oh they didnt <eos> oooooh <eos> maybe since were gone and <eos> all is through <eos> ive got such a view <eos> ive got such a view <eos> maybe since were gone and <eos> all is through <eos> ive got such a view <eos> ive got such a view <eos> maybe since were gone and <eos> all is through <eos> ive got such a view <eos> ive got such a view <eos> maybe since were gone and <eos> all is through <eos> ive got such a view <eos> ive got such a view im all alone <eos> sitting down in the corner <eos> of the room <eos> im scared to think <eos> cause thoughts are company i cant keep <eos> so i assume <eos> kind hearts command <eos> carries into a no mans land <eos> where i recite <eos> all the words in the name of fright <eos> in the name of fright of fright <eos> cause there aint no room for me <eos> in this world <eos> but theres no place id rather be <eos> than to be here <eos> now i can lay me down to sleep <eos> albeit calm and unquiet <eos> so let me show you how to be <eos> in your heart <eos> in your heart <eos> your heart <eos> and while i sit <eos> it seems to me <eos> that i am weak <eos> and brittle boned <eos> but soon i know someone will find me <eos> and ask me why <eos> in the name of fright <eos> i think i might <eos> but i cant tell whats wrong from right <eos> and if i may <eos> follow me ill find you a way <eos> ill find a way <eos> a way you make a real good case for never leavin homewould never turn you back on me <eos> but if it makes you last until the second round <eos> i cant expect to wait patiently <eos> cant leave it unrevenged <eos> ill keep a watchful eye on whats behind you <eos> what might drop you in the dirt <eos> youve got a special arrow just to shoot at me <eos> thats so gangsta and so true <eos> whatever happens here will naver make a change <eos> you can feel it in the air <eos> its just the card that was dealt to me <eos> cant leave it unrevenged <eos> arrest me now before you get to change your mind <eos> i always wanted it that way <eos> if theres a way to stop before its too late <eos> please let me know what that is <eos> whatever it is it makes me want to set things straight <eos> make it better make it right <eos> but it just cant keep me from falling down <eos> it just cant keep me from falling down <eos> it just cant keep me from falling down <eos> cant leave it unrevenged <eos> take my blood and take my marrow <eos> scrape the meal from my bone <eos> pierce my heart if you please <eos> with your arrow <eos> but veda my darling <eos> come home <eos> darling child for you i labor <eos> grease and glass in my skin <eos> though you sneer and crack wise <eos> i wont waver but <eos> veda my darling <eos> come in come in <eos> sweet thing let me dress you for bed <eos> now slip that gown off your head <eos> ill kiss you one thousand times my angel <eos> close your eyes and my savage mind <eos> will fashion a day when youd be tender <eos> when youd be kind <eos> for you see the <eos> star beneath which you were delivered <eos> gave you coldhearted pride <eos> you look down on your mother who loves you <eos> you take without grace though it smarts <eos> i dont mind <eos> if your lover has done you wrong you <eos> slipped as you gripped his gun <eos> and found yourself oer his <eos> lifeless body <eos> child id rush to turn myself in and <eos> claim that it was my sin <eos> to spare you <eos> yes for darling <eos> in this town of light and shadow <eos> dreams become crooked and low <eos> if ive lost my way it was only to please you <eos> but veda my darling you already know in this black garden <eos> of this carrion light <eos> there is a suspension <eos> of motion and stillness <eos> that hollows the night <eos> in this black garden <eos> of heartbreak and wonder <eos> the banks are all ablaze <eos> selfsatisfied <eos> as they plunder <eos> i am alone on this hill <eos> these vistas are certain <eos> i may be frightened by the sounds <eos> of history crying as it drowns <eos> but i will pull back the curtain <eos> in this black garden <eos> i once called the selfish city <eos> i try to calculate the anguish <eos> and the anger and all the aspirations <eos> of the millions who have lived here <eos> and will live in desperation <eos> who are careful and are careless <eos> whom i have cheated <eos> who thought the swindle that i offered <eos> was a salve tribal neon <eos> on the rooftop <eos> through the fog <eos> search lights white dove <eos> am i dying <eos> am i done <eos> have you known <eos> anyone designed to break down <eos> i was shown <eos> pictures that i thought <eos> were family <eos> hong kong slaveship <eos> all the symbols <eos> on the mast <eos> gleaming squalor decay grown taller <eos> through the ceiling <eos> through the glass <eos> have you known <eos> anyone designed to break down <eos> oh oh have you really known <eos> anyone at all <eos> like me the dark city <eos> thinks its recall <eos> is its own <eos> but have not its thoughts <eos> been suggested <eos> in the bone <eos> ive seen things <eos> you people would not believe like <eos> great glittering cbeams <eos> fires feeding on an airplane <eos> all these thoughts <eos> moments ive collected <eos> all all will be lost <eos> lost like tears in rain wake the sky <eos> burn up the chaparral <eos> light it on fire <eos> break the horizon line <eos> scatter the travelers <eos> birds on the wire <eos> when i survey the city <eos> from my perch upon a hill there are dark buildings <eos> shrouded in fog shrouded in still <eos> i would lay it all to ruin <eos> i would alchemize it all to sand <eos> i would watch metropolis crumble <eos> to prove that im your man <eos> end this jag <eos> of anger and loneliness <eos> of failure at peace <eos> fill the bottle and soak the rag <eos> dont limit collateral <eos> ignite for release <eos> i would set it all to flame <eos> i would set it all to flame <eos> and the laborers will crawl out <eos> of the smoking windows <eos> and they wont know who to blame <eos> and they wont know who to blame <eos> and the slumlords will be <eos> crocodiles before the council <eos> when the coastlines turned to ashes <eos> and the movie stars have run away <eos> i will build my love a castle <eos> and there we two shall stay <eos> and if anyone should trespass <eos> ill have it rigged through with wire <eos> that the slightest false disturbance <eos> would turn our palisade to a pyre yeah yeah <eos> ooh yeah yeah

something wrong with his hand <eos> there was something strange about jesus <eos> he didnt follow lucifers commands <eos> lucifer said "jesus be straight" <eos> and jesus said "the gates would never open if this was true" <eos> oh something about a vision in a park <eos> of jesus holding hands with an angel named lark mcgee <eos> lucifer therefore lost his wings <eos> and all the angels sing all the angels sing <eos> god is gay god is gay sitting in the fields <eos> the blood coloured fields <eos> and wonder about the day <eos> i was coming back to life <eos> i clearly remember <eos> the bright shining light <eos> coming through the skies <eos> gazing through my eyes <eos> i remember <eos> how i trembled as i saw your body <eos> i remember how divine i felt <eos> as i saw your face <eos> sweet child o mine <eos> suddenly the light <eos> was gone forever gone <eos> i heard the birds cry in the sky <eos> and teardrops falling to the ground <eos> aurora borealis <eos> that moment i knew <eos> that something unusually <eos> had happened to me <eos> i opened my eyes and i realized <eos> that i was coming back to life <eos> aurora borealis <eos> a part of me is still in your sky i wish i could <eos> turn me into something <eos> try to neglect the reason <eos> that you passed away <eos> i wish i could hide into the dark <eos> vanish through my reflection <eos> into the blood coloured sun <eos> all the love we once had become <eos> has vanished and is forever gone <eos> we didnt dare to open our eyes <eos> and realize our own disquise <eos> i wish i could rewind the nights <eos> were you and me gazed with numbed eyes music terp lyrics frolund <eos> beyond the metaphysical spectre <eos> there was perfect light <eos> only light there was no hint of darkness <eos> nor was this moment ever in the past <eos> nor could it ever be outside time <eos> it simply was perfect eternal pure <eos> existence <eos> the universe spun and so did us <eos> not as beings but as monads in a reverie <eos> in gravitys grip no circle was pure <eos> no being was being yet by being we were <eos> eternal forever an instant of lights electricity <eos> we were stars sea seed galaxies quarks <eos> nano things shinning on some starlit <eos> for eons or seconds we were exactly the same <eos> existences essence could be nothing than less <eos> all were rapidly burning through nothingness <eos> all were <eos> the same were <eos> eternally around you within me <eos> was only light <eos> solo broberg how lovely <eos> youre standing in the rain <eos> i want to feel you <eos> hold you and kiss you <eos> i want to kill you <eos> and see you flying high <eos> but how can i make your <eos> dream come through <eos> and how can i show you elyzium <eos> please follow my dream <eos> for eternity follow me <eos> i dont know who i am <eos> who are you <eos> through my life i have <eos> crucified heaven and christ <eos> eventhough my god is eternally <eos> my last wish is to open your flower <eos> make your hunger come through <eos> and reach elyzian fields <eos> from the depth of tranquillity music terpvestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> we were the avengers of life <eos> the men without heads <eos> playing with ourselves like marionettes <eos> we were lost in streams <eos> lost inside an electric dream <eos> believed we were ego cuasa sui <eos> another god another plastic machine <eos> we questioned the existence <eos> of other beside being ourselves <eos> believed everything comes from nothing <eos> and that nothing comes from everything <eos> we saw our faces painted in neon colours <eos> a few electrifed faces <eos> only scratched down painted down on transparent flesh <eos> we were the avengers of life <eos> the men without heads <eos> playing with ourselves like stupid marionettes <eos> we were infants still bleeding in our mothers womb <eos> black eyed kings dead cursed and doomed <eos> we saw our flesh as spots <eos> inside the misty dark of our brain <eos> and we believed that the perception <eos> only happend inside our heads they where born in the name of god <eos> they where the superiors in the name of god <eos> hey you outside the cold <eos> dressed in white and looking old <eos> what did you think you were told <eos> did you think we were living forever <eos> did you ever fell innocent <eos> i dont think so <eos> and yet i dont think as we fall deeper <eos> why <eos> they were born in the name of god <eos> they declined in the name of god <eos> why god <eos> hey you outside the cold <eos> dressed in white and looking old <eos> what did you think you were told you tell what i do what i need <eos> but i feel the brain is trapped <eos> and im insane <eos> hey woman slow down <eos> hey woman slow down <eos> as you dont need to set <eos> the control of the heart <eos> of me anymore <eos> het woman slow down <eos> hey woman slow down <eos> as im the one to reign <eos> in my kingdom of slain <eos> as im the capture of fire <eos> that burns with darkest desire <eos> so dont tell me what to do <eos> as im the master im the blaster <eos> and dont tell you love me to <eos> as im dynamite and im terrified <eos> that ill maybe break down <eos> hey woman slow down <eos> hey woman slow down <eos> so dont take my friends <eos> away from me did you ever feel me <eos> did you ever taste me <eos> did you hear my cries <eos> they were thirsting <eos> they were bursting <eos> through my darkest skies <eos> no and you never gave a damn thingbut <eos> you tried to drain me <eos> you tried to break me <eos> you tried to kill me <eos> you fucking hated me <eos> could i ever buirn <eos> burn and ever learn <eos> when your venus wouldnt shine <eos> shine and spreading wide <eos> wide and bright <eos> so i could feel fine <eos> no and you never gave a damn thingbut <eos> you tried to drain me <eos> you tried to break me <eos> you tried to kill me <eos> you fucking hated me <eos> in this room music terpvestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> hey little girl <eos> i would like to show you <eos> my photo collection <eos> here i stand with jack in my hand <eos> you were perfect little girl <eos> so perfect <eos> hey yellow girl <eos> here i stand in <eos> nomansland <eos> with a stupid sun in my hand <eos> my love to you were too strong <eos> and since youre no more <eos> i have brought this gun <eos> soon ill put it to my head <eos> pull the trigger <eos> then im dead <eos> hey black girl <eos> here i sit on my bed <eos> with wild staring eyes <eos> pretending im already dead <eos> hey little girl <eos> will you miss me like i miss you <eos> when you see the photo <eos> of my blood painted room music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> silently flew away <eos> away from sun moon and big dismay <eos> away from earth and all the stupid people <eos> away from thoughts and evil <eos> away from fruitless tries <eos> away from all the feeble lies <eos> round and round repeating in your head <eos> haunting memories nauseating your heart <eos> remembering the creeping pain of loss <eos> putting on a false smile <eos> trying to be happy man youre not <eos> remembering the creeping pain of loss <eos> silently flew away <eos> with the memory of a reckoning day <eos> all life you have run from failure <eos> looked in every corner for a friendly saviour <eos> that could save just one day and make your pain go away <eos> blessed are the sick blessed are we <eos> solo vestergaard <eos> silently flew away against the metaphysical specture <eos> against a causa sui god <eos> you believe will make you completely electric innocent and erotic <eos> she slept in the arms of nature <eos> she was the princess of passion <eos> the light of day fairly and sinful <eos> she woke up to a dewfull morning <eos> which kissed her body <eos> and the feeling of vibrations <eos> she flew down to the sea for bathing <eos> and there she was lost <eos> lost forever in the grip of tenderness <eos> a tiny voice said <eos> float into me make love to me <eos> as million drops like these <eos> have people soved into me <eos> who are you i am the one who reflects the sun <eos> i and the waves carresses you gentle <eos> child you must breath <eos> before you sleep <eos> so child breath <eos> she says <eos> the nature inside me <eos> the trunk without life <eos> dirty water and the sun isnt smiling <eos> why god why <eos> the princess opened up her never opening flower <eos> and combined in passion the two lovers were forever <eos> the end of a tragical love story when you feel like someone to rely on <eos> and you feel like someone <eos> who kissed the snake <eos> ran away hid in the dark <eos> for someone you relied on <eos> who needed to run <eos> for the hidden gun <eos> in vain for the twisted one <eos> in someone <eos> then run <eos> when everything is sad <eos> and you dont know <eos> whether youre alive or dead <eos> cast the dies burn the old wife <eos> choose life dont you be sorry mrs pink <eos> you are just a blink of an eye <eos> every mans alternative <eos> still a sweet sugar cream <eos> you are adorable smiling <eos> and you never ask for anything <eos> and thats why i like you <eos> my little pink thing <eos> so let down <eos> your soul to me <eos> so let down <eos> your panties for me <eos> as youre the pink nail <eos> the nail i need <eos> the nail that bleed <eos> when i wish so here i stand <eos> in nomanland <eos> with a sun <eos> in my hand <eos> which sparkles with <eos> your dead beams <eos> through moons creek <eos> noyou cant run you cant crawl <eos> through the life you onceadored <eos> eventhough pain is too strong <eos> and you cant take it anymore <eos> sun is burning <eos> ever eternal <eos> infernal burning <eos> dangerous mad <eos> forever screwed <eos> remind me of you <eos> noyou cant run you cant crawl <eos> through the life you onceadored <eos> eventhough pain is too strong <eos> and you cant take it anymore <eos> her devilish soul <eos> what is the healing of life if life is pointless <eos> what is the meaning of life if we are limited <eos> to the desires and passions we feel <eos> why dont we tear down the wall when dreams <eos> and souls are hold imprisoned <eos> why is too little handed over to fatasism and psychedealism <eos> why not be free as the eagle and hunt the passions you see <eos> why not remains as your black god infinite in the cynic flesh <eos> what the hell have i done <eos> you break me silent we are laying here in the desert <eos> no trues no flowers <eos> just us bathing in eachothers blood and passions <eos> stoned we are <eos> the sun glows like an inflamed eye <eos> the light is bright and the eye of a snake comes above <eos> stoned we are <eos> danzing summer <eos> danzing you and me <eos> weird love and danzing summer <eos> the first kiss and the gentle <eos> words from your burning lips <eos> pure poetry <eos> naked we are danzing <eos> a serenade for the lonelyness <eos> the depression the love and the blood <eos> eternaly we shall fly high <eos> stoned we are ill cry alone <eos> when the curtain fell <eos> down from the sky and <eos> storms through my distressed <eos> seat of passion <eos> ill cry alone <eos> when tranquillity diffuse <eos> in winds of funeral hall <eos> and cover my mournfull tears <eos> with a thick lay of pain <eos> then i will speed through the heavens <eos> i will speed through my life <eos> speed through time <eos> then i will speed through the heavens <eos> i will speed through my life <eos> speed through time <eos> then let all leaves <eos> descend into a deep sleep <eos> and let the ache amplitude <eos> in every corner were malignancy is lurking <eos> let me be silhouetted <eos> upon the unlitting sky <eos> as i draw down my life <eos> on tissue paper and silent decline away <eos> then ill speed through the heavens <eos> and ill speed through time <eos> speed through time <eos> then ill speed through the heaven <eos> ill speed through the night <eos> let me be silhouetted <eos> upon the unlitting sky <eos> when im drawing down my life <eos> let me be silhouetted <eos> as i silent decline away <eos> ill cry alone music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> greatest species on mother earth <eos> were you and i <eos> i greeted hallucinations and you holy survived <eos> i seek meaning of life i walked wind and fire <eos> we created a world so fertile that we someday could feed <eos> our forthcoming children and later watch them bleed <eos> i was fragile and naive and comfortably numb present <eos> i pinned a dead faith to a lifeless yellow blessing <eos> forced the highest dignity <eos> through a selfhandmade divinity <eos> who was untouchable and mighty as a king <eos> but weak as my sex and my sin <eos> i was enlightened by fear capture of solemn tears <eos> endeavour of infinity devoted to philosophy <eos> solo broberg <eos> i crushed the ancient mirror and created a new one <eos> manufactured my own god machine <eos> based on mortal men philosophies <eos> pinned my life to this god machine <eos> and killed the artifical one now everyone i knew is gobe music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> imagine the complications in our useless lives <eos> and the frustrations were building <eos> withing our selfless tries <eos> were consumed within our mediocre tears <eos> and our minds are fucked for several years <eos> you live you learn so they say <eos> but the lesson you have been told <eos> remains the same every single day <eos> but whenever you go out <eos> destiny is at our back <eos> sticks to you like a black heavy cat <eos> were trying to make sense of absurd things <eos> bearing our burden on heavy wings <eos> gather all our joys and sorrows <eos> but life is still completely shallow <eos> were reaching out to cease the day <eos> and climb the highest tree in big dismay <eos> what drives us to improve <eos> what drives us to go on <eos> i dont know <eos> cause tomorrow well be gone <eos> solo vestergaard <eos> solo broberg the sun glows <eos> like an inflamed eye <eos> and blinds our cosmos <eos> with illuminated beams <eos> blue <eos> but who cares <eos> in faint we slumber <eos> we dont percieve <eos> what is happening <eos> outside these cold walls <eos> above the passive houses <eos> a young man tries <eos> to take his life <eos> by walking the crossing line <eos> still the birds are hooding <eos> for the heated blue <eos> but they cannot find it <eos> instead they decline away <eos> the hazard wind blows cold <eos> and cover the animated skin <eos> with pain <eos> while we all pass away music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> you nawseate by your mediocre life <eos> gasping for breath like a dying child <eos> lowering your head from the heaviness <eos> of the stone that has kept you from your selfishness <eos> you strumble down the path of discontent <eos> claw dirt with your trembling hands <eos> light a cigar with a golden zippo <eos> while you run like hell against the gallows <eos> gallows of god so have a cigar <eos> youre soon going so far <eos> drink up your wine <eos> youll be just fine boy <eos> youre a matyr of life <eos> walking through the gallows of god <eos> solo broberg <eos> you cause yourself to flee along the misery <eos> perishing in frustrations beyond infinity <eos> numb emotions flooding through your soul <eos> death and freedom is your everlasting goal <eos> so over your shoulder <eos> you throw your heavy cross <eos> youre a matyr of life <eos> walking through the gallows of god we are the beloved sons <eos> but we shine like dead suns <eos> give us too much rope <eos> and we fuck it up <eos> the world keeps diving <eos> and we dont give a fuck <eos> cause we can choose <eos> straight from hate to love <eos> and try to look at yourself <eos> what do you think you are <eos> a superstar <eos> who is trying to escape <eos> but from whom your own tomb <eos> if the pain and the sin and the chilly wind sting <eos> and the soul and the hope and worlds to cold <eos> choose <eos> if the mood and the fruit and lifes mute <eos> and the love and the sun and the blood in the veins are gone <eos> choose catharsis <eos> or breath the air <eos> and try to take care <eos> dont set your control on fire <eos> then life will feel a bit lighter <eos> and youll soon be a bit brighter <eos> and a billion times taller <eos> and a million times smaller now my barbaric body <eos> becomes an easy prey <eos> to every wildanimal <eos> and every wind <eos> shall breath in the shadow <eos> of every numbness tree <eos> murmuring and whispering for his hideous sin <eos> julia went down <eos> down down to the ground <eos> to hell and never coming back <eos> to hell julia went down shell never return anymore <eos> ablazed and graft down <eos> and yet blossom as spring in its pride <eos> with apples like condemned devil heads <eos> and julia is no more <eos> as she walked out the door <eos> from which shell never be returning <eos> while she went down <eos> now her soul is scald <eos> in tartaros streams <eos> and feeds at hell deadly tree <eos> beyond lethe beyond bitterness fruit <eos> demons dwelling <eos> in iron of hungry flames <eos> her soul is seeking into orcus sea of flames <eos> julia went down <eos> down down to the ground music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> solo vestergaard <eos> do we know him well <eos> can he truly tell <eos> can he say he knows my name <eos> does he know who to blame <eos> can he see behind his mask <eos> does he know his task <eos> does he fear the life he leads <eos> will he walk where i do not know <eos> a place id like to see and show <eos> to view the world far and wide <eos> a place where he can replace his long lost life <eos> do we see the thousand tears <eos> he has shed through all his troubled years <eos> the times that he was left alone <eos> never to see what he had been show <eos> is all he has enough to last <eos> or will he need two dice to cast <eos> does he love what life denies <eos> will life succed his selfless tries <eos> or will he fall into a new disguise <eos> beyond this cold life <eos> solo brobergvestergaard no one felt like you and little i <eos> like a fragile leaf on a rainy night <eos> we opened our eyes in the sky <eos> in the hope of seeing the sign <eos> to move further our devoted lives <eos> and we bubbled with love <eos> and our stoned eyes <eos> were trapped within the sunshine <eos> between us nothing but air <eos> the love we despaired <eos> the cool breeze down the spine <eos> no one felt like you and little i <eos> like a fragile leaf on a rainy night <eos> comfortably numb and out of mind <eos> dead to the bone out of time <eos> and our minds up in the sky <eos> didnt pass us any single word <eos> eventhough we desperately tried <eos> but we couldnt find the words <eos> that would break the silence <eos> that surrounded us with slow demise <eos> between us nothing but air <eos> the love we despaired <eos> the cool breeze down the spine <eos> and the two frustrated clowns <eos> but i wanted to see <eos> what you were wearing inside <eos> but i couldnt break through <eos> as your sky was thicker than mine <eos> but devoted we were do you remember we tumbled around <eos> just like crazy dogs in town <eos> and we were dynamite <eos> and love was a delight <eos> every day and every night <eos> just you and me and your crazy dog <eos> a new morning rises <eos> and everythings fine <eos> a dog is mad a lunatic cat <eos> saw red and went blind <eos> a woman cries into the sky <eos> and sighs while you die <eos> and do you remember i was terrified <eos> as i couldnt she what made the dog bite <eos> naybe it was my flesh <eos> was it too sweet <eos> did i not treat your dog well <eos> didnt it any longer like me <eos> was i really such a creep <eos> but we are still one big family <eos> you and me and the crazy puppy <eos> and im dynamite <eos> and im terrified <eos> every day and night <eos> still terrified of you and your crazy dog can you hear a man <eos> hammering his face against the door <eos> he is to numb <eos> to use his hands <eos> can you see a man <eos> trying to talk with his wife <eos> but shell never let him in <eos> "because she is f someone else" <eos> im coming home <eos> the man invites her <eos> welcome to a new machine <eos> welcome to a new beginning <eos> the wife invites him <eos> welcome to the final chapter of life <eos> welcome to the final step of me <eos> welcome to a life in hell <eos> still home <eos> why can they never forgive <eos> why do i feel like a pig <eos> why is the world so cold <eos> why cant we greet a new morning <eos> did you see the man <eos> falling down to the ground <eos> he was begging on his bleeding knees <eos> did you cry the day <eos> you couldnt feel me <eos> or are you still a cynic bitch <eos> who will never forgive <eos> did you ever feel the same sin like i did music terp lyrics frolund <eos> watch me <eos> im falling <eos> inti the deep <eos> into the sea <eos> see me <eos> im breathing <eos> perfect breathing <eos> beneath the sea <eos> theres no way <eos> out of this deep <eos> theres no way <eos> out of this sea <eos> there is no hope <eos> for you or me <eos> so i just want <eos> to be beneath the sea <eos> so dont pull me out <eos> dont release me <eos> as my soul shall forever <eos> swim beneath this sea look at the colours in the dreaming water <eos> the moon sets in a sea of love <eos> far away stands a girl <eos> watching the slit open the sky <eos> tears are falling <eos> in her mind a pictured boy <eos> in her vain a bloodbubble <eos> which is tearing her apart <eos> black tears <eos> in her mind a pictured boy <eos> in her vain a bloodbubble <eos> which is tearing her apart <eos> black tears <eos> they are crawling <eos> they are falling <eos> on her breast <eos> through the dream she flew to the sky <eos> where the eyes of truth always are watching you <eos> she flew with tears to the hidden sky <eos> where dead angels sing <eos> and the love never dies <eos> black tears <eos> where the love of generations never dies instrumental what i feel today is somehow a slow decay <eos> so i guess i will pray <eos> together with bottle i dismay <eos> so i can end my day <eos> but the booze wont kill so i swallow ten pills <eos> in the hope they will release me <eos> from the dreadful memories <eos> that keep coming back on me <eos> im insane <eos> all the things that come to mind <eos> kill me one again <eos> but the drugs dont work and the booze only lurks <eos> so i guess its my conclusion <eos> that life is a piece of hard work <eos> mrs pink doesnt like me <eos> and im no longer happy <eos> im insane <eos> all the things that come to mind <eos> kill me once again <eos> mrs pink doesnt like me <eos> and im no longer happy <eos> so i guess i will cease <eos> the damned black leash <eos> no i can end my fucked up twisted life <eos> and drown my beloved wife music vestergaard lyrics frolund <eos> like a cosmic venus veiled in white <eos> carried upon intergalatic light <eos> you carried your golden wings and fiery eyes <eos> ever afloat in dark eternal skies <eos> forever <eos> like a comet racing in the sky <eos> youre moving faster than light <eos> youre encircling your lucky star <eos> and moon and sun are light years away <eos> pull him out of the chains of god <eos> before its too late i went too far when i was begging on my knees <eos> begging for your arms for you to hold around me <eos> i went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet <eos> waiting for your love waiting for our eyes to meet <eos> crying give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> oh give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> i went too far when i was begging on my knees <eos> when i cut my hands so you could stand and watch me bleed <eos> i went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet <eos> standing in my blood it was a taste of bittersweet <eos> crying give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> oh give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> why cant i turn around and walk away <eos> go back in time <eos> i had to turn around and walk away <eos> i couldnt stay i had to walk away <eos> im left behind with an empty hole <eos> and everything i am is gone <eos> i tried to reach for another soul <eos> so i can feel whole <eos> oh give me some love <eos> oh give me some love <eos> oh give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> oh give me some love give me some love and hold me <eos> give me some love and hold me tight <eos> why cant i turn around and walk away <eos> go back in time <eos> i had to turn around and walk away <eos> i couldnt stay i had to walk away mad world beats <eos> outside our hearts <eos> times of need <eos> we are apart <eos> under stars <eos> we are alone <eos> under stars <eos> knuckles move under his skin <eos> he wraps his heart and drives it in <eos> and they move it all around <eos> until we cry <eos> under stars <eos> under stars <eos> mother cries and turns around <eos> walks outside without a soul <eos> the rain against the skin <eos> while she faces every sin <eos> under stars <eos> under stars <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> they have only fallen asleep <eos> ive seen it many times <eos> each time

many years could go and i still wouldnt know just when i thought i was <eos> dont let the windows close no we open them wide and we cheer the thunder on <eos> when im far from my home look above and below let the anchors down when you say youre sure <eos> oh i want to know how you held on so when the waters far from the rowers arms and the rowers mark <eos> there is a story i always try to remember when the first snow falls <eos> the ending wanders along and it settles down on the ice when the rivers warm <eos> your boats gone loose from the ropes and you said there is hope still frozen with the oars <eos> a finer side to be on oh i wouldnt know one lovelier than yours <eos> when im far from my home look above and below let the anchors down when you say youre sure <eos> oh i want to know how you held on so when the waters far from the rowers arms and the rowers mark <eos> when im far from my home look above and below let the anchors down when you say youre sure <eos> oh i want to know how you held on so when the waters far from the rowers arms and the rowers mark well any sense i had is gone <eos> on an open field you had me run <eos> where is the light we had before <eos> i dont know why i ask at all <eos> i keep on talking carelessly <eos> i look in books and magazines <eos> thinking our word could be enough <eos> you look at me im burn it up <eos> when i hear your good advice im starting something <eos> and good advice im running from it <eos> i didnt ask and i didnt want it <eos> in an empty room you pardon me <eos> but all around us whispering <eos> but we have now anyones guess <eos> so just be rude or your kindest <eos> you give it out so easily <eos> that now i drown in reasoning <eos> i cant held or even hurt <eos> and every word makes me feel worse <eos> when i hear your good advice im starting something <eos> your good advice i keep running from it <eos> i shouldnt ask since i never wanted saint lonesome <eos> ears still ring from the sound of

pick me up take the meds from a paper cup <eos> the nurses they took me in they asked me where i was and who id been <eos> took the laces from my shoes cigarettes and my lighter <eos> seven hours agoi was really close <eos> quick to tell you why they use some depressed and some abused <eos> some people shuffle down the hall waiting for that cattle call <eos> aint what you did or you didnt do some things i have to keep away from you <eos> some nights i wish that i never left its the first night i ever <eos> seven hours agoi was really close a gulp of sweet and warm tea <eos> for this afternoon full of glee <eos> and youre here beside me <eos> with the smile and the voice <eos> were sitting at the terrace <eos> enjoying the orange skies <eos> through those cups of tea <eos> the conversation flows <eos> reff id love to do this everyday <eos> afternoon in the terrace <eos> tea and you <eos> tea and you <eos> just completing each other <eos> and make every afternoon be my favorite <eos> tea and you <eos> you keep talking about your day <eos> i just keep quiet and listen <eos> when the sun goes down <eos> you kiss me on my cheek <eos> reff x <eos> afternoon in the terrace <eos> tea and you <eos> afternoon in the terrace <eos> tea and you <eos> afternoon in the terrace <eos> tea and you <eos> afternoon in the terrace <eos> me and you its a long hard road <eos> through a rough edged land <eos> to the softest part of a man <eos> and its lined with stones <eos> and tangled in regrets <eos> that are just too hard to forget <eos> theres rusty signs <eos> overlooked on the way <eos> to the heart of a troubled man <eos> and you can loose yourself <eos> in the deep muddy ruts <eos> worn through by the pride of a man <eos> but letting go <eos> in a lonesome field <eos> theres a wildeyed mare <eos> tied to the weight of a man <eos> and she once ran free <eos> with the wind in her hair <eos> breathing hard for the love of a man <eos> he wont let her be <eos> she wont let him rest <eos> till he learns how to forgive <eos> but let her go <eos> forgiveness is a falling leaf <eos> in the changing of the years <eos> as it settles down to the cooling ground <eos> let it go <eos> let it go <eos> let it go cynicism has such clamorous voice <eos> that is easily heard as mans glamorous choice <eos> something rings clearly as though from afar <eos> to illume our minds <eos> and kindle our hearts <eos> love has overtaken us <eos> made our pulses pound <eos> for a greater cause <eos> love is so that it never was <eos> and its everything <eos> now that it has come to us <eos> there are times when we may <eos> have tried harder <eos> but thats dreamy old now <eos> replaced with such altar <eos> now our shields are all gone <eos> weve laid our armor down <eos> and surrender <eos> coz its all around <eos> love has overtaken us <eos> now our hearts are pounding <eos> for a greater cause <eos> love is so that it never was <eos> it is everything <eos> now that it has come to us <eos> some values will always last <eos> who wants to turn the wheel <eos> indifference waters down so fast <eos> juxtaposed with sins <eos> love has overtaken us <eos> and our hearts are pounding <eos> for a greater cause <eos> love is so that it never was <eos> it is everything <eos> now that it has come to us sky sky cam whats seen before you <eos> contrived tracking systems

that hole again <eos> i am a lump of jelly <eos> i am a dead fish <eos> i look up at the blue sky <eos> and i know that its just <eos> a temporary dive <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun <eos> sitting on the cold dirt floor <eos> i want to finish the counting of days on the walls <eos> i build a ladder from broken wish bones <eos> and squareshaped stones <eos> that my friends threw down in the hole <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun <eos> and even though i read maps to avoid them <eos> they change location every day <eos> and somehow all of my traces they vanish <eos> but shall one stay put <eos> shall one lay low <eos> shall one not go <eos> just to avoid this hole <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun <eos> sometimes we tip toe <eos> sometimes we run <eos> sometimes we wander while <eos> looking at the sun i look in the mirror and <eos> im weaker than my reflection <eos> this image is all i seek <eos> as i restlessly wonder up a peak <eos> so i turned it off <eos> and on again <eos> just like the shifting lights <eos> of day and night in my door way <eos> and the memorys of every thing <eos> thats ever said en done <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on <eos> my another me makes me worry <eos> a shortens always destructiveness <eos> as i lie in my diary <eos> to justify the choices i make <eos> so i turned it off <eos> and on again <eos> just like the shifting lights <eos> of day and night in my door way <eos> an the memorys of everything <eos> thats ever said en done <eos> it makes is easier to leave it on <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on in my mind im crawling on your floor <eos> vomiting and defeated <eos> total absence of grace <eos> your reluctant voice saying <eos> you decide your own fate but <eos> i wear rubber bands round my soul <eos> they keep me from crawling <eos> and these rubber bands round my soul <eos> they keep me from falling <eos> in my repeated dreams <eos> you stare at me with an empty gaze <eos> you turn your back on me <eos> and you search for more intriguing days <eos> loathing this <eos> controlling this <eos> let me get a hold of this so <eos> i wear rubber bands round my soul <eos> they keep me from crawling <eos> and these rubber bands round my soul <eos> they keep me from falling to let myself go <eos> to let myself flow <eos> is the only way of being <eos> theres no use telling me <eos> theres no use taking a step back <eos> a step back for me i shot my heart <eos> to let you go <eos> i shot it down for you <eos> but you dont know <eos> i let my soul grow cold <eos> and its all <eos> its all i could <eos> since then ive been <eos> reckoning the scars i left on your skin <eos> ive been recognizing the bullets <eos> i used for the execution <eos> they went straight through me <eos> and into you <eos> and thats where they are stuck in <eos> since then ive been <eos> reckoning the scars i left on your skin <eos> i turned myself into <eos> a different kind of me to be able to <eos> set my pride aside <eos> and its all its all i could <eos> im turning myself in <eos> crawling down in my coffin <eos> im turning myself in <eos> crawling down in my coffin my friend you left me in the end <eos> i cant believe im writing a song <eos> where friend rhymes with end <eos> but today <eos> i must cave in <eos> i have trouble forgetting those beautiful eyes <eos> as it is <eos> i must fill your space with lies <eos> friend <eos> you left me in the end <eos> i guess i knew it all along <eos> i guess i expected this song <eos> and it is as it appeared <eos> like a fist in my stomach and <eos> swallowing tears <eos> your song turned out a sad one <eos> just as i feared yesterday we did it again <eos> we did what we re supposed to <eos> what is expected of <eos> this constellation of two <eos> oh it s what i want <eos> it s what i want <eos> it s what i like <eos> it s what i

still shivers inside <eos> all the breathing <eos> from your mouth through mine <eos> about how long <eos> theres hunger for one more time <eos> lover of mine when i kissed you <eos> i felt so good tell this tale to me <eos> well i wont believe <eos> that im already here <eos> tell this tale to me <eos> no i wont believe <eos> that were already here <eos> oh love you covered my skin <eos> with your eyes as they found me <eos> i kissed you danced in your sand <eos> and fell into a never ending moment <eos> and the whisper from your mouth through mine <eos> with those words that gently filled my lungs <eos> lover of mine when im with you <eos> i forget how am i to being lonely <eos> living without you <eos> spend another day passing by you <eos> dont wanna know how it feels if i do <eos> tell this tale to me <eos> no i wont believe <eos> that im already here <eos> tell this tale to me <eos> i wont believe <eos> that were already here some say its destiny <eos> whether triumph or tragedy <eos> but i believe we cast our nets out on the sea <eos> and nothing we gather comes for free <eos> i would have paid down through the years <eos> a price beyong rubies beyond tears <eos> to keep you safe with me <eos> but your suspicion and your fear <eos> your vow to let nobody near <eos> was your trinity such a tragedy <eos> copy paste is a sin always on the run is better <eos> i drew the best hand youd ever hold <eos> then cashed my winnings in long ago <eos> settled for silver how could i know <eos> you were waiting with the gold <eos> i could have caused your heart to yield <eos> but i was only a disturbance in the field <eos> of your dreams <eos> and i will never see you cry <eos> you wont be with me when i die <eos> a waste of you and me <eos> a tragedy <eos> we took the wrong train to kingdom come now <eos> no more damage can be done baby <eos> its just what the world dont need <eos> its another stinkin tragedy <eos> thats how the story goes <eos> our chapters coming to a close <eos> we are history <eos> but i will always think of you <eos> every day until my days are through <eos> you made me believe <eos> in tragedy <eos> in tragedy the ones that i can never overcome <eos> i want to be someone you can lay your weight upon <eos> someone whos saves you someone who holds on <eos> daring to love <eos> oh love <eos> la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> and come alive <eos> alive <eos> la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> i can be your heroine <eos> if someone lends a hand to hold my heart <eos> this heaving pounding sound i am carrying <eos> it leads me straight it makes me fall apart <eos> daring to love <eos> oh love <eos> la la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> and come alive <eos> alive <eos> la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> but most of all to be loved <eos> i will fail to take the easy way out <eos> i will tell the truth one more time <eos> even though it hurts even though i stay in the sheets we have on <eos> i will take a step on the densest darkest ground <eos> daring to love <eos> oh love <eos> la la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> and come alive <eos> alive <eos> la la la la la la la la la la laa <eos> but most of all to be loved when i go dont cry for me <eos> in my fathers arms ill be <eos> the wounds this world left on my soul <eos> will all be healed and ill be whole <eos> sun and moon will be replaced <eos> with the light of jesus face <eos> and i will not be ashamed <eos> for my savior knows my name <eos> it dont matter where you bury me <eos> ill be home and ill be free <eos> it dont matter anywhere i lay <eos> all my tears be washed away <eos> gold and silver blind the eye <eos> temporary riches lie <eos> come and eat from heavens store <eos> come and drink and thirst no more <eos> so weep not for me my friend <eos> when my time below does end <eos> for my life belongs to him <eos> who will raise the dead again <eos> it dont matter where you bury me <eos> ill be home and ill be free <eos> it dont matter anywhere i lay <eos> all my tears be washed away <eos> all my tears be washed away crawfish <eos> well i went to the bayou just last night <eos> there was no moon but the stars were bright <eos> put a big long hook on a big long pole <eos> and i pulled mr crawfish out of his hole <eos> crawfish <eos> see i got him see the size <eos> stripped and cleaned before your eyes <eos> sweet meat look fresh and ready to cook <eos> crawfish <eos> now take mr crawfish in your hand <eos> hes gonna look good in your frying pan <eos> if you fry him crisp or you boil him right <eos> hell be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite <eos> crawfish when theres so much darkness closing in <eos> just swerve around slowly <eos> youll find an opening <eos> a light will appear like an animal between the trees <eos> there youll find your pocket of peace <eos> make a perfect circle its all around you <eos> put your mark on the map anywhere or nowhere <eos> its up to you its not too late to find an opening <eos> trace a track until you find the end <eos> theres a clearing in every forest at least one for every man <eos> the light will appear like an animal between the trees <eos> there youll find your pocket of peace <eos> make a perfect circle its all around you <eos> you know that everything lingers for you to follow through <eos> its up to you <eos> its not too late to find an opening <eos> do you wanna rediscover or do you want it all to be over <eos> do you want to see the meaning of the circleing por la blanda arena que lame el mar <eos> su pequea huella no vuelve mas <eos> un sendero solo de pena y silencio llego <eos> hasta el agua profunda <eos> un sendero solo de penas mudas llego <eos> hasta la espuma <eos> sabe dios que angustia te acompao <eos> que dolores viejos callo tu voz <eos> para recostarte arrullada en el canto <eos> de las caracolas marinas <eos> la cancion que canta en el fondo oscuro del mar <eos> la caracola <eos> te vas alfonsina con tu soledad <eos> que poemas nuevos fuiste a buscar <eos> una voz antigua de viento y de sal <eos> te requiebra el alma y la esta llevando <eos> y te vas hacia alla como en sueos <eos> dormida alfonsina vestida de mar <eos> cinco sirenitas te llevaran <eos> por caminos de algas y de coral <eos> y fosforecentes caballos marinos haran <eos> una ronda a tu lado <eos> y los habitantes del agua van a jugar <eos> pronto a tu lado <eos> bajame la lampara un poco mas <eos> dejame que duerma nodriza en paz <eos> y si llama el no le digas que estoy <eos> dile que alfonsina no vuelve <eos> y si llama el no le digas nunca que estoy <eos> di que me he ido <eos> te vas alfonsina con tu soledad <eos> que poemas nuevos fuiste a buscar <eos> una voz antigua de viento y de sal <eos> te requiebra el alma y la esta llevando <eos> y te vas hacia alla como en sueos <eos> dormida alfonsina vestida de mar oh love <eos> right from the start <eos> you were old love <eos> like weve never

your way into my bones my joints <eos> into my veins <eos> like an animal you coiled your darkness around me <eos> you spelled your name in charcoal <eos> all over my body <eos> but these days <eos> i just walk with you <eos> these days <eos> i let you stay <eos> a little further away <eos> but i walk with you <eos> these days <eos> ill let you stay <eos> there were summer days and nights <eos> when i was blind to you <eos> you were quiet and you were still <eos> even when the moon was full <eos> my temporary state of lightness would scare me <eos> after all i was sure <eos> you were most wrong then i was daring <eos> but these days <eos> i just walk with you <eos> these days <eos> i let you stay <eos> these days <eos> i just talk with you <eos> these days <eos> i let you stay <eos> a little further away <eos> but i walk with you <eos> these days <eos> i let you stay <eos> the things youve shown me over the years <eos> the roads you blocked and how youll define me <eos> these days

<eos> there let her linger <eos> and listen like ever before <eos> leave her windows uncovered at night <eos> and fill her room with the city lights <eos> as they illuminate the sky <eos> it reminds her of the people outside <eos> cause she wont sleep <eos> unless she heals her loneliness <eos> walk with her <eos> beneath the tree tops <eos> create new paths and memories <eos> show her how the sunlight <eos> glances through the gaps between the leaves <eos> words help her change the world <eos> in only one verse <eos> tell her to reach for the stars <eos> and to always put love first <eos> leave her windows uncovered at night <eos> and fill her room with the city lights <eos> as they illuminate the sky <eos> it reminds her of the people outside <eos> it reminds her of the people <eos> it reminds her of the people <eos> it reminds her of the people outside do you remember the late morning <eos> when we went back to bed <eos> when we found the first position <eos> and every muscle rested <eos> i do remember that i already <eos> knew it was the last time <eos> the last time for first positions <eos> the last time youll be mine <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> do you remember the scars i showed you <eos> the stories i told you <eos> how i always said forever <eos> when you aksed me to stay true <eos> do you remember when we forgot <eos> how to smile at each other <eos> to believe that the other <eos> want only whats good for you <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> aaaaoo aoo aoo ao <eos> do you remember the late morning <eos> when we went back to bed <eos> when we found the first position <eos> and every muscle rested <eos> i do remember that i already <eos> knew it was the last time <eos> the last time for first positions <eos> the last time youll be mine i wish i had one last try <eos> hidden somewhere inside <eos> but its all been spend before <eos> when i reach for it i can sense it in my hand <eos> and when i try to grasp it <eos> its like sand or water <eos> through my hopeful fingers <eos> this just wont hold hold <eos> this just wont hold hold <eos> theres something so halffull about us <eos> we get so little but what we get it tastes so much <eos> were always longing for more <eos> is this the end of the thread <eos> the thread that led me to lose my head <eos> over something that started with wonder <eos> this just wont hold hold hold hold <eos> and even if a butterfly lives a hundred years <eos> or the stream of water turns around in the rivers <eos> you and me well still be the same <eos> you and me you and me you and me <eos> well be the same i walked into love <eos> i walked into a minefield i never heard of <eos> i walked into love <eos> i walked into a minefield i never heard of <eos> her remains were spread out like the pieces of a puzzle <eos> it took her three hundred and sixty five days putting them together <eos> the pieces were quite difficult to distinguish from each other <eos> they were tiny and the clear blue sky went on forever <eos> clearly the corners were an easy start <eos> that was when everyone was still helping me out <eos> when it was time to fill in the frames they left <eos> they thought i ought to have gotten over you by then <eos> her remains were spread out like the pieces of a puzzle <eos> it took her three hundred and sixty five days putting them together <eos> the pieces were quite difficult to distinguish from each other <eos> they were tiny and the clear blue sky went on forever <eos> i wouldnt do that to you <eos> i wouldnt do that to you <eos> i wouldnt do that to you <eos> i wouldnt do that to you <eos> i walked into love <eos> i walked into a minefield i never heard of <eos> i walked into love <eos> i walked into a minefield i never heard of <eos> i never heard of its like im walking on the moon <eos> its all new its all new <eos> its like im entering a pitch black room <eos> its all new its all new <eos> its like a seethrough thing that dont smell dont stink <eos> its all new its all new <eos> its when i let the truth in let it all begin <eos> its all new its all new <eos> though the shape of a heart is always the same <eos> you can never be sure it fits your frame so you did it again <eos> i guess youve done this before <eos> a little kissin and a lovin <eos> and your best judgment <eos> just lying on the floor <eos> just lying on the floor <eos> so you did it once more <eos> i guess you closed your eyes <eos> your heartbeat ringin in your ears <eos> your fingers through his hair <eos> oh why oh why oh why i look in the mirror and <eos> im weaker than my reflection <eos> this image is all i seek <eos> as i restlessly wonder up a peak <eos> so i turned it off <eos> and on again <eos> just like the shifting lights <eos> of day and night in my door way <eos> and the memorys of every thing <eos> thats ever said en done <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on <eos> my another me makes me worry <eos> a shortens always destructiveness <eos> as i lie in my diary <eos> to justify the choices i make <eos> so i turned it off <eos> and on again <eos> just like the shifting lights <eos> of day and night in my door way <eos> an the memorys of everything <eos> thats ever said en done <eos> it makes is easier to leave it on <eos> it makes it easier to leave it on

so many things we need to change <eos> itd be too easy to let them overwhelm us <eos> itd be too easy to let things stay the same <eos> chorus <eos> am i safe here yes youre safe here <eos> am i needed here yes youre safe here <eos> verse <eos> they convinced us that this was not our problem <eos> none of our concern <eos> and then they chiselled and chiselled untill everything we loved and everything we earned was taken away we let them take it all away <eos> verse <eos> this is my country <eos> this is your country too <eos> there are so many things we need to change <eos> itd be too easy to let it overwhelm us <eos> itd be too easy to let things stay the same <eos> chorus <eos> am i safe here yes youre safe here <eos> am i needed here yes youre safe here <eos> refrain <eos> while we stood and argued <eos> about the cost of it <eos> look how we let it slip out the backdoor <eos> what was the price of what we lost <eos> verse <eos> you wont remember any of these meetings <eos> any of the things you did or did not own <eos> this is the part where we learn that love is <eos> not having to do this on your own <eos> verse <eos> this is my country <eos> this is your country too <eos> there are so many things we need to change <eos> itd be too easy to let it overwhelm us <eos> itd be too easy to let things stay the same <eos> chorus <eos> am i safe here yes youre safe here

mile and mile of road between us <eos> if space had weight wed be buried under stars <eos> sweet talking like in a street car named desire <eos> buried in the back of your parents car <eos> all the fake camera tourists have left <eos> with the margarita girls and dirty duddy kravitz tries to buy you a drink <eos> saying what youve done dont matter none <eos> if youve never stopped and tried to think this indian girl walks out into traffic <eos> the traffic stops then shes causing havoc and <eos> then roll up the windows dial the cellphone <eos> get the cops to get out here i just want to

<eos> calling you up this drunk to say <eos> this will be the last time the very very last time i call to say <eos> o how the cops knew to wonder when wondering was dead <eos> because it was already said and done <eos> it had all been said and done before <eos> there was a tv pilot that addressed this same issue <eos> when arnold said to willis only the truth will set you free <eos> youre just a joke till someone stands up and says <eos> i love you enough to know set myself free <eos> hold yourself still when liz put the song on <eos> repeat again im not sure why <eos> its not like shes

we lost in the fire <eos> all the things we lost in the flood <eos> broke down old exposed <eos> those things only took they never gave any love <eos> sleepy headed so lost in your compass <eos> so much so that up was down <eos> all the tricks addictions and distractions <eos> that keep your light turned down low <eos> we wont be remembered <eos> for how low we hung our heads <eos> we wont be remembered <eos> for the things we never said <eos> mixed tapes the bad reviews <eos> the naked pictures i took of you <eos> old keys to older doors <eos> anchors to the things we adored light broke in africville <eos> all the mothers took their children out so far away <eos> down by the boats where you said i need you the most <eos> and young lovers walk hand in hand <eos> the beaches boardwalk oceans and sand and she says <eos> do you love and he says yes i love indeed <eos> blood carries love rages like a storm <eos> holds you throws you without warning <eos> it meant nothing to you then <eos> it means nothing to you now <eos> if youre leaving dont you dare leave me now <eos> in africville <eos> young lovers walk hand in hand <eos> beach and the boardwalk and ocean sand <eos> they say do you love and they say yes i love indeed <eos> letters sent letters received <eos> one for you and one for me <eos> that said do you love and i said yes i love indeed <eos> blood carries love rages like a storm <eos> and it leads you out in life without any warning <eos> it meant nothing to you then <eos> it means nothing to you now <eos> if youre leaving dont you dare leave me now <eos> in africville they made you wait so lonely <eos> you felt like the waiting wore you out <eos> and the wearing down <eos> you felt like you were playing the whole part again <eos> they made arrangements for flowers and candles <eos> told you to stop asking saying why do you keep on saying again <eos> and im standing on top of you <eos> wondering how just which way it goes <eos> and wondering just how this is you and me <eos> establishing gravity pushing through and pushing <eos> pushing through february again <eos> and the car was left halfway between the accident and out of town <eos> you didnt mention it as you walked through the door <eos> why all the anger why all the telling <eos> this cant happen anymore verse <eos> im thinking about what you said <eos> as you walked out the door <eos> your words stuck in my head <eos> and theyre circling like birds and stars <eos> chorus <eos> you said <eos> my heart is no weapon in fact <eos> my heart is a gate <eos> my heart is open and unafraid <eos> and its waiting for <eos> you to find your way in <eos> verse <eos> when were old <eos> will you lean into <eos> the open mouth kiss offered to you <eos> on the porch swing <eos> under a blanket of stars <eos> chorus <eos> you said my heart is no weapon <eos> my heart is a gate <eos> my heart is open <eos> my heart is afraid <eos> refrain <eos> does this love know enough to bend low into the winds <eos> does this love know its even love at all <eos> whats to say tha this love wont fail like others before it <eos> i say stop too many questions to pile onto one little song <eos> repeat

<eos> with a song <eos> the truth was contained was in a photograph <eos> that you held and kept to the light <eos> its true that you do what everybody wants you to <eos> but it doesnt make feel more right <eos> and its all you can take i can tell <eos> youre near the breaking point <eos> and it was the picture of you <eos> that got us through and i need you to know that <eos> lemons and lemonade

in heads held low <eos> talked for a bit shuffled outside <eos> we closed the curtains held each other and cried <eos> said hello at the same time we said goodbye <eos> smallest and wingless <eos> leaving as soon as you arrived <eos> sadness is just love wasted <eos> with no little heart to place it inside <eos> we closed the curtains held each other and cried <eos> said hello at the same time we said goodbye fraying of threads reminds how memory fades <eos> terrible how predictable the monkeys we became <eos> things we forget then learn again each day <eos> write it sing it paint it so that no can take it away from you <eos> is where you lay your head where you lay your heart <eos> terrible fires that we started <eos> all fears were quieted <eos> all things made possible <eos> with woman as bridge <eos> are you waiting for the world <eos> or are you closed to it <eos> are you waiting for the world <eos> are you open to it <eos> bridge over my body bed as abyss <eos> tangling of legs climbing hips <eos> sweetest fruit tasted in a kiss <eos> all fears were quieted <eos> all things made possible <eos> with woman as bridge <eos> find whatever piece of happiness you can find and hold onto it <eos> find whatever piece of happiness you can find and hold onto it <eos> woman as bridge woman as well <eos> two trees anchored standing tall <eos> space for mystery why dont we hold still until the cops drive by <eos> they dont care about us they couldnt care less about you or i <eos> all the way home the quietness and the radio played on <eos> filled in the blanks with sound <eos> maybe you were right <eos> when you said all the things inside of us <eos> that might be seen as ugly <eos> could very well be the most beautiful <eos> and then the song stops lights fade black <eos> talking comes and the talking goes <eos> and it raises itself out <eos> how many times do we need to talk about this thing <eos> it makes itself so apparent in everything <eos> maybe you were right <eos> when you said all the things inside of us <eos> hat might be seen as ugly <eos> could very well be the most beautiful trouble on the floor trouble on the floor <eos> everybody knows what youre coming here for <eos> i dont think you know much about this <eos> trouble on the ground trouble all around <eos> everybody says its the same old thing <eos> i dont know know anything about anything <eos> oh and how it grew on you and everything around <eos> everybodys singing out loud and i dont know if theyre singing the same note <eos> hey whats the deal again <eos> hey whats the deal with ray <eos> shoulder the love shout love and everybody says from the lord above <eos> psalm prayer jawlock when heaven lets go <eos> oh and how did you know that everybody sent away <eos> leaving everything they all knew it <eos> theyre coming back late saturday <eos> hey whats the deal again <eos> hey whats the deal with ray <eos> trouble on the floor trouble on the floor i had this dream where you holed up in guelph <eos> made a life above the albion hotel <eos> hard to say if the angels had come <eos> or if youd just come undone again <eos> troubles piled problems grew <eos> it was hardly ever me or hardly ever you <eos> and i dont know what to do <eos> do you know what to do about <eos> do about <eos> dont tell me were trying no one is trying here <eos> an awful ending to an otherwise perfect year <eos> the couple downstairs always fight <eos> ones always wrong ones always right <eos> i dont know who is who <eos> do you know do you know about verse <eos> big news burst over frequencies <eos> saying peril cest tout cest le fin <eos> talking heads assessed best outcomes <eos> in the end all agreed things would end bad <eos> verse <eos> she said im sick of your cleverness <eos> spat fencesitter but id lost the thread <eos> she said im leaving you tonight i mean it <eos> im leaving with quebec <eos> verse <eos> im leaving california <eos> detroit halifax <eos> im leaving all of you <eos> so you cant leave me back <eos> chorus <eos> on what we later learned was <eos> the very last night of the end of the world <eos> if this is all you get how will it be spent <eos> ashamed or alone angry drunk <eos> shouting blame or maybe <eos> or better spent <eos> fearless joyous kissing <eos> laughing dancing <eos> holding onto hope as long as hope can be held onto <eos> verse <eos> its your last little lie your last cigarette <eos> your last sip of alcohol a love songs pirouette <eos> the you the song gets sung to <eos> with imploring convincing hands

<eos> to sort it all out and push it into a song <eos> and im the boy who sat in the back <eos> i am the boy whod walk you home <eos> i am the secret admirer the unsigned poem <eos> i could be the lion to your dragon <eos> the river to your ocean <eos> moon stuck in your sky <eos> the calm to your commotion <eos> as long as i can be me one night in sudbury ontario <eos> a drunk approached the stage <eos> full of rage drunk up on his rage <eos> he said me and my girl we want to dance slow <eos> so why dont you sing some songs we know <eos> like maybe maybe stompin tom <eos> we played the

but were angry now and yelling now <eos> were not hearing anything <eos> that the other person is saying at all <eos> one night in sudbury ontario <eos> one night in riviere du loup <eos> i looked out through the smoke and swore i saw you <eos> too many nights <eos> too many drinks <eos> too many times <eos> where i didnt think of you <eos> i didnt think of you <eos> hey hey whats the deal <eos> this was supposed to be the real thing <eos> but were angry now and yelling now <eos> were not hearing anything <eos> that the other person is saying at all o what is this feeling that were feeling <eos> that makes me feel so small <eos> makes me feel like you dont <eos> you dont need dont need me at all <eos> o and who am i to you <eos> just a collection of expressions <eos> old and angry sentiments <eos> washed away washed away with time <eos> where do you keep your ghosts <eos> wrapped up in guards and tresses <eos> secret and smoky pretensions <eos> that say i need i need you <eos> o what is this feeling that were feeling <eos> that makes me feel so small <eos> makes me feel like you dont <eos> you dont need dont need me at all talking and talking in circles again <eos> weve talked about this before <eos> and in the way that your mouth shapes the words <eos> i could hear them a hundred times more <eos> turn off the tv and shut off the phone <eos> pretend were not broken that were alone <eos> and all of the parts the parts that werent good <eos> were all of the parts that we misunderstood <eos> dance just like nobodys watching <eos> me im as proud of you as i am <eos> im proud of pierres famous finger <eos> standing up tall with feet firm in air <eos> im as proud of you as i am <eos> turn off the tv and shut off the phone <eos> pretend were not broken that were

<eos> on the land by the ocean where the plane had dropped <eos> and i try to talk about it now because i couldnt say it then <eos> the truth of it is no one had slept for days <eos> and likely wouldnt for days still <eos> and its said more to explain than excuse <eos> why does the nurse just come and the nurse just leave <eos> i dont know if she believes in whats going on <eos> you say i will say all the things you want to say <eos> instead of saying all the things youre supposed to say <eos> the tourists came with their tourist smile <eos> and not having been there there wasnt much to say and they left <eos> with a smile you said send them on <eos> and the tourist light a cigarette he said right now im full of regrets <eos> and i wondered if thats the truth of touring <eos> maybe tourists always tour around looking for something that cant be found <eos> in their process of touring <eos> why do i do all the things that i do <eos> instead of doing the things that i want to do <eos> the truth of it is no one had slept for days <eos> and likely wouldnt for days still <eos> and its sad more to explain than excuse at the house with dan and dad cath and suze and liz and grams <eos> all of us fight over nothing again <eos> accident car came by picked us all up took us on a ride <eos> you stayed back with the dogs inside <eos> love fills the room up like lead balloons <eos> we laugh until we cry ourselves into bed with you <eos> if all the stars are promises theyve all gone and left the bed <eos> and tonight theres no light with you <eos> if all the stars should disappear <eos> just to make the darkness clear <eos> then tonight theres no light left with you <eos> without you <eos> up in bed over soda pop you said life is grand and doesnt stop <eos> im not leaving only going for awhile <eos> the trouble with singers and songs <eos> is more often than not they get it all wrong <eos> dont you dare get it wrong <eos> love fills the room up like lead balloons <eos> we laugh until we cry ourselves into bed with you <eos> if all the stars are promises theyve all gone and left the bed <eos> and tonight theres no light with you <eos> if all the stars should disappear <eos> just to make the darkness near <eos> then tonight theres no light left with you <eos> without you the bus stopped in brandon miles from ithaca <eos> at a shop that paid it to pour all the people out <eos> to drink all the coffee and read through the papers <eos> about the famous coming out <eos> the couple two rows up to the left didnt move <eos> as i passed they just lay sleeping in <eos> into one another like the way birds cluster <eos> all together when facing wind <eos> she was like a camera he a bfilm <eos> both pretty faced but hard <eos> from smoking too much and waiting too long <eos> and from all the things that life does to break your heart <eos> i told you so dont say i didnt tell you so <eos> i listened to them all the way westbound <eos> under gold blankets and blue fields <eos> with the sallyann jackets and pillows and backpacks <eos> she turned into him like a shield <eos> from the stories of santa claus drunk stuck in the chimney <eos> and the deer they lost making him fly <eos> how bb king rode the bus to the gig cause he was broke <eos> and how sometimes its ok to cry <eos> i hear it rains here all the time she said <eos> first thing well take a room to keep dry <eos> well find a bed and put us in it <eos> itll feel like home in no time <eos> what if theres not much more of this <eos> well id like to share it with you <eos> with your hundred and my hundred dollars <eos> im sure well pull through <eos> i told you so dont say i didnt tell you so lonely at the only <eos> clawing through the smoke <eos> where the poets are so hip <eos> they dont even write poems <eos> and its lonely at the only nights out of three <eos> its not that ive been crying just that my eyes leak <eos> if i knew what was wrong id let you know <eos> buy

the water came <eos> do you remember when the flood <eos> filled the cellars up with water covered windows up in mud <eos> and its lonely at the only nights out of three <eos> its not that ive been crying just that my eyes leak <eos> lonely at the only <eos> clawing through the smoke <eos> its so hard to even know <eos> if i knew what was wrong id let you know <eos> buy me a drink its no good to drink alone i keep recalling us at the airport <eos> saying good night for the last time me <eos> i managed a smile as you made nervous <eos> say hey hey never mind <eos> every song sounds like a love

the fork <eos> in the paths we had chosen <eos> has made it too easy to open gate <eos> i know <eos> the deeper it goes <eos> the deeper it goes <eos> the more it unfolds <eos> i get further from ever getting far away <eos> the deeper it goes <eos> the deeper it goes <eos> the lies that were told <eos> i get lost in the storm of the hell i made v <eos> spend your dollars <eos> spend your pounds <eos> we sleep it off and make our rounds <eos> i followed you around the world <eos> through every city every town <eos> but how much longer <eos> ch <eos> see theres aiming the gun <eos> and theres pulling the trigger <eos> you can say what you want <eos> but you know that theres a difference <eos> v <eos> we meet with smiles <eos> part with cries <eos> we board a plane and dry our eyes <eos> the hands create a disconnect <eos> it breaks through bonds and takes our eyes <eos> and the obligation is not yours <eos> when winter ends and we head north <eos> youve kept the breath inside our lungs <eos> and we stood up on your supports <eos> but now no longer <eos> ch <eos> see theres aiming the gun <eos> and theres pulling the trigger <eos> you can say what you want <eos> but you know that theres a difference <eos> and you are not your mom <eos> and i am not my father <eos> but if we dont have the time <eos> i suppose that its no bother <eos> no its no bother v <eos> just wait and itll creep in <eos> sit an hour <eos> sip your glass <eos> and slowly let it begin <eos> this time <eos> dont you think well be fine <eos> i cannot tell if its your eyes that have changed <eos> youve always seen right through me <eos> but its never felt strange <eos> until now <eos> while the room spins around <eos> ch <eos> i try breathing in <eos> breathing out <eos> but its still no good <eos> close my eyes <eos> and block out the sound <eos> but its still no good <eos> your face begins to change <eos> and the room is rearranged <eos> i heard the things youve said <eos> but your voice is not the same <eos> ive been here before but i wont come back again <eos> old friend <eos> its time to find my way out <eos> time to find my way out <eos> v <eos> i can feel us sinking <eos> the lights have got so dim <eos> and i am running out of reasons <eos> its time <eos> i didnt think that youd mind <eos> we got used to being so lonely right <eos> br <eos> fix eyes <eos> walk straight <eos> dont look lost <eos> tune out <eos> talk shit <eos> take them all <eos> duck down <eos> dont blink <eos> shell be cross <eos> were cool <eos> keep calm <eos> casket calls <eos> ch <eos> i try breathing in <eos> breathing out <eos> but its still no good <eos> close my eyes <eos> and block out the sound <eos> but its still no good <eos> your face begins to change <eos> and the room is rearranged <eos> i heard the things youve said <eos> but your voice is not the same <eos> ive been here before but i wont come back again <eos> old friend <eos> its time to find my way out <eos> time to find my way out v <eos> sweet as our slumber <eos> sharp like an ax <eos> can you remember <eos> how good what we had <eos> you cant tell me you dont mean to <eos> and i cant act like this is right <eos> the game we play has gotten oh so see through <eos> but at the end of the day whats one more night <eos> ch <eos> so i watch my back <eos> whenever you are not at my front <eos> brace for attack <eos> cuz i never really know what you want <eos> but when the lights go down <eos> its a torture that i cannot resist <eos> i should turn around <eos> but i suppose i could stay if you insist <eos> v <eos> comes faster than falling <eos> and it leaves like a ghost <eos> so lovely so haunting <eos> my poisonous host <eos> you cant tell me you dont love it <eos> and id be lying if i said i mind <eos> i could pretend that i am above it <eos> but at the end of the day whats one more time <eos> br <eos> i can play your fool <eos> its such a small price to pay <eos> let me break your rules <eos> i promise you wont complain from the stained glass window to the back of the room <eos> sun spread like the last bit of butter <eos> shading the corners it flattered the room and i stare at jesus mother <eos> though i cant remember how i got here last night <eos> by the lords will i am not in the gutter <eos> tangerine florescent clouds fill the sky <eos> and black filled the time to the present <eos> thank god for old ladies and these highway churches <eos> see highlights of dark nights uncovered <eos> i wish i could tell them with words made of gold <eos> but i stare at jesuss mother <eos> grandma through the screen door and the daisies of blue <eos> as the pool light turn off with the summer <eos> me and my brother in the cool waters touch <eos> and i stare at jesuss mother <eos> sometimes i feel distant as i drift through this word <eos> like the birds shadow glides cross the pavement <eos> there is something in nothing and i know that for sure <eos> for i stare at jesuss mother <eos> hey i should not complain for its all bout the same <eos> there are lonely men all cross this nation <eos> some broadcast their billfold to to see a channel of love telephone lines running at an angle to the ground <eos> birds black silhouettes move and mingle love is found <eos> honey skys and the pink light dies <eos> a tall man and his asian bride <eos> fly on the moped <eos> through the night they ride <eos> through the night they ride <eos> the faucet pours warm water and i test it with my hand <eos> i look out at my daughter and she is loving a box of sand <eos> the water bends right through my hand sometimes this feels too hard <eos> i know i try and to list to fly <eos> you can only see so far <eos> you can only see so far <eos> ohh <eos> the great unknown <eos> it shines like a lava lamp sunken down into the snow <eos> as we dig for the muted glow farther down it goes <eos> so just let go <eos> somefolks squeeze life like a lemon till theres nothing left to hold <eos> just rindsour night driving by what they cant control <eos> two planets turn in tandem like brothers holding hands <eos> they live and burn in cycles as the universe expands <eos> always slowly parting welcome one and all <eos> im you see youve come <eos> for all the time your here i feel less lonely <eos> sometimes i wonder though the way you treat me so <eos> i will not stand to be taken for granted <eos> i miss the days you hug my leg <eos> but now youve grow and turn away <eos> i play this song youve heard so long you just cant hear it <eos> the tune rolls on theres something wrong i think you fear it <eos> but all the things i say and do <eos> never seemed so real to you <eos> oh all the things i say and do never seem so real to you <eos> by noon the shadow heal <eos> september summers real <eos> the fallen berries stain grey sidewalks <eos> and all my memories seem to be rolling <eos> into an endless tide forever growing <eos> i miss the days you hug my leg <eos> for now youve grow its hard to say <eos> i play this song youve heard so long you just cant hear it <eos> the tune rolls on theres something wrong i think you fear it <eos> and all the things i say and do <eos> never seem so real to you <eos> oh all the things i say and do never seem so real to you in the summer i watch with tv with my dads new wife <eos> i rode around on my moutian bike <eos> like the big backyard and the fallen tree <eos> the sun is cold and the summers free <eos> time is torn into a memory <eos> somethings we lose somethings we keep <eos> underwater hold my eyes to find my sisters leg <eos> i pinched her thigh and she kicked my face <eos> i broken nose and a shining sea <eos> i make a funny noise when i try to breathe <eos> time is torn into a memory <eos> somethings we lose somethings we keep <eos> i see you rolling with the clouds at night <eos> my mom drove fast to make it home by nine <eos> she said its time to go to bed and i turned around and said <eos> mom i love suzzy greer <eos> auntie carla came down sunday with the tv guide <eos> like spaghetti night and spaghetti fries <eos> i big backyard and a fallen tree <eos> you change your clothes for the winter freeze <eos> time is torn into a memory <eos> somethings you lose somethings you keep <eos> i see you rolling with the clouds at night <eos> my mom drove fast to make it home by nine far up in the north <eos> the nights can be so dark <eos> biting cold takes its toll on the body <eos> grã½la casts her spell <eos> to the depths of the mind <eos> damaging happiness and the joy of life <eos> hope and faith dont you fail me now <eos> hope and faith come and warm my heart <eos> hope and faith fill me up with strength <eos> hope and faith shine down with bright light <eos> hope and faith give me back my joy <eos> hope and faith in the dark of night <eos> people waste their time with triviality <eos> leaving whats important for someone else <eos> my advice to you hide your head in the snow <eos> try forgetting everything <eos> the things you should know home im making my way home <eos> my minds already there <eos> yes my mind is <eos> light youre with me in the dark <eos> light my way at night <eos> let your light shine <eos> now this burden weighs me down <eos> the heaviest of weights <eos> knocks me to the ground <eos> right down to the <eos> dew that sparkles on the ground <eos> blue mountains loom above <eos> blue mountains loom <eos> and i walk alone one wish <eos> wont be forgotten <eos> never forget that <eos> long is the path ahead <eos> and though my body tires <eos> and i have far to go <eos> i know im going home <eos> know im going home <eos> know im going home <eos> know im going home <eos> know im going home <eos> home im making my way home <eos> my minds already there <eos> yes my mind is <eos> light youre with me in the dark <eos> light my way at night <eos> let your light shine <eos> now this burden weighs me down <eos> the heaviest of weights <eos> knocks me to the ground <eos> this burden weighs me down <eos> burden weighs me down <eos> burden weighs me down <eos> burden weighs me down i lift my mind to the sky <eos> and i let it take flight <eos> the wind carries to my ears <eos> precious sounds of life <eos> soon i break all ties <eos> which bind me to this earth <eos> all that surrounds me seems to melt <eos> into blue eternal <eos> higher higher <eos> far away <eos> and the glare of this world <eos> is small and humbled <eos> now the warmth of the sun <eos> has refreshed my soul <eos> she takes her leave and she bows <eos> to the dreams of the night <eos> this deepest sapphire <eos> this feast for open ears <eos> the clouds have drifted away <eos> and everything becomes so clear <eos> higher higher <eos> i must go <eos> and the glare of this world <eos> is small and humbled <eos> i lift my mind to the sky <eos> and i let it take flight <eos> the wind carries to my ears <eos> precious sounds of life <eos> soon i break all ties <eos> which bind me to this earth <eos> all that surrounds me seems to melt <eos> into blue eternal <eos> and later when <eos> the sun shines down <eos> deepest sapphire <eos> feast for the ears <eos> i lift my mind <eos> up to the sky <eos> look out over <eos> look out over <eos> look out over <eos> look out over <eos> look out over <eos> look out over gods of iron clashing wind in battle through the night <eos> tears will fall and strength is needed to overcome <eos> this old house is full of leaks and mold on the walls <eos> dragons of the mind are lurking in the shadows <eos> torrents wash away <eos> everything <eos> raindrops flowing all around <eos> queen takes king the pawns are falling onto the ground <eos> over you and me there is rising the pink moon <eos> merciless though the wind takes hold with freezing cold <eos> come my friend sit with me take council in the warmth <eos> torrents wash away <eos> everything <eos> raindrops flowing all around i am <eos> a soul i float amongst the fjords <eos> and i am creating fire which will find you <eos> your eyes i see the ocean deep in your eyes <eos> now i <eos> i know that nothing here can harm me now <eos> i rest inside the hope of odds to come <eos> then end up in harmony <eos> always please tell me who will fall and who has fallen <eos> who hides and wants to be forgotten <eos> my eyes i see the path now clearly to you <eos> now i <eos> i see the dream is now becoming true <eos> this well it overflows <eos> my hope my life <eos> then end up in harmony <eos> aaaahhhhhhhhhh <eos> aaaahhhhhhhhhh <eos> aah aah aaah aaaaaaahhhh <eos> i am <eos> a soul i float amongst the fjords <eos> and i am creating fire which will find you <eos> my eyes <eos> i see the path now clearly to you <eos> now i <eos> i see the dream is now becoming true <eos> this well it overflows <eos> my hope my life <eos> then end up in harmony <eos> aaaahhhhhhhhhh my bird flies home from afar <eos> brings the joy of spring to me <eos> oer the oceans endless blue <eos> he never fails <eos> his path is clear and true <eos> perched upon a branch of green <eos> he rests his legs from the long journey <eos> forms my heart with wondrous song <eos> i listen close <eos> he tells of battles won <eos> from my heart <eos> i thank you friend for these precious melody <eos> for these sweet and pure tones <eos> sweet and pure tone <eos> and the autumn comes again <eos> i ask you from my heart my friend <eos> that youd have me sing your song <eos> oh summer guest <eos> ill miss you while your gone <eos> from my heart i thank you friend <eos> for these precious melody <eos> for these sweet and pure tones <eos> sweet and pure tones <eos> you made a shelter for my soul <eos> if your language i could speak <eos> i would weave a song for you of my own you were my heart flower my poetry my song <eos> just one look at you and then i knew <eos> on that day serendipity smiled down on me <eos> time flew by swiftly life was filled with dance and song <eos> but it wasnt long before i learnt <eos> on that day you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> i still think about the possibility of love <eos> i see reflections of that moment now <eos> from that day just a fleeting glimpse that will not stay <eos> you were my heart flower my poetry my song <eos> but it wasnt long before i learnt <eos> on that day you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> you dont get to call the shots that way come take my hand lets jump through the knot of the past <eos> from the night where phantoms touch and tangle further deeper as the day is closing in <eos> soft and fragile there is grace in the dead of silence <eos> as we drink gentle hands are shaping further higher as the new day enters <eos> wont the mind run far away way ahead of us <eos> and everything that will be and for us here and now <eos> the old and the poor from the way we hadnt seen before <eos> and the reality that shields us and clothes us makes us happy for things the day can offer take these trembling hands <eos> touch these fingertips <eos> help them understand <eos> the silence on your lips <eos> when the steam rises from the ground <eos> levitating without a sound <eos> theres a peacefulness to be found <eos> in a breath that is skywards bound <eos> soothe this pain soothe this pain <eos> mend this broken voice <eos> ease these eager needs <eos> every little choice <eos> leads to fetile deeds <eos> light up when the night is worn <eos> opens up to an untouched morn <eos> x <eos> rest when these worried eyes <eos> melt away into open skies <eos> x <eos> take these trembling hands <eos> touch these fingertips <eos> help them understand <eos> the silence on your lips <eos> when the steam rises from the ground <eos> levitating without a sound <eos> theres a peacefulness to be found <eos> in a breath that is skywards bound glistening nighttime dew and she is walking with me <eos> from the house of red i hear a child crying <eos> foxes heading home their prey hangs from their jaws <eos> and the forest knows but it wont share the secret <eos> when the king takes sides <eos> leaving moral minds soldiers take their share <eos> nighthawks seem to sense that now is the time <eos> deep inside them burns the raging fire of life <eos> hell take back what he owns <eos> death cannot take hold if i can keep momentum <eos> fortresses of stone turn into crystal tears <eos> soothed by southern winds ive found my strength now <eos> and nobody knows and we must keep their secret <eos> when the king takes sides <eos> leaving moral minds soldiers take their share <eos> nighthawks seem to sense that now is the time <eos> deep inside them burns the raging fire of life <eos> hell take back what he owns billowing purple sea <eos> midnight dusks revelry <eos> now drift into the unknown <eos> and our currents unfold <eos> all this enchantment begins with your skin <eos> dont leave me in your wake <eos> tossed about looping ways <eos> take my hand take the oars <eos> propel me to your shore <eos> all this enchantment unfolds in my soul <eos> youre taking hold was there nothing but the hush of night <eos> had a boat dont remember where <eos> did you flee from what was said and seen <eos> truths not true under the light of lies <eos> raise your sword and shield <eos> was there more than just the prose of night <eos> had a grave dont remember where <eos> beaten down awhile i lift up my prayer <eos> broken promises have set the snare both sincere and not <eos> was there nothing but the blessed night <eos> had some gold but dont remember where <eos> when does faith lift up its head so high <eos> oh my lord wont you please tell me why faith bestows power <eos> was there nothing but the hush of night <eos> had a treasure but i dont know where <eos> did you flee from what was said and seen <eos> yes the good was not without the bad <eos> raise your sword and shield <eos> yes the good was not without the bad <eos> raise up your sword and shield you were my heart flower my poetry my song <eos> just one look at you and then i knew <eos> on that day serendipity smiled down on me <eos> time flew by swiftly life was filled with dance and song <eos> but it wasnt long before i learnt <eos> on that day you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> i still think about the possibility of love <eos> i see reflections of that moment now <eos> from that day just a fleeting glimpse that will not stay <eos> you were my heart flower my poetry my song <eos> but it wasnt long before i learnt <eos> on that day you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> you dont get to call the shots that way <eos> you dont get to call the shots that way i dragged that horse to water <eos> you know he wouldnt drink <eos> i shot him in the shallows <eos> before i had the time to think <eos> now im out here on foot <eos> still gotta cross the great divide <eos> im feeling awful lonesome <eos> wishing i still had a horse to ride <eos> come on now <eos> my daddy always told me not to play around with matches <eos> got me a hold of a flame thrower how that fire catches <eos> wouldnt you know it <eos> me and daddy and mama didnt have nowhere left to live <eos> i was quick to remind daddy though <eos> jesus preached we all should just forgive forgive forgive <eos> they took me to the river to get my spirit clean <eos> wouldnt you know it buddy like nothing youd ever seen <eos> that river spit me out <eos> and threw my bare ass right there up against the shore <eos> i swear it started raining blood and the thunder start to roar <eos> preacher screamed that boy got the devil in him lets burn him at the stake <eos> my mama jumped in front of me and told them all to wait <eos> she said my baby got the devil in him <eos> oh he got the good lord in him too <eos> she said my baby never hurt a fly <eos> but look what yall was about to do mama said now <eos> i dragged that horse to water <eos> that bastard wouldnt drink so <eos> i shot him in the shallows <eos> before i had the time to think <eos> now im out here on foot <eos> still gotta cross the great divide <eos> feeling awful lonesome wishing <eos> i still had that horse to ride <eos> now that im a grown man not as young as i once were <eos> reckon in my growing that i found myself a cure <eos> settle down take your time <eos> and try not to get caught up in all that haste <eos> but i reckon if it ever came to blows <eos> id still lay some fool to waste we were lost and set adrift <eos> on a red clay unmarked road <eos> with nothing cept what we could hold <eos> free of every debt we owed <eos> wed left behind our sorted pasts <eos> and all we had held dear <eos> wed dropped the sails and climbed the mast <eos> made a promise in the mirror feeling so inspired <eos> so breathe breathe it out lay your burdens down <eos> to rest <eos> breath through the doubts <eos> never let them get the best the best of you <eos> hey now look yonder darling whats that i see <eos> dont that scarecrow on the hillside <eos> look an awful lot like me <eos> with his arms all spread out wide <eos> like he was measuring the fields <eos> or was he out there standing guard <eos> over something long been concealed <eos> using his body as a shield <eos> or maybe hes more like jesus christ <eos> out there crucified <eos> for what he held inside his heart <eos> that he could no longer hide <eos> did it make him out a liar <eos> so breathe breathe it out <eos> lay your burdens down to rest <eos> breathe through the doubts <eos> never let them get the best the best of you there was nothing nothing left standing <eos> all the people and trees disappeared in the wrath of the sea <eos> in the night she crashed all around us <eos> like the quietest dance i was locked in my hands when i heard <eos> voices from the top of the mountain <eos> voices from the valley bellow <eos> i am ready to join them <eos> i am ready to go <eos> voices from the top of the mountains <eos> voices from the valley below <eos> i am ready to join them <eos> i am ready to go <eos> now the world outside is just blooming <eos> green as the green that was spilled on the hills and the leaves <eos> time will come when the water will open <eos> and the angels will cry just like the time before <eos> they were voices from the top of the mountain <eos> they were voices from the valley below <eos> i am ready to join them <eos> i am ready to go <eos> i am ready to join them <eos> i am ready to go <eos> i am ready to go <eos> i am ready to <eos> go something bout this mistress <eos> oh she stares right through your skin <eos> something bout this spoilt guacamole <eos> isnt she <eos> one for the greatest <eos> one for the greed <eos> one for the many men who deceive <eos> one for the geniuses and thieves <eos> i cant deny i cant deny <eos> that i fortified my lucid mind <eos> in search of

that flippy thing <eos> like that guy from that band can do <eos> some days you know <eos> im an emo kid nonconforming as can be <eos> youd be nonconforming too if you looked just like me <eos> i have paint on my nails and makeup on my face <eos> im almost emo enough to start shaving my legs <eos> cause i feel real deep when im dressing in drag <eos> i call it freedom of expression <eos> most just

and wear thick rimmed glasses <eos> i told my friends i bleed black and cry during classes <eos> im just a bad cheap imitation of goth <eos> you can read me "catcher in the rye" and watch me jack off

<eos> you want to look like divas but divas are skanks <eos> dating cooler older guys in high school grades <eos> if they were really that cool theyd get girls their own age <eos> but they cant so their on a cradle crusade <eos> cause statutory rapes the coolest way to get laid <eos> they dont want there bodies to be covered <eos> cause girls are getting sluttier younger <eos> there too young to be talking about sex <eos> and losing their virginity at recess <eos> buying push up bras you have to stuff to fill in <eos> and giving hand jobs on the bus during school field trips <eos> during dances moving like a tramp is your goal <eos> but you shouldnt wear revealing clothes if you have nothing to show <eos> christina or paris who do you idolize more <eos> while looking for a thong in a childrens size four <eos> getting good grades is not what youre dreaming of <eos> youd rather go on mtv and show them your nubs <eos> that cant handle the pressure their under <eos> so girls are getting sluttier younger <eos> i wish those jr highers would stop <eos> wearing shorts that barely cover their crotch <eos> youre mature enough to start smoking weed <eos> wasnt it just last week you were watching disney <eos> now its the hottest whores on e <eos> so you can take notes on how to act like tara reid <eos> step get drunk and act real dumb <eos> step common sense makes life less fun <eos> step the best way to get accepted <eos> is to put out and become anorexic <eos> i dont understand so i wonder <eos> why girls are getting sluttier younger <eos> they take their childhood and discard it <eos> are they nave or just retarted i dont know i try to process these feelings but get "does not compute" <eos> i tried to multiply our love but you took the square root <eos> whenever i see you i dont know what to say <eos> its like my mind goes from dsl to k <eos> ive looked for girls online but cant get any play <eos> now im forced to get off to japanese anime <eos> we would stay up late playing dungeons and dragons <eos> you can be my sam and ill be your frodo baggins <eos> for the last time they are not gay <eos> oh yeah right <eos> they were just really good friends <eos> if smeagol wasnt there they wouldve been all over each other <eos> shut up you didnt read the book <eos> im just a nerd in love but i dont know what to do <eos> its hard to get a girl when your weight is lower than your iq <eos> maybe shell look past the headgear and all of my acne <eos> i still think shes leet but she doesnt notice me <eos> i can be hans solo and you can be leia <eos> if i was less like screech and more like ac slater <eos> youre the only girl that makes my floppy disk hard <eos> i can hack in a mainframe but not in your heart <eos> if i could be with you id treat you with kindness <eos> and protect you from harm like norton antivirus <eos> but you are like hollywood and im like bit torrent <eos> my love for you is steady like gravitational constants <eos> that doesnt really rhyme <eos> oh yeah like leia and slater does <eos> well at least i didnt dress up like yoda at my star trek themed birthday party <eos> well i was years old <eos> shut up you are such a nerd <eos> im just a nerd in love and i feel out of place <eos> ill have to specialize in gynecology so i can get to nd base <eos> unless she finds sarcasm appealing and greasy hair sexy <eos> i still think shes leet but she doesnt notice me <eos> i want to be with girl and not get any rejection <eos> who will dress like a hot alien at star trek conventions <eos> whos as precious to me as a rare pokemon <eos> and who knows the difference between and a warlock and a shaman <eos> but were just nerds in love realitys too far gone <eos> cause were too much like steve urkel and not enough like stefan <eos> but one day well be ceos and have lots of money <eos> but until then our only friends will be our pcs dear diary <eos> mood apathetic <eos> my life is spiraling downward <eos> i couldnt

with a grin <eos> smilers never lose and frowners never win <eos> so let the sun shine in face it with a grin <eos> open up your heart and let the sun shine in <eos> when you are unhappy the devil wears a grin <eos> but oh he starts arunning when the light comes pouring in <eos> i know hell be unhappy cause ill never wear a frown <eos> maybe if we keep on smiling hell get tired of hangin around <eos> so let the sun shine in face it with a grin <eos> smilers never lose and frowners never win <eos> so let the sun shine in face it with a grin <eos> open up your heart and let the sun shine in <eos> if i forget to say my prayers the devil jumps with glee <eos> but he feels so awful awful when he sees me on my knees <eos> so if youre full of trouble and you never seem to win <eos> just open up your heart and let the sun shine in <eos> so let the sun shine in face it with a grin <eos> smilers never lose and frowners never win <eos> so let the sun shine in face it with a grin <eos> open up

that spins my head around my dampened underarms <eos> will you take a trip with me <eos> down a sunny stream afloating <eos> on a gooseneck boat <eos> and if you feel a rumbling in your stomach dear <eos> dont be scared to make a mess <eos> or ruin your new dress with me <eos> oh <eos> oh there she goes there she goes <eos> shes walking past me here i wonder if she knows <eos> where does she go <eos> that i do share the air <eos> that blows the bells she sings along without a care <eos> i hope her hands do find <eos> i hope her hands do find <eos> the folded feelings that i know i left behind <eos> that i left behind <eos> will you take a trip with me <eos> down a sunny stream afloating <eos> on a gooseneck boat <eos> and if you feel a rumbling in your stomach dear <eos> dont be scared to make a mess <eos> or ruin your new dress <eos> waiting for an apple to fall into my hands <eos> waiting seems to be the master plan <eos> smiling til it gets me stiff oh oh no <eos> will you

and ill follow you tonight ever since i was eight or nine <eos> ive been standing on the shoreline <eos> always waiting <eos> for something lasting <eos> loose your hunger you loose your way <eos> get confused and you fade away <eos> oh this town <eos> kills you when you are young <eos> oh this town <eos> kills you when you are young <eos> im not the boy i used to be <eos> this town has got the youth of me <eos> all eyes turn hollow <eos> from the work of sorrow <eos> standing on the paving <eos> by the office building <eos> theyve got so much to do <eos> never time for you <eos> we are shadows <eos> oh were shadows <eos> shadows in the alley <eos> you die when youre young <eos> you die when youre young <eos> you die when youre young mind made up id given all for you <eos> seeest la folie damour <eos> by now my mind is clear <eos> you planted all the fear <eos> doubts and despair and <eos> you keep my heart on the run <eos> im bound to fall in love with the one <eos> qui ne maime pas <eos> qui na pas besoin de moi <eos> so we planed a secret rendezvous <eos> toute la nuit chez moi <eos> soon confusion grew <eos> i sadly smiled for two <eos> his head went down <eos> he wore my heart like a crown <eos> ever since i fall for the one <eos> qui ne maime pas <eos> qui na pas besoin de moi <eos> qui ne maime pas <eos> qui na pas besoin de moi <eos> wall burnt down <eos> you never

love of any kind <eos> you have no one on your side <eos> fight your own troubled mind <eos> and no help to come by <eos> fight your own troubled mind <eos> all winter slept around until my heart fell asleep <eos> never had so much was afraid to keep <eos> first of april love of your life falls out of the blue <eos> falling for a bad joke you love to be the fool <eos> you have no one on your side <eos> fight your own troubled mind <eos> and no help to come by <eos> fight your own troubled mind <eos> so find love for tonight for all nights to come <eos> as long as your with someone and never

<eos> fight your own troubled mind lately youve been bothered by your friends <eos> we will disturb you to make you talk again <eos> try to find the other side of you <eos> the things you hide what you dont say <eos> we say no oh no <eos> we wont let you slip inbetween <eos> we say no oh no <eos> we wont let you squeeze right through <eos> give you second chances easily <eos> we wait for answers for hours and years <eos> but the sadness in your eyes wont go away <eos> it becomes you in a strange kind of way <eos> i wonder where you come from <eos> who youve been <eos> what you gain if you win <eos> but my guess is right you break like glass <eos> and i wonder where your god was then <eos> i say no oh no <eos> i wont let you slip inbetween <eos> i say no oh no <eos> i wont let you squeeze right through <eos> oh how sweet a girl like you can be <eos> when she tries <eos> youre changing skin like i change clothes <eos> youre faking it well but it shows <eos> you say lately ive been bothered by my friends <eos> they need foregiveness <eos> i need therapy they say <eos> better lock up well before they come <eos> with their prayers and loaded guns <eos> better lock up well before they come <eos> more than ten years to ignore what they here for <eos> we say no oh no <eos> we wont let you slip inbetween <eos> we say no oh no <eos> we wont let you squeeze right through <eos> we say no no no no <eos> since you fall from every throne leave the body leave the mind <eos> leave the body leave the mind <eos> every promise every place behind <eos> i just happen to feel so alone

sense <eos> by lack of time <eos> you just happen to be where everything feels fine <eos> its a new secret i have found <eos> from today ill change my priorities around <eos> im no longer in command and people say <eos> im off solid ground and youre to blame <eos> but they dont understand people never do <eos> its confusing i dont expect them to <eos> its a new secret i have found <eos> today must have been one of the strangest days <eos> i found a place where i could stay <eos> and people say that it will kill me <eos> but they dont understand <eos> people never do but it makes sense to me <eos> to be senseless to change my plans for you <eos> its a new secret i have found <eos> and im off solid grounds for you to be gone ep <eos> not the first time i saw you <eos> but i knew i want

time <eos> and when she wakes up she watches tv <eos> counting cracks in the ceiling <eos> no i dont know what shes thinking <eos> so i give up waiting for someone waiting <eos> talking to someone staring <eos> i never come around <eos> i never come around <eos> i left her fifteen years behind <eos> girls laying down <eos> never come around <eos> so much for girl staying <eos> in afraid of being needed <eos> and seen she watches <eos> the world on a screen <eos> shes distant <eos> and god knows i tried to leave her <eos> cause shes got a constant fever <eos> i let it slip my mind <eos> i never come around <eos> i never come around <eos> i left her fifteen years behind <eos> i know a girl laying down <eos> no i never wasted my time <eos> we have something in common <eos> shes as

the waiting awakes me <eos> and the voices of madness <eos> from my subconscious singing songs of sadness <eos> today is a good day <eos> today is a good day <eos> oh such a good day <eos> today is a good day <eos> today is a good day no i dont remember what brought us to this <eos> what places we blindly passed what turns we missed <eos> when things really mattered and we really cared <eos> when simply being was easy just having you there <eos> i was on a down slide wasting my days <eos> when i met you i came to such a lovely place <eos> we laughed and cried our way through <eos> the days and nights the weeks and months <eos> and all the seasons ups and downs <eos> remind me of how i used to feel <eos> remind me of who i used to be back when <eos> nothing could come between us then <eos> that thought would never leave us <eos> cause i dont remember love needles in the hay <eos> the life i knew by heart and lived everyday <eos> the secret codes and signs you and i eye to eye <eos> wake me up hurt me you have to <eos> i forgot how to cry <eos> remind me of how i used to feel <eos> remind me of who i used to be back when <eos> nothing could come between us then <eos> that thought would never leave us <eos> so remind me of how i used to feel <eos> remind me of who i used to be back when <eos> nothing could come between us then <eos> that thought would never leave us when <eos>

from madness <eos> love is the common name <eos> again they depend on the one to blame <eos> what can he say <eos> hes got that creepy feeling <eos> everyone they know says <eos> shes over him shes moving on <eos> how come she knows <eos> everything he does <eos> and every place he goes <eos> who could possibly save <eos> save them from madness <eos> love is the common name <eos> again they

off the road somewhere i dont know <eos> soon with you its gonna blow <eos> in your car for hours and days <eos> weeks and months windows rolled down <eos> pass small cities and big ones too <eos> i brought one promise not one for you <eos> we drive fast sunsets low <eos> wanna reach the sun before i get old <eos> deserts and fields and the pine trees <eos> music my father played me <eos> i was a child just like now <eos> i never once thought that feeling could die <eos> those days came and went <eos> then you get taken by life by accident <eos> and you wake up somewhere in the shade <eos> overloaded by what you made yourself <eos> have to get the things the ring a man a wing <eos> and smile when you dont win <eos> and i say off the road somewhere i dont know <eos> just as long as i feel it blow <eos> deserts and fields and the pine trees <eos> music my father played me <eos> when i was a child just like now <eos> i never once thought that feeling could die <eos> that feeling could die on the black sunday afternoon sun is pale like the moon <eos> when you look to the sky holy holy why <eos> all fades into blue on the black sunday afternoon <eos> no good time to walk alone on a bike riding home <eos> when you look to the sky holy holy why <eos> all fades into blue on the black sunday afternoon <eos> bad luck comes or just a car on the right side hears a call <eos> and sees a blackbird flying low above her head no mistletoe <eos> nothing really moves on black sunday afternoons <eos> you wake up in a water bed and on the back of your head <eos> a lump but just a tiny hole almost no light at all in here <eos> when you call you cant hear your own voice at all <eos> they gather up somethings wrong <eos> they ask around no one knows <eos> well have you been where the rivers cross by the water in the moss <eos> nothing really moves on black sunday afternoons <eos> sun is pale like the moon <eos> when you look to the sky holy holy holy holy why <eos> all fades into blue on black sunday afternoons fine white sheet and candles too <eos> beds in a straight row ones for you <eos> no one talks straight at you <eos> just outside in the hallway <eos> flowers in the window red and blue <eos> rose people here still think of you <eos> no bleeding eye when they pass <eos> dont bang your head against the glass <eos> chorus <eos> what can i do i am losing you <eos> what can i do i am losing you <eos> what can i do i am losing you <eos> what can i do i am losing you <eos> from the doorway watching you sleep <eos> before you wake up not when you eat <eos> keep it straight wipe your mouth <eos> keep it down rose dont shout <eos> chorus <eos> from the doorway watching you sleep <eos> before you wake up not when you eat <eos> keep it straight wipe your mouth <eos> keep it down rose dont shout <eos> chorus ill feel the fear for you ill cry your tears for you <eos> ill do anything i can to make you comfortable <eos> even if i fall down when youre not around

then theres me <eos> hopelessly trying to find a way <eos> of hearing three little words from your mouth <eos> and not filling this heaven with doubt <eos> humor me i know youve said it but <eos> say it again <eos> i wanna know that you mean it this time <eos> say it again <eos> i know that i should believe it <eos> but i <eos> never thought someone would love me like you say you do <eos> so say it again and ill say it back to you <eos> youre holding my heart in your hands <eos> and its the safest feeling ive had it cant be true <eos> someone like you feels this way for me <eos> i hear three little words from your mouth <eos> and my heart cant figure it out <eos> so humor me i know youve said it but <eos> just say it again <eos> i wanna know that you mean it this time <eos> say it again

wanna let you down <eos> ill give you all of my love <eos> to everything we dreamt about <eos> coming from a small town <eos> everything is big to me <eos> i guess im on my way now <eos> but so much left to see <eos> what a view <eos> lets make it come true <eos> every time the lights go out and the city sleeps <eos> im waiting for <eos> any little bit of something good something worth fighting for <eos> i dont wanna live regretting thinking i could have been more <eos> cause i care i care <eos> beautiful people happy getting by <eos> dont they wanna be more <eos> or are they by the time <eos> and now i see the city lights <eos> right outside my door <eos> they could never be to bright <eos> i couldnt ask for more <eos> every time the lights go out and the city sleeps <eos> im waiting for <eos> any little bit of something good something worth fighting for <eos> i dont wanna live regretting thinking i could have been more <eos> cause i care i care <eos> i care i care i care i care little did we know at the time <eos> we had so much of us still to find <eos> with our young and innocent minds <eos> so beautifully blind <eos> its a pretty rare happiness that we know <eos> and a pretty cold sadness if it goes <eos> the fear of falling too far away <eos> so out of reach that you cant catch me one day <eos> all this glitter and dust <eos> flying round the words in our mouths <eos> cant stay let it out yeah let it out <eos> everything and even nothing <eos> i feel your tears in my eyes <eos> looking out waiting for a chance <eos> to break let it out yeah let it out <eos> everything i need for nothing <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> is it just my own heavy head <eos> thats making me so cold in your bed <eos> i used to feel like nothing could touch us <eos> maybe you feel the same <eos> its a pretty rare happiness that we know <eos> and a pretty cold sadness if it goes <eos> the longer we pretend its alright <eos> well start exploding and be too weak to fight <eos> all this glitter and dust <eos> flying round the words in our mouths <eos> cant stay let it out let it out <eos> everything and even nothing <eos> i feel your tears in my eyes <eos> looking out waiting for a chance <eos> to break let it out you let it out <eos> everything and even nothing <eos> even if you think its nothing <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> oh

how i long to live inside a window <eos> by the sighing motorway <eos> feel the city searching for my loneliness <eos> in all the dust and glass <eos> reflections after jane <eos> and i see her all on a golden sunday <eos> with her hair so dark in the rain <eos> who is in the newspapers this month or week or year <eos> my silent friend <eos> i can starve my life into a deeper sleep <eos> remembering <eos> reflections after jane waking up on the floor <eos> i look around and no ones awake <eos> i cant do this anymore <eos> the girls the parties its all the same <eos> i used it to run away <eos> from the hurricanes in my mind <eos> but its finally time <eos> open the curtains let in some light <eos> all this time running away <eos> using these worthless things <eos> to run to hide <eos> to never realize <eos> what in life is truly important <eos> to make it through <eos> wake up wake up <eos> its time to fix this life <eos> this life is wearing on me <eos> being hungovers

drive <eos> be good or be gone <eos> be good or be be gone <eos> i have become an aerial view <eos> of a coastal town that you once knew <eos> be good or be gone <eos> be good or be be gone down here underneath the microscope <eos> its hard to cope <eos> dont hide your face in your hands <eos> cause if your eyes play tricks <eos> its outta my control <eos> its gonna be a long cold winter <eos> the skeletons of trees my blackwater child <eos> if you dont love me well dont shove me <eos> out into the dark <eos> without a flashlight or a spark <eos> any stitches cling like bitches to my arms <eos> for all my charms <eos> its gonna be a crooked little winter <eos> the skeletons of trees my blackwater child <eos> shes walking home <eos> to the devils flowers <eos> the broken bones <eos> of heavy hours <eos> we stayed out late <eos> its a lighthouse trait <eos> and well take our time i feel your sorrow chasing tomorrow <eos> there is no distance in your absence <eos> if you call the monsters they will appear <eos> like i disappear blackout <eos> there is resistance behind enemy lines <eos> there goes the hatred bursting through the fabric <eos> if you call the monsters they will appear <eos> like i disappear blackout <eos> you are here <eos> you are here <eos> you are here theyre biting at your heels <eos> country lanes lead to fields <eos> who was that fox caught in that trap <eos> laid with hunters map <eos> when the cloud rolls back back back <eos> ill meet you at the mill <eos> depressions in your neck <eos> hes just keeping you in check <eos> who was that fox caught in that trap <eos> laid with hunters map <eos> when the cloud rolls back back back <eos> ill meet you by the mill if you go away then <eos> dont you come back round here no more <eos> and if you make the move then <eos> dont expect to come home to an open door <eos> im not the same person i was a year ago <eos> you cut me deeply and the scars still show <eos> youve walked between the raindrops for far too long <eos> youre gonna get whats yours <eos> and if you go away then <eos> dont you come back round here no more <eos> im not the same person i was a year ago <eos> you cut me deeply and the scars still show if we put our heads together i think we can salvage it <eos> if we ride the stormy weather will we really benefit <eos> is there anything left to save now anyway <eos> when youre near my heart beats quicker faster <eos> its your skin as pale as alabaster <eos> it has to be it has to end <eos> losing a lover gaining a friend <eos> yesterday your virtue inspired me <eos> and yesterday you ignited the flames that burnt inside of me <eos> so why when i wake up today are the ashes about us <eos> now ive lost the strength to crush a flower <eos> and now i grow weaker with the passing hours <eos> you once was the fire you once was the glow <eos> i was so sure then and now i dont know <eos> ive wasted time away <eos> but i think that its ok cause <eos> ive wasted time away with you <eos> now look what weve built together <eos> we didnt waste anything <eos> weve built a fire that burns too strong to die <eos> or am i a liar who smothers the flames <eos> when youre near my heart beats quicker faster <eos> its your skin as pale as alabaster <eos> it has to be it has to end <eos> losing a lover lying to a friend <eos> ive wasted time away <eos> but i think that its ok cause <eos> ive wasted time away with you how will you ever learn <eos> when your hands are tied and your bridges burned <eos> when will you get to see that your only option lies with me <eos> must you be kicked right down ripped from limb <eos> taught to drown but told to swim <eos> the way to be the way to act is <eos> not to preach what you practice <eos> things change but a part of its present formula remains <eos> things neednt be so if you let me through <eos> things neednt be so if you let me through <eos> things neednt be so if you let me through <eos> it must be true he said i found you i dont have to be feeling down to speak of you <eos> but ill visit you not only when im feeling blue <eos> you make me happy when i was happy to start with <eos> you make my life so precious and so easy to part with <eos> life rolls along and teaches us nothing <eos> so why am i still around waiting for something <eos> do you have the answers to all of my questions <eos> maybe not but id like to hear your suggestions <eos> talk to me you dont talk to me <eos> talk to me you dont talk to me <eos> people in corridors people in doorways <eos> people wherever i turn <eos> so many people round out the shadows <eos> so many people to learn <eos> and to burn when i am sad and weary <eos> when all my hope is gone <eos> and i cant put my finger on the time things first went wrong <eos> i have a little secret i like to tell myself <eos> and until now i havent told anybody else <eos> you may not see things my way <eos> like my method or my reasons <eos> but you cant tell me that im wrong <eos> theres no heart you cant melt <eos> with a certain little smile <eos> and no challenge should be faced <eos> without a little charm and a lot of style <eos> so dont put your faith in time she heals but doesnt change <eos> and only a fool wont take the chance to stay the same <eos> when i am sad and weary <eos> when all my hope is gone <eos> i walk around my house and think of you with nothing on <eos> i have a list of things i go over in my mind <eos> when i can just sit right back and watch the world unwind <eos> you may not see things my way <eos> i dont care cause im not asking <eos> but you cant tell me that im wrong <eos> theres no heart you cant melt <eos> with a certain little smile <eos> and no challenge should be faced <eos> without a little charm and a lot of style <eos> so dont put your faith in time she heals but doesnt change <eos> and only a fool wont take the chance to stay the same <eos> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nothing i can do could ever bring those feelings back <eos> ive taken everything my body is a bloated sack <eos> the days behind me start rolling into months <eos> is time running out <eos> my head feels too heavy <eos> my legs feel too weak <eos> all i can do now is sleep <eos> everything is empty now the things i knew are gone <eos> darkness lays dormant now a colour once shone <eos> hope reminds my conscience just to get me through the day <eos> is this my reward <eos> and im going on journeys <eos> im exhausting my muse <eos> im taking from everything <eos> to see what i can use <eos> if i found a brand new color <eos> something noone had ever seen <eos> i dug it up right there in my garden <eos> that would be the greatest thing <eos> nothing i can do could ever bring those feelings back <eos> ive taken everything my body is a bloated sack <eos> the days behind me start rolling into months <eos> is time running out <eos> and faced with having to <eos> have and then lose <eos> id choose never to have had yeah <eos> if i found a brand new color <eos> something noone had ever seen <eos> i dug it up right there in my garden <eos> that would be the greatest thing <eos> i only want to speak to you <eos> i only want to let you know <eos> that time and again my feelings <eos> never seem to show <eos> if i found a brand new color <eos> something noone had ever seen <eos> i dug it up right there in my garden <eos> that would be the greatest thing <eos> time and again repeat you left me unguided <eos> you left me divided with room to complain <eos> so ill say in this song the wait is too long <eos> i thought i had seen it i thought i had learned <eos> theres something around each corner i turn <eos> cant stay still forever got to get it together <eos> if youd seen with these eyes and lived with these lies <eos> i thought about father and i thought about here <eos> and i knew that this wasnt for me <eos> now the beast can subside a boy neednt hide <eos> oh if youd seen with these eyes <eos> never dares to sow on and on she goes <eos> knowing what she knows ã¢ nothing <eos> majors whipping boy facing one old toy <eos> distance through the void ã¢ nothing god knows ive tried to bridge the gap <eos> ive tried to be me and time after time ive lied <eos> just to say the things you wanted to hear <eos> look look what ive done look what i do <eos> im starting to pull myself through <eos> hell could feasibly freeze but in your eyes ill always be <eos> the fountainhead the boy whose thoughts keep running away <eos> and you know im right <eos> wasnt it you who said <eos> that when looking to open the eyes in my head <eos> and now i can see from your mistakes <eos> youre as blind as me <eos> god knows ive tried god knows i try <eos> to be something more than i am <eos> hell could feasibly freeze but in your eyes ill always be <eos> the fountainhead the boy whose thoughts keep running away <eos> and you know im right <eos> what can i say about being a fount <eos> its a game that we play it goes round and around <eos> i shall stick to the rules but i wont suffer fools <eos> and i wont lose the plot and i wont lose my cool <eos> cant you see what ive done cant you see what i do <eos> its not really unique and its hopelessly crude <eos> but these are my decisions these are my mistakes <eos> and ill fall down again if thats what it takes seems like youre always a million miles away <eos> as far as im concerned thats where you can stay <eos> but all the time im reminded <eos> used to be a time we had a lot in common <eos> but now as far as i can see you got something coming <eos> and all the time youre behind me <eos> and all the time you remind me <eos> of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug <eos> salt upon a bubbling slug <eos> you say i can talk to you any time <eos> but i just want to cut some rug <eos> turn yourself away and shrug <eos> and you say that i can talk any time <eos> its easy living in a bubble <eos> and no complication or trouble <eos> but its hard to have responsibility <eos> and judging by you a personality <eos> and all the time you remind me <eos> of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug <eos> salt upon a bubbling slug <eos> you say i can talk to you any time <eos> but i just want to cut some rug <eos> turn yourself away and shrug <eos> and you say that i can talk any time <eos> and all the time you remind me <eos> of blitzkrieg and the doodle bug <eos> salt upon a bubbling slug <eos> you say i can talk to you any time <eos> but i just want to cut some rug <eos> turn yourself away and shrug <eos> and you say that i can talk any time <eos> i can talk to you any time <eos> but i just want to cut some rug <eos> its like blitzkrieg and the doodle bug <eos> salt upon a bubbling slug <eos> you say i can talk to you any time <eos> but i just want to cut some rug <eos> turn yourself away and shrug <eos> and you say that i can talk any time where did you go <eos> when things went wrong for you <eos> when the knives came out for you <eos> where did you go <eos> all you needed was a friend <eos> you just have to ask and then <eos> you dont have to have the solution <eos> youve got to understand the problem <eos> and dont go hoping for a miracle <eos> all this will fade away <eos> so im coming home <eos> what did you learn <eos> locked away all on your own <eos> chance and your head all blown <eos> what did you learn <eos> it was unfortunate <eos> you

no stars in sight <eos> there is no way to guide us <eos> through this night <eos> a thousand miles from the coast <eos> dead reckoning weve lost all hope <eos> as the waves crash over on the bow <eos> i listen as the wind begins to howl <eos> i hear the sirens singing out <eos> a luring sound with no one in sight <eos> they are <eos> too close to my ear tonight <eos> this is my last mayday call <eos> this shining ocean tells it all <eos> a reflection of what i will be <eos> in the water <eos> half the deck has gone under <eos> every possession i have is thrown <eos> as i begin to pray <eos> but not for this day <eos> the ship is lost its going down <eos> the crew has gone no ones around <eos> what else can i do <eos> i grab the wheel and think of you dont call me country when you call <eos> thats not the way i wish to fall <eos> there was a time when a stare meant so much <eos> now im relying on this love sick crush <eos> but dont call me country when you call <eos> thats not the way i wish to fall <eos> hand in hand well reach the ground <eos> hearts in rhythm leaving this town <eos> lost and away youll bring me back <eos> lost and away youll bring me back <eos> bring me back <eos> well when you wake up from that sleep <eos> please hesitate to call on me <eos> to bring up old apologies <eos> unending blame not revelry <eos> its all just romance of <eos> prolonging an end to this <eos> its all misspent energy <eos> its dead flowers grown in weeds <eos> but dont call me country when you call <eos> thats not the way i wish to fall <eos> suspects for self destruction are waiting for me <eos> the mind measures memories on misery <eos> lost and away youll bring me back <eos> lost and away youll bring me back <eos> bring me back <eos> and when you come to comfort these <eos> old ashes new epiphanies <eos> remember all the poverty we had <eos> what good lies in the aftermath <eos> all the alcohol and needless death <eos> all the pretty pests with sweetness left <eos> inside this rotting mess <eos> but dont call me country when you call <eos> thats not the way i wish to fall <eos> but lost and away youll bring me back <eos> lost and away youll bring me back <eos> bring me back your music is made between the notes <eos> your words are found between the quotes <eos> of all the things that you never said <eos> and all the things you wish you did <eos> its all that you can remember <eos> from the books that looked so lonely they surrendered <eos> to the fire and the water an the frozen <eos> sea where we found no one <eos> your pen lined the list of the greatest <eos> things in this world so you framed it <eos> like the tuning of an orchestra <eos> and the feeling you got when you loved her <eos> its a message from a photograph <eos> a slight smirk and a quite laugh <eos> its all that you can remember <eos> the details of life late december there you sit by yourself <eos> patiently waiting olive green shelf <eos> quaint and cute pale and blue

winter came and made it so oh look alike look alike <eos> underneath the grass would grow aiming at the sky <eos> it was swift it was just another wave of a miracle <eos> but no one nothing at all will go for the kill <eos> if they called on every soul in the land on the moon <eos> only them what they know a blessing in this curse <eos> the curse will come from the underground down by the shore

<eos> as we fill it to the brim <eos> we say the words we take them in <eos> oh how the hills were laughing <eos> how the creeks they cried <eos> how the grass would cheer on <eos> as we passed them by <eos> room for many room for few <eos> here in the dark i made for you <eos> oh why do i hear you and believe <eos> that we come together to make it sweet they wont know who we are <eos> so we both can pretend <eos> its written on the mountains <eos> a line that never ends <eos> as the devil spoke we spilled out on the floor <eos> and the pieces broke and the people wanted more <eos> and the rugged wheel is turning another round <eos> dorian carry on <eos> will you come along to the end <eos> will you ever let us carry on <eos> swaying like the children <eos> singled out for praise <eos>

dead <eos> its alive it is happening <eos> in the back of my head <eos> no future no past <eos> no laws of time <eos> can undo what is happening <eos> when i close my eyes <eos> and with the stars and the moon <eos> i woke up in the night <eos> in the same place <eos> to save me for my eyes <eos> its happening its happening its happening again <eos> its happening its happening its happening again <eos> i took a day or two <eos> to exile from the light <eos> to unfold that prisoner <eos> they call a mind <eos> and for a brief moment <eos> we could stop the time <eos> but with the stars and the moon <eos> i woke up in the night can you walk on the water with i you and i <eos> "because your bloods running cold" said the familiar true to life <eos> can you walk on the water with i you and i <eos> or keep your eyes on the road and live there familiar without you and i <eos> it glows with gates of gold true to life <eos> and our love is a ghost that the others cant see <eos> its a danger <eos> every shade of us you fade down to keep <eos> them in the dark on who we are <eos> oh what you do to me <eos> gonna be the death of me <eos> its a danger <eos> cause our love is a ghost that the others cant see <eos> we took a walk to the summit at night you and i <eos> to burn a hole in the old grip of the familiar you and i <eos> and the dark was opening wide do or die <eos> under a mask of a million ruling eyes <eos> and our love is a ghost that the others cant see <eos> its a danger <eos> every shade of us you fade down to keep <eos> them in the dark on who we are <eos> oh what you do to me <eos> gonna be the death of me <eos> its danger <eos> cause our love is a ghost that the others cant see the darkness and the ghost <eos> they dance so sweet and slow <eos> dugout from below there <eos> to damn the gods <eos> a grip that will hold <eos> so tight and close <eos> around my throat with <eos> the weight of all our lives <eos> you could give to my heart <eos> thousand words or more <eos> you could give to my heart <eos> thousand words or more <eos> the drum you stroke <eos> damn that beat so old <eos> in the ground it grows there <eos> to damn the sun oh what will come to life <eos> gates of gold <eos> in your head you hold <eos> a kingdom molten <eos> may the gods be on your side <eos> you could give to my heart <eos> thousand words or more <eos> you could give to my heart <eos> thousand words or more heaven hid her face as we fell down <eos> age old habits echoed in the ground <eos> one old sing and one would hold me down <eos> they might listen if i make no sound <eos> oh i know this <eos> from my high school heart <eos> that nothing is over <eos> from a touch it will begin <eos> wide on the sky <eos> in my house the silence rang so loud <eos> under doorways through the hallway down <eos> waiting for the secret to grow out <eos> oh what we do when no one is around <eos> oh i know this <eos> from my high school heart <eos> that nothing is over <eos> from a touch it will begin <eos> wide on the sky <eos> in the dark i hear you sing <eos> fingers move and chords they ring <eos> be the witness of my shame <eos> swaying in the summer rain <eos> feathers falling from your wing <eos> in the dark i hear you sing they say every sin will have a thousand eyes <eos> to guilty fools with guilty minds <eos> but i most be cruel to be kind <eos> deep within a my head of stone <eos> could i be of stone could i be of stone could i be <eos> oh how the birds forget to sing <eos> do they know where i have been <eos> oh how i will leave you there again <eos> deep within my head of stone <eos> could i be of stone could i be of stone could i be <eos> you are my only one <eos> you are my only one <eos> you are my lonely one <eos> you are my only one <eos> oh for the trees did grow there and the plants did spring <eos> oh for they know a lovers sin <eos> aint made of paper or of string <eos> its cast into a head of stone <eos> could i be of stone could i be of stone could i be rend a black drop from my heart <eos> with the weight of days <eos> the end of time has just begun <eos> i hear it call your name <eos> and no straining of the string <eos> can reverse what will begin <eos> some let go and some hold on <eos> there is no mistake <eos> if i could wash all ill away <eos> tell me would you stay <eos> and no lovers sin <eos> can reverse what will begin these bare bones are made of glass <eos> seethrough to the marrow as they pass <eos> seek through the keyhole a fate is cast <eos> deep in the mirror smiling back <eos> in shapes like these they run softly <eos> trojan horses trojan horses <eos> gardens grow in my eyes <eos> oh why do they <eos> gardens grow in my eyes <eos> oh why do they <eos> seek what i seek in a blinding flash <eos> these bare bones are made of glass <eos> in shapes like these they run softly <eos> trojan horses with all the children <eos> i tell myself i wanna hide <eos> i tell myself i wanna be lied to <eos> silent reader of my mind do you know what i will ask of you <eos> tell me if you wanna hide <eos> tell me if you wanna be lied to over the hill <eos> i will be waiting on for you <eos> i wont pretend <eos> that you dont mean nothing to me <eos> come now come now <eos> come back now come back now <eos> the doubt will creep <eos> and crawl in on you <eos> the dark can leap <eos> and fall upon you <eos> come back now come back now <eos> let it be let it go <eos> let it fall let it blow <eos> let it come let it go <eos> let it fall we will know guess who died last night <eos> in grey stockings in all might <eos> it was no loss <eos> the only god of mine <eos> he fell down just to drown <eos> in a sea of delight <eos> to tame champagne <eos> and creatures of the night <eos> as the water took him over <eos> filled his lungs inside out <eos> i sold his gold <eos> for flowers and rice <eos> speaking fire he would hire <eos> pawns and peasants just like me <eos> to feed upon the conquered ones <eos> but now we are free what is wrong at the end of the day <eos> what is really wrong no one dares to say <eos> you know youre wrong when theres only one right <eos> but what is wrong when right is out of sight <eos> right rode away long ago <eos> before rescuing wrong from below <eos> i might be mistaken i know <eos> but hey we need to be somewhat <eos> foolish feebleminded <eos> wrong and senseless <eos> right rode off long ago <eos> theres nothing more you need to know <eos> theres nothing more you need to show <eos> let us disagree <eos> cause wrong was made for you to be <eos> what is false when we cant hear no more <eos> and there is nothing to cover for <eos> what is wrong in this old wasted game <eos> may right and wrong be one and the same <eos> right rode away long ago <eos> before rescuing wrong from below <eos> i might be mistaken i know <eos> but hey we need to be somewhat <eos> foolish feebleminded <eos> wrong and senseless <eos> right rode off long ago <eos> theres nothing more you need to know <eos> theres nothing more you need to show <eos> let us disagree <eos> cause wrong was made for you to be voices in the street <eos> footsteps on the concrete <eos> guess i hear just every sound <eos> on the ground <eos> from my window view <eos> i know a color blue <eos> that can bite so very hard <eos> the day apart <eos> picture fresh as water clear <eos> days have passed without you here <eos> street lights dancing on the dark <eos> across the park <eos> waiting for a word from you <eos> waiting for a sign or two <eos> footsteps on the city ground <eos> you know the sound <eos> brother sparrow <eos> come tomorrow <eos> to my window <eos> brother sparrow <eos> come tomorrow <eos> to my window down by the river by the boats <eos> where everybody goes to be alone <eos> where you wont see any rising sun <eos> down to the river we will run <eos> when by the water we drink to the dregs <eos> look at the stones on the river bed <eos> i can tell from your eyes <eos> youve never been by the riverside <eos> down by the water the riverbed <eos> somebody calls you somebody says <eos> swim with the current and float away <eos> down by the river everyday <eos> oh my god i see how everything is torn in the river deep <eos> and i dont know why i go the way <eos> down by the riverside <eos> when that old river runs pass your eyes <eos> to wash off the dirt on the riverside <eos> go to the water so very near <eos> the river will be your eyes and ears <eos> i walk to the borders on my own <eos> to fall in the water just like a stone <eos> chilled to the marrow in them bones <eos> why do i go here all alone <eos> oh my god i see how everything is torn in the river deep <eos> and i dont know why i go the way <eos> down by the riverside black turns beamy bright <eos> turning on the light <eos> today is gonna be the day <eos> you hear somebody say <eos> we need you wide awake <eos> tiptoe over the floor <eos> what are you waiting for <eos> so so and no more <eos> thats all to be sorry for <eos> today is gonna be the day <eos> you hear somebody say <eos> we need you wide awake <eos> you hear the minutes kick and play <eos> the order of the day <eos> is hollering your way <eos> the window shade <eos> the nursing aid <eos> to let it all just work the way <eos> from head to toe <eos> a shadow grows <eos> since forever and a day <eos> quiet moments hum <eos> but some do you wrong <eos> today is gonna be the day <eos> you hear somebody say <eos> we need you wide awake <eos> no time for tea or lemonade <eos> someone has set the date <eos> were only half the way <eos> drink a toast to the sun <eos> to the things that never come <eos> to the break of the day <eos> that is all i say sunday morning im confined <eos> but the last time i could understand <eos> whats left in me i dont know <eos> but i wanted to be there tonight <eos> holding on i fall <eos> i discovered you in the mess of things <eos> when silence was my only friend <eos> watch the sky turn red as i look into your eyes youre gone <eos> days go by too quickly to fast i cant count <eos> and ill reach for you my love but im confined to my suffering <eos> seems so far away but i want to be there tonight <eos> holding on i fall <eos> days go by too quickly too fast i cant count <eos> and ill reach for you my love but im confined to my suffering in the lion house bewildered <eos> so scared to sigh in your own true voice <eos> how far is the way home <eos> unanswered questions lay so deep <eos> my own illusions are contained <eos> my own illusions hold me <eos> but i feel them i feel <eos> too much silence came between us <eos> and ill dream again to meet you there <eos> drifting in and out i feel the weight on my shoulders <eos> but im trying my hardest to keep control <eos> myself i wont believe it <eos> myself i want to <eos> i feel at home <eos> forgive me by myself <eos> i wanna be here <eos> for you to hold <eos> left alone i feel the pain <eos> take me away <eos> someday <eos> and i dream of the day <eos> i found you once <eos> i found you once again <eos> all the feelings you wanted to share <eos> but they were too much for you <eos> i found you once <eos> i found you once <eos> by myself <eos> will fall to the floor <eos> and feel no pain <eos> underline whats mine <eos> you take no more <eos> well come again <eos> someday <eos> somedays lost <eos> somedays lost <eos> somedays lost <eos> the weakness <eos> is killing <eos> the weakness <eos> the weakness killed me <eos> running for my own sake <eos> cant seem to get this straight <eos> im alone <eos> im alone <eos> im alone <eos> repeat and i will find the true intent and i will find myself <eos> so take good care of me for less and for all <eos> i will fall for all your words <eos> i will find the way <eos> to find myself again but when will you follow me <eos> hearts ache under the stress of you <eos> but i dont even know the true intent <eos> who ever were all in a fine mess <eos> how ever you finally break <eos> to find myself again but when will you follow <eos> decisions an eye full <eos> and i confess instrumental the same position the last of the daydreams carry on <eos> im caught up for sometime i see let it begin again <eos> why cant it be left this way ive been sitting here all my life <eos> im not choosing to go anywhere but its calling me <eos> my words are written in stone but i dont know them <eos> what is truth im not so sure anymore <eos> tears are falling and i cant see whats facing <eos> why cant it be forgiven my redemption <eos> tears are falling and i dont know why <eos> i long for later stop me before i ask for more i watch the surface bleed as your eyes come up wide <eos> and the pain is taken away <eos> im caught up in silence as hold my thoughts only to destroy myself <eos> something came between us <eos> a simple way to catch myself but its all in your words <eos> something came between us and ill be there for you <eos> as i walk symptoms take their toll and ill never heal again so far away <eos> i can still touch you <eos> so much to understand here <eos> but you take another step <eos> and ill be there <eos> you might fall <eos> you might fall turn a light <eos> you might fall <eos> you might fall turn a light on <eos> in my eyes i know i cant see you <eos> but in my mind i know i can believe <eos> too many times i feel past of the moment <eos> so underrated <eos> smiles on their faces <eos> hard to surprise <eos> many fears get in the way <eos> and ill be there <eos> you might fall <eos> you might fall turn a light <eos> you might fall <eos> you might fall turn a light on <eos> in my eyes i know i cant see you <eos> but in my mind i know i can believe <eos> believe i say <eos> too many times <eos> too many times <eos> i will long for the ride <eos> and i have to ask myself <eos> why <eos> too many times <eos> oh i know <eos> ill be there <eos> well i have you <eos> on my mind <eos> and ill hold you now inside <eos> inside <eos> well i have you <eos> on my mind inside <eos> well i hold you know inside <eos> inside me sunny days are gone <eos> holding tight to what ive left for so long <eos> i cant hide away from the pain <eos> i carry on <eos> will you take my hand <eos> or will you turn away <eos> will you take my hand <eos> or will you turn away <eos> i tuck myself in <eos> wishing to dream of you <eos> with no energy to live <eos> under my covers <eos> is where i stay <eos> and i reach for you <eos> but i cant crawl <eos> beneath mysilence silence <eos> and i can depend on myself <eos> to let me down <eos> we design your words yoursilence silence <eos> as i grab ahold <eos> i feel it slipping away again <eos> will you take my hand <eos> or will you turn away <eos> will you take my hand <eos> or will you turn its all away for now i can only use only find <eos> and the clock is ticking away <eos> i try to find some comfort in myself but i need a little time <eos> and ill be same <eos> im holding on to my memories now <eos> what ever happened to those days <eos> when we use to be there for eachother <eos> where are we now <eos> and ill be the same if i could find <eos> something too little to call my own <eos> no pain i cant decide <eos> too many problems i cant decide <eos> no pain take a chance for me <eos> i know i cant disguise the way i feel <eos> lift the pages i once knew outside lay the ashes alone <eos> and i was taken by the hand tonight <eos> and i wont fade into the distance <eos> watch the sickness hold the mirror <eos> the simplest of times i know <eos> and i force myself through another day <eos> as we force ourselves through another year <eos> fade away <eos> i know i cant disguise the way i feel <eos> and i wont fade into the distance <eos> im setting circles old mythologies guessing at a few words <eos> its probably now that i need you the most <eos> when im one half child and the other ghost <eos> and one of em wants to pull you close and the other to let you go <eos> times criminal love heart won <eos> and love defies everyone <eos> inside my skin a skeleton is warming up his act <eos> though my bodys my dog and my friend doesnt bite <eos> though he looks severe and erudite <eos> a hundred degrees fahrenheit hes as cool as an ermine <eos> if one of these is a poison cup and my acceptance seems abrupt <eos> but if youre gonna line em up well i have to knock em down <eos> well theres nothing so wrong that whats right cant fix <eos> despite how blood and water mix and when a pony runs out of tricks and his work has just begun <eos> now lord duty bade me fight <eos> just a lonely impulse of delight and balancing had brought to mind <eos> the years to come the years behind <eos> will i grow weary of the sun remembering what i have done with old mythologies <eos> you gotta choose <eos> you wanted the song to rescue us <eos> amy what did you leave for us <eos> so we could get home <eos> solomon sang shebas grace and he kissed her soft and sulking face <eos> if one of us has to leave this place will the other come along <eos> we been on the round and round <eos> shared our kisses by the pound and chased our shadows on the ground <eos> spilled our cups in china town <eos> put up the moon took down the sun <eos> played our songs for everyone <eos> remembering what we had done with old mythologies <eos> you gotta choose <eos> you wanted the song to rescue us <eos> amy what did you leave for us <eos> so we could get home i tuned the devils harp <eos> it was the last thing that i heard <eos> before i walked the stretch of road between nagoya and absurd <eos> i meant to find my lover there <eos> but i found a little bird <eos> she sang me how the world was made <eos> i hung on every word <eos> she told me why the rabbit cries and why some stars were red <eos> she told me where the doper goes to lay his weary head <eos> and that the world was incomplete <eos> and the king would soon be dead <eos> she offered me her wing that night <eos> i took the road instead <eos> maybe im back baby <eos> maybe im falling from the poplar tree <eos> carry me back baby <eos> with borrowed pride <eos> i could not hide <eos> i grew a sailors beard <eos> and as i walked to my innocence <eos> my leaves disappeared <eos> rented a room upon the hill <eos> where a marble cat appeared <eos> showed me where the fire was <eos> and i had nothing to fear <eos> for all gods good <eos> and brotherhood <eos> we drank til i was crowned <eos> then a lady from the everglades pulled my ass up off the ground <eos> she kissed me four times on the cheek <eos> and once upon the brow <eos> for a moment i believed that i had come for what i found <eos> now i sit alone with all the cracks in my guitar <eos> for all the miles ive put behind <eos> i havent come that far <eos> but we are all compelled to look <eos> for the wind inside a jar <eos> maybe im back baby <eos> maybe im falling from the poplar tree <eos> carry me back baby im a deacons son <eos> lazy as the day is long <eos> could be anyone <eos> but im a deacons son <eos> have a one eyed dog

once you strip the paint you find it <eos> everywhere you go <eos> and you and i should know <eos> love is enough <eos> love is enough <eos> love is enough at the end of the tracks <eos> when the white flag waves <eos> and the heart attacks <eos> love is enough when you dont look back <eos> my country is a cross <eos> and my city is a vice <eos> in so perilous a place <eos> at such a bloodbegotten price <eos> so just forget i ever said <eos> thats its true love aint enough <eos> theres a killer in my bed <eos> and enough is not enough <eos> once you strip the paint you find it <eos> everywhere you go <eos> and you and i should know <eos> everything that we esteem forever or a day <eos> dont drive my love away <eos> love is enough <eos> love is enough <eos> love is enough at the end of the tracks <eos> when the car wrecks heart attacks <eos> love is enough when you dont look back the bears at the window <eos> the moon is on time <eos> the record keeps playing <eos> that nursery rhyme <eos> the shape of my toenail <eos> reminds me of spain <eos> a half glass of whiskey <eos> is all that remains <eos> your phones on the table <eos> my heads on its way <eos> down the drain <eos> i need a little hallelujah <eos> to feel no pain <eos> to feel no pain <eos> a light in the attic <eos> a bird in a cage <eos> dear mrs henry <eos> feeds mr beige <eos> the lock on the

up ahead <eos> im looking for synonyms <eos> rhyming with dread <eos> my bulldog reflection <eos> stares back from the mirror instead <eos> i need a little hallelujah <eos> to feel no pain <eos> to feel no pain i was holding my breath <eos> when the tightrope walker <eos> slipped into the moonglow <eos> saying all my children follow me <eos> maybe its time to go <eos> you can be chrome when youre wise <eos> can be wise when youre blue <eos> and baby if i have then i have for you <eos> bribing the jury to keep me in jail <eos> singing "tea for the tillerman" <eos> and although i lie fantastically <eos> i swore an oath on my history <eos> its a miracle i can see <eos> you can be wrong when youre right <eos> even when youre right on cue <eos> and if i die tonight then i die for you <eos> calling on those that call me son <eos> greatgrandson or grandson <eos> great uncles aunts and relatives <eos> to judge what i have done <eos> gonna make right by you <eos> even if its all i do <eos> and if its all i do then i do for you <eos> people will raise a whole lot of hell about <eos> the water and the windmill <eos> and although i stab chaotically <eos> it hurts no one but me <eos> even the darkness has arms <eos> but they aint got you <eos> baby i have it and i have you too <eos> and a light in the window <eos> to pass the night through <eos> may be so uncertain but what can i do <eos> keeping it on keeping it on <eos> and i know i like it but what does that prove <eos> sometimes i worry i dont know <eos> how to love you <eos> i bring to you with reverend hands <eos> all the books that my love abides <eos> kind woman that my passion wore <eos> like the shoreline wears the tides <eos> maybe the water went dry <eos> keeping an eye on you <eos> and with an eye on you it could drown me too <eos> people will raise a whole lot of hell about <eos> the water and the windmill <eos> and although i stab quixotically <eos> i swore an oath on my history <eos> its a miracle i can see <eos> even the darkness has arms <eos> but they aint got you <eos> baby i have it and i have you too <eos> and a light in the window <eos> to pass the night through <eos> may be so uncertain but what can i do <eos> keeping it on keeping it on <eos> and i know i like it but what does that prove <eos> sometimes i worry i dont know <eos> how to love you hunt like a wolf run like a river <eos> put your hand on the chest <eos> of a heart that is beating <eos> you lie in debt to a lover beholden <eos> trained on the thought of a singular union <eos> drive a hole through the mountain <eos> drive the car from the east <eos> to the western ocean <eos> back to a time when a promise <eos> was more easily broken <eos> these were the seeds of the terrible winter <eos> your mother was old <eos> when she said to you <eos> its not just how you see it <eos> but its how youre gonna see it through <eos> i know you want to give it up <eos> but who you gonna give it to <eos> guilty like the sun <eos> out of the womb into the ether <eos> feel the rain on your head <eos> and the tundra beneath ya <eos> a sudden blow and nobody <eos> with a body can reach ya <eos> a dog needs a bone and that ought to teach ya <eos> your mother was old <eos> when she said to you <eos> its not just how you see it <eos> but its how youre gonna see it through <eos> i know you want to give it up <eos> but who you gonna give it to <eos> when you love thats incomplete <eos> its twice as bitter and half as sweet <eos> guilty like the sun <eos> guilty like the sun <eos> the rattle in your bones <eos> the salt in your tears <eos> that bating of your breath <eos> the ring in your ears <eos> and its clear <eos> youre getting closer <eos> to your fears <eos> hunt like a wolf run like a river <eos> put your hand on the chest <eos> of a heart that is beating <eos> you lie in debt to a lover beholden <eos> these were the seeds of the terrible winter bow and arrow no wind <eos> high up in the dawn light <eos> where everything begins <eos> no direction but a steady drum <eos> over the treetops put my knuckle <eos> on the sun <eos> oh mama i cannot say <eos> that im not affected <eos> by your orange blossom ways <eos> took aim spoke low <eos> backed up to the west <eos> and let that little arrow go <eos> valhallas want to name you <eos> old relations in the valley <eos> want to claim you

fashioned ways <eos> theres some blood some bone <eos> something so sweet about <eos> the air back home <eos> some name it some blame it <eos> some would rather see it go <eos> while others want to claim it <eos> every jewel that you find <eos> every glass you drain <eos> and every watch you wind <eos> i can moan like a dog <eos> and kick like a mule <eos> say ive been sleeping well <eos> that

the wombs we lived in <eos> spread out along the road <eos> and ive been weak <eos> when my lord was calling <eos> the water will take our load <eos> on the day that you were born <eos> legions laid down their arms <eos> on the day you lost control <eos> legions leapt for your throat <eos> telling me im wrong <eos> is the face in the water unmistakable <eos> blacks the color of the sea <eos> when its free from the light of the sun <eos> your crystal ball <eos> your faith in the age of medicine <eos> and the children are asleep <eos> with their heads on the butt of a gun <eos> you put up a wall <eos> keep the bad ones out <eos> and the good ones in <eos> fight the battle on your knees <eos> till the sea swallows everyone <eos> come in the water <eos> or is there somewhere you have to go <eos> well keep a lantern open <eos> in case you lose your way in the cold <eos> on the day that you were born <eos> legions laid down their arms <eos> on the day they found you out <eos> left no shadow of a doubt <eos> and the children are asleep <eos> with their heads on the butt of a gun <eos> fight the battle on your knees <eos> till the sea swallows everyone i thought if i fought you <eos> in the open field <eos> your bayonet would crack <eos> on my hot iron shield <eos> but you caught be running <eos> now im at your command <eos> a servant to forces <eos> that i dont understand <eos> if you were the shepherd <eos> and i was the lamb <eos> and long was the journey <eos> and dark was the land <eos> who would be following <eos> who would be free <eos> who would believe <eos> that the shepherd was me <eos> when that poet decides <eos> how the heroine dies <eos> he commits original sin <eos> when that last ray decays <eos> from the boardwalk parades <eos> yours is the

the sun brotherly surrounded <eos> foreigner to grief <eos> for a little while <eos> youve been getting easy feed <eos> skin and teeth are weak <eos> youll be surprised <eos> you go down so easily <eos> you go wrong when youre in need <eos> you go down so easily <eos> you go round and you go round <eos> when the motherline leaves me cold <eos> what will i begin <eos> no one has warned me <eos> i will strive peacefully <eos> grow stronger by disease <eos> the story of the meek <eos> ill go down so easily <eos> ill go wrong and ill succeed <eos> ill go down so peacefully <eos> ill go round hes the one who needs the night <eos> for worry and interpretation <eos> hes a genius of the wrong kind <eos> he feeds as he needs the mind <eos> and holding on doesnt stir him <eos> you dont know him but you know hes right <eos> brother of mine <eos> to live in the land you own <eos> sow and watch grow <eos> the body is all we are <eos> im in control <eos> nothing will seperate <eos> i was once what i see in you <eos> leo was a friend and saviour <eos> he added colour to the eyes <eos> youre concealing what you know about <eos> in poems and tenacious wordings <eos> youre a genius of the wrong kind <eos> brother of mine <eos> grow into the man you are <eos> how would you know <eos> the body is all we are <eos> i feel whole <eos> nothing will seperate cigarretes and taste of your jd <eos> that room cant hide the lips of my lady <eos> shes sometimes kind of brave and through her glass and ice <eos> im loosing all my senses <eos> why dont you dance in front of me <eos> i was so upset babe but you got me <eos> who knows if youre waiting for anything <eos> until the night is over <eos> theyre playing that song again and your eyes are following <eos> the best way to get into my mind <eos> the people is looking arround to see how you move <eos> you feel mischievous <eos> why dont you dance in front of me <eos> i was so upset babe but you got me <eos> who knows if youre waiting for anything <eos> until the night is over the end of the line <eos> calamity at first sight <eos> now the man in me dont walk right <eos> just like a pebble in my shoe <eos> but you were a wanderer <eos> and a competent one at that <eos> so it caught me by surprise this venerability <eos> that i never thought i had <eos> oh and you tried so hard to say <eos> everything you wanted to <eos> and with an aching tongue <eos> you spat out at the world now not of words <eos> but of a pearl that had belonged to her <eos> so i went back to the country <eos> where the air was mild and sweet <eos> i was in need of some reprieve and intermission <eos> to gather up my things and to get back upon my feet <eos> but i cant say ive got the answers <eos> for its always shades of grey <eos> but theres a warmth in the air in mid september <eos> and its enough across my face just to <eos> remind me that im well upon my way <eos> and i feel the ease <eos> man i feel it tingle in my toes <eos> how funny are the way that these memories do grow <eos> into some old french film in black and white <eos> and i know the ropes <eos> because you see ive said goodbye to some lovers <eos> fleshed out and tied to each other <eos> by that invisible string it tangles me <eos> and when that morning came up fast well it <eos> broke the fever square upon its back <eos> and finally i felt just like i should <eos> oh the blood under my fingers warm <eos> the clearing of a two month storm now done <eos> so i went back to the country <eos> where the air now bitter sweet <eos> and subtle is the change of my indifference <eos> but strange how the solitude <eos> can leave a man complete <eos> and i cant wait till the morning <eos> be it sunshine hail or snow <eos> see i do not believe in superstition <eos> but somewhere upon this mess <eos> i may have found some happiness to call my own <eos> oh and time is a healer <eos> time is a friend of mine <eos> in time if you feel it <eos> would you be a friend of mine <eos> oh i hope youre a friend of mine and ive been worried for a while now <eos> cos you dont look the same <eos> how the devil takes his toll <eos> when you go walking through that flame <eos> and im not saying its been easy <eos> but you know all too well <eos> that you cannot replace the space <eos> your spirit had once held <eos> so we run through the jungle <eos> and i can feel the rhythm of war <eos> you see im fighting <eos> but i just cant fight anymore <eos> im in awe <eos> so well give ourselves to the harlequin dream <eos> giving over all our friends and our family <eos> and well say goodbye to the world that we love <eos> for i can no longer deny my blood <eos> and now youre taking on a kingdom <eos> im ravenous for more <eos> an appetite so beautiful <eos> but vacant to its core <eos> ive been living on my instincts <eos> so you better run <eos> you better keep moving along <eos> for it seems i have been wondering <eos> far too long <eos> so we run through the jungle <eos> and i can feel the rhythm of war <eos> you see im fighting <eos> but i just cant fight anymore <eos> im in awe <eos> so well give ourselves to the harlequin dream <eos> giving over all our friends and our family <eos> and well say goodbye to the world that we love <eos> for i can no longer deny my blood cause you hurting i can tell it by the way that you move <eos> you get your head on your chest and your chest in your mouth <eos> you dont look so good therell be change <eos> cause this one is to be to see <eos> but brother your scared and im scared <eos> when your scared cause you aint suppose to be <eos> so im screaming loud loud loud <eos> would you get out my way <eos> cause i got the animal i got the beast on lease this day <eos> so you dont go wondering back down to back to old fool <eos> ways and help <eos> when way you <eos> just to watch you this way <eos> just to watch you this way i wasnt born this way <eos> ive been living a lie they say <eos> so when it brought me to my knees <eos> well i had everything so tell me would you please <eos> how could i possibly have needed so much more <eos> the thing i was craving then <eos> was some kind of laboring <eos> so i might find a friend <eos> in all the aching in my muscles as they hurt <eos> oh wont you put my hands to work <eos> to ease my mind <eos> and you realize in a moments grace <eos> youve been unraveling the fabric of your coat <eos> and you pick a line down the wall and trace <eos> until the end <eos> and when you walk back sorry <eos> with a folding body <eos> like you should <eos> no i am not <eos> gonna die this way <eos> maybe it was the mold you see <eos> that was knocking the wall in me <eos> and i forgot just what it was <eos> that i had needed for all the time id been given <eos> maybe id forgot what living was now for <eos> and you realize in a moments grace <eos> you might just already be on to something good <eos> and you pick a line down a cord and trace <eos> because you can <eos> and when it comes back heavy <eos> youll be more than ready <eos> like you should <eos> cause i am not <eos> gonna die this way <eos> through a crack in the road it sprung <eos> the seedling warm and young <eos> stretching out for the sun <eos> its august and im grinnin <eos> for this time i might be winnin <eos> as the moving lights that time of year lay still <eos> and as my body changes a pace i seem to know again <eos> that i am not gonna die this way <eos> and ill hold my misses <eos> in a bed of kisses <eos> like i should <eos> cause i am not <eos> gonna die this way i have lived a life of sin in this world im living in <eos> i have done forbidden things i shouldnt do <eos> i ask a beggar along the way if he could tell me where to stay <eos> where i could find real happiness and love thats true <eos> across the bridge theres no more sorrow <eos> across the bridge theres no more pain <eos> the sun will shine across the river <eos> and youll never be unhappy again <eos> follow the footsteps of the king till you hear the voices ring <eos> theyll be singing out the glory of the land <eos> the river jordan will be newand the sound of trumpet you will hear <eos> and youll behold the most precious place never known to man <eos> across the bridge theres no more sorrow <eos> across the bridge theres no more sorrow in all youll see <eos> what was it that came down on me that night <eos> a conjuring i held on to that moment <eos> and lie just to make it alive <eos> i stood out there in the covering <eos> in the baskings of a holy night <eos> and i was lucid and conscious <eos> and hovering like a firefly <eos> my mind stretched out on the canopy <eos> it put its arms out slow <eos> and i heard the whispers of silence floating down from the radio <eos> so come on come on im ready now <eos> i got the feeling honey like im ready to roll <eos> you see im not gonna wait till the end of me <eos> cause i got the burning fire in bed of my soul <eos> i saw the light from a kettle gun <eos> sixteen days under a southern sun <eos> and there were times when i thought that <eos> i wouldnt mind it if i lost my mind out there <eos> you wouldnt believe me if i told you so <eos> the things i saw were enough to make the man in me <eos> a man in me make a man of me <eos> so come on come on im ready now <eos> go get your things out honey lets get ready to roll <eos> oh i can feel the wave coming over me <eos> ive been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go <eos> as a child i was wondereyed at the thought that i might know <eos> a life in the ecstasy of rockn roll <eos> oohoh im not taking it slow <eos> im an arrow in a bow <eos> you think that i dont know what it is that makes me glow <eos> so come on come on im ready now <eos> i got the feeling honey like im ready to roll <eos> you see im not gonna wait till the end of me <eos> cause i got the burning fire in the bed of my soul standin on the

inside <eos> to see whats going on <eos> oh but i hate you sometimes for making me feel <eos> the way i feel feel feel <eos> for the love that keeps me sane <eos> is killing me all the same <eos> its killing me its killing me im done <eos> and its just one of those days <eos> i cant stop thinking about you <eos> im as heavy as my hangover is heat <eos> and i woke up in a sweat <eos> and ive been wanting to explain <eos> that im aware of consequence <eos> and im aware of pain now too <eos> oh but i hate you sometimes <eos> for making me feel the way i feel feel feel <eos> for the love that keeps me sane <eos> is killing me all the same <eos> and i dont see the point now <eos> of dragging ourselves <eos> through all that shame shame shame <eos> no i aint no fucking traitor <eos> im hurting all the same <eos> im sorry for whatever i have done <eos> now i walk i walk alone <eos> and your face follows where i go <eos> but i wont walk that way you know <eos> a hurt that only makes you grow <eos> it tears a hole right through you <eos> and ill forever know i wandered again to my home in the mountains <eos> where in youths early dawn i was happy and free <eos> i looked for my friends but i never could find them <eos> i found they were all rank strangers to me <eos> everybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger <eos> no mother or dad not a friend could i see <eos> they knew not my name and i knew not their faces <eos> i found they were all rank strangers to me <eos> now theyve all moved away said the voice of a stranger <eos> to a beautiful home by a bright crystal sea <eos> and some day ill meet them all up in heaven <eos> where no one will be a rank stranger to me take my eyes my melody <eos> for i choose not to say <eos> mix my blood with honey <eos> for the taste so sweet <eos> i felt it moving through my skin <eos> this feeling wrapped around my sin <eos> im shedding off my innocence <eos> it plays upon my sanity <eos> this feeling its taking over me <eos> one with my head my soul my memory <eos> my loving home my family <eos> as im shedding off my innocence <eos> for the lizard i choose to be <eos> to be young my friend is a curse none the less <eos> and a curse i choose to leave <eos> i felt it moving through my skin <eos> this feeling wrapped around my sin <eos> one with my head my soul my memory <eos> my loving home my family <eos> i know

she came back round <eos> drifting across my sight <eos> some apparition of make believe <eos> i felt my chest grow tight <eos> and i tumbled in <eos> and she said "hey baby hold my hand out on the wire" <eos> oh im telling you the whole thing is just a braking of desire <eos> you inevitably hold on <eos> because you always do <eos> you better walk that wire <eos> im talking tons cause im not made of steel <eos> somebody save me from myself <eos> im just a man alright and im fumbling <eos> with all this faded advice <eos> maybe the moment to make my move <eos> you hold your breath so tight <eos> cause were tumbling <eos> and she said "hey baby hold my hand out on the wire" <eos> ive been telling the whole time <eos> its just a breaking of desire <eos> now i promise youll be brave too <eos> cause youve earned that right <eos> you better walk that wire <eos> theres something in the air tonight <eos> be steady as you walk away <eos> and were never going to know right <eos> its better then the other way <eos> she said "hey baby hold my hand out on the wire" <eos> see i never would have held on <eos> but at the aching of desire <eos> no theres heaven in a folk song <eos> so just hold on <eos> cause youre dancing on the wire <eos> alright its time to love <eos> snow from above <eos> its time to care <eos> winter is here <eos> a snow white kiss <eos> everythings bliss <eos> and on your nose <eos> summer tears froze <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a crystal clear love <eos> a snow white kiss <eos> everything is bliss <eos> and on your nose <eos> summer tears froze <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a crystal clear love <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a snow white kiss <eos> everything is bliss <eos> and on your nose <eos> summer tears froze <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a wintertime love <eos> a crystal clear love <eos> a wintertime love <eos> love love love <eos> whos hiding the tears above <eos> a wintertime love echoes start as a cross in you <eos> trembling noises that come too soon <eos> spatial movement which seems to you <eos> resonating your mask or feud <eos> hollow talking and hollow girl <eos> force it up from the root of pain <eos> never said it was good never said it was near <eos> shadow rises and you are here <eos> and then you cut <eos> you cut it out <eos> and everything <eos> goes back to the beginning <eos> silence seizes a cluttered room <eos> light is shed not a breath too soon <eos> darkness rises in all you do <eos> standing and drawn across the room <eos> spatial movements are butterflies <eos> shadows scatter without a fire <eos> theres never been bad there has always been truth <eos> muted whisper of the things shell move <eos> and then you cut <eos> you cut it out <eos> and everything <eos> goes back to the beginning <eos> never said it was good never said it was new <eos> muted whisper of the things you feel so dramatic when you called <eos> so dramatic going down <eos> so dramatic when you sang <eos> its the best you ever get <eos> ever get <eos> next summer i will return <eos> ill be back <eos> ill break your heart <eos> ill break your heart <eos> when next summer starts <eos> next summer i will return <eos> ill be back <eos> youll crash and burn <eos> now its your turn <eos> to crash and burn <eos> and youll be just like a hurricane <eos> ruining everything im spending my time <eos> walking spirals in line <eos> did i ever honestly believe <eos> a change of mind <eos> and then a change of position <eos> only action no reaction no <eos> this time is mine together we cant spend it anyway <eos> nothing is gonna change nothing is ever gonna change <eos> and im a trigger <eos> youre my gun <eos> dont you wanna come <eos> dont you taste the times that come <eos> back and

mind and then a change of position <eos> did we ever honestly believe <eos> watching dead bodies and bombs falling from the sky <eos> nothings gonna change nothing is ever gonna change <eos> and im a trigger <eos> youre my gun <eos> dont you wanna come <eos> dont you taste the times that come <eos> back and forth in one once i could see <eos> now i am found out ive been set free <eos> nothing ever

me <eos> saint <eos> i dont know your name <eos> but your voice so strong <eos> speaks through the glass <eos> speaks through the ground <eos> an empty phrase <eos> a hollow sound <eos> calm <eos> quite severe <eos> leave the throng <eos> a mind so clear <eos> you feel no pain <eos> an end so near <eos> you taste the blood <eos> how long <eos> how long <eos> how long <eos> how long at least at least <eos> youre fast asleep <eos> and wont remember yet <eos> how for far too long <eos> your nows been numb <eos> we used to dive for it <eos> now the rest of yous got all the bad from me <eos> the rest of yous got time <eos> crushed through the skull and dug out back <eos> lying in tongues all be damned <eos> yawn at the bombs aftermath <eos> meaning no harm apart from that <eos> concede conceit <eos> so fast asleep <eos> the humans far away <eos> with their songs all wrong <eos> the sads all gone <eos> they used to dive for it holy mass my kingdoms come <eos> an angle on foot in my worlds <eos> her words rewrote them all <eos> lends each letter <eos> graciously <eos> my mind mouthing mute for her lips <eos> to slip into <eos> she sings like it forgave me <eos> sings like it forgave me <eos> seems like it forgave me <eos> a perfect picture takes my place <eos> the hungover body sings a song so sugarcoated <eos> the words deliver light from day <eos> what came from the sun made a sun so ordinary <eos> burn like it forgave me <eos> burn like it forgave me <eos> she sings like it forgave me <eos> seems like it forgave me <eos> been so anesthetized <eos> by someone elsee skies <eos> so hallowed <eos> a knowing numbness falls <eos> to flow beneath those calls <eos> to follow the moon kids won the war <eos> snared a lonely passerby <eos> to celebrate the electric chair <eos> on a disappearing island <eos> but theres no one crying over me either <eos> so lighten up the camera flood <eos> early on the latest feeling <eos> cos i dont mind your idle mind <eos> much slower than a picture <eos> cos theres no one crying over me either <eos> you stayed up late my roaming shut in <eos> dont belong your luck is fleeting <eos> to set aside a sunset for those <eos> skinny shaded fuckwits <eos> but theres no one crying over them either <eos> like theres no one crying over me <eos> i want it but i need it like the hole in my head <eos> if the hip kids buy in <eos> put another hole in my head <eos> cool enough to always be dead wild yonder <eos> come sweetly <eos> its over <eos> completely <eos> nail me down <eos> ive covered my tracks with mistakes <eos> unsticking the stars mirrored backs <eos> the sky leaks <eos> theyre looking with eyes glittered black <eos> no heart breaks <eos> hows it not enough <eos> wild yonder <eos> come slowly <eos> and kill so <eos> exactly <eos> no honest mans words can bear all this cutting <eos> bored cities the babes drugs round <eos> filters illfitting and labored <eos> drown <eos> ive covered my tracks with mistakes <eos> unasticking the stars mirrored backs <eos> the sky leaks <eos> theyre looking with eyes glittered black <eos> no heart breaks <eos> hows it not enough when it never ends <eos> well i know <eos> it ended long ago i wish <eos> so many people clung to the shore <eos> each ones now singing <eos> much better than before <eos> look at those people <eos> clung to the shore <eos> each ones now singing <eos> much better than before <eos> better than before feels much better now ive the life i was due <eos> no more disorder in your opposing view <eos> looks deceiving premonitions ive got mine <eos> a hundred hearings see me smiling every time <eos> now that <eos> i can do no wrong <eos> lately <eos> but i could do no wrong <eos> then <eos> and ill save you from reason <eos> the smell of sulfur <eos> yeah i can do no wrong <eos> feels much better now ive the life i was due <eos> sundays soldiers laid out now i cant lose <eos> and in your fading prearranged and made up mind <eos> everythings the cure nothing is the crime <eos> nobody hates my term cause im so young and nobody hates my term <eos> i cant wait my turn cause im not young and i cant wait my turn in the land of plenty <eos> enough means more the earth <eos> in a speechless business <eos> with the word above <eos> big blind blue lines <eos> brought my fist to the spine <eos> to weed out the meekness <eos> from a worn out mind <eos> i just wanted you to sit right <eos> shouldve broken every bone for the first time <eos> im not afraid of no rock n rollers <eos> son take my hand whos the better man <eos>

another one opens there is a swelling storm <eos> and im caught up in the middle of it all <eos> and it takes control <eos> of the person that i thought i was the boy i used to know <eos> there is a light in the dark and i feel its warmth <eos> in my hands in my heart why cant i hold on <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it always does it always does <eos> we watched as our young hearts fade into the flood into the flood <eos> freedom falling the feeling that i thought was set in stone <eos> slip through my fingers trying hard to let go <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it carries us away <eos> though the wind down to the place <eos> we used to lay when we were kids <eos> memories of a stolen place <eos> caught in silence like i lost in space <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it always does it always does <eos> we watched as our young hearts fade into the flood into the flood <eos> freedom falling the feeling that i thought was set in stone <eos> slip through my fingers trying hard to let go <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it carries us away <eos> i watched my world view disappear in front of my eyes <eos> moments of magic and wonder seems so hard to find <eos> is it ever coming back again <eos> is it ever coming back again <eos> take me back to the feeling when <eos> everything was left to find <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it always does we always does <eos> freedom falling the feeling that i thought was set in stone <eos> slip through my fingers trying hard to let go <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it comes and goes in waves <eos> it carries us away theres something hidden beneath <eos> not sure what could it be <eos> and words unspoken lie beside me <eos> eyes wide open <eos> staring a hole into the sky <eos> i see things that never really happened to me <eos> so i lie in the shadow flat on the ground <eos> leaves covering my face <eos> ive been here far too long <eos> i think its time for me to go <eos> and i would never dare to stand tall <eos> and fight for my own life <eos> i am just like any other fainthearted man you walked me home late that night <eos> and you laid a kiss on my hand <eos> say goodbye <eos> and though its been a long long time <eos> since the night we walked our separate ways <eos> youre on my mind <eos> and ive been here before <eos> ive walked this floor <eos> and i already know were collapsing <eos> and i kept you near and i kept you distant <eos> but the more i did the more i failed <eos> i was wrong <eos> but there are things i have to deal with <eos> in my own specific puzzled way <eos> and ill be fine <eos> and its a simple rule to keep in your mind <eos> that nothing ever changes but you <eos> time will never be on your side i am loosing my mind over you <eos> and im so sorry but soon ill have to go <eos> cause i wont shine the way you want me to shine <eos> im gray im pale and nothing more <eos> ill rip my heart out of my chest <eos> ill spit it out and try to forget <eos> and ill keep my hands away <eos> and pretend as if i had nothing left to say step into a puddle and try not to make the reflection to move <eos> step into the cold dirty water as if you stepped into the sky <eos> a half of me is lost <eos> and the other half still belongs to you <eos> its been several years since we last spoke <eos> should i just let it go should i leave it to you <eos> the easier the question <eos> the harder the answer seems to be a black gloomy wave of despair pushing me down <eos> the house gets flooded and theres no chance im ever getting out <eos> and my lungs get filled with water <eos> and im drowning in my sorrow <eos> and your hands reaching out towards me <eos> im hoping they would touch me <eos> but im still a fool desperately waiting for something that would never ever happen <eos> so let me stay here let me rot <eos> let me stay here let me get eaten up i simply cannot recognize this face looking straight back at me <eos> though it seems so familiar as if i had seen it a million times before <eos> and the vicious cycle never ends <eos> it spins around until it bends <eos> and then it starts all over again <eos> and the words you constantly repeat <eos> i cannot help but wonder what do they really mean <eos> the have lost all the power in me and i simply do not believe <eos> up and down my twisted spine reaching deep for my hidden scars <eos> and it hurts so bad a bright silver eye seeping through the dark dark night sky <eos> whatever may come i dont care <eos> im staying right here in spite <eos> what happened here before is of no importance <eos> your presence is just as violent a stab as your absence <eos> and the beauty of long lost light i so frantically wish upon <eos> whatever may come ill be right here by your side theres an empty field ahead of me <eos> and the further i look the less i see <eos> and the rain comes pouring down on me <eos> and the black dog is running beside me <eos> and its so hard to admit <eos> that the only thing i want to do <eos> is to follow him <eos> you promise me way too much high up above the highest cloud is where i long to be <eos> with the lightest breeze lifting me up and filling up each broken part in me <eos> and i sit there waiting patiently for the ships to sails out into the sea <eos> and i wait there endlessly though i know theres no ships nor sea below me <eos> three white horses and a queen of hearts <eos> its a story that never quite starts <eos> and i watch it from afar <eos> my own destiny that lies in the stars my poor brother told me we would suffer <eos> and no matter how hard we would try <eos> we would never really get to see whats right <eos> and many years later <eos> within the brightest light <eos> well both stand in the garden and everything else will be lost <eos> but god knows we tried <eos> we will walk as long as it will take for us to reach home <eos> and i know i said i would <eos> but i could not i was wandering through the streets of the city <eos> rambling through the avenues of time <eos> when from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl <eos> and by chance her eyes fell onto mine <eos> so i sat and acted all nonnonchalant <eos> she smoked her lavender cigarette <eos> reading the future that lay in my hands <eos> my shadow played a bass clarinet <eos> where you going with this bret <eos> we waltzed down a moonlight boulevard <eos> just two silhouettes in the mist <eos> ah yes <eos> days went by and years went by <eos> moments went by when we kissed <eos> when was this <eos> she said your beard is woven of heartache <eos> and well drink for the lonely tonight <eos> and the moon is a horny old drunkard <eos> uh bret could you please move over to your right <eos> we drank dandelion wine and we reminisced <eos> about the moment we first met that day <eos> im trying to watch tv <eos> then we reminisced about how we first reminisced <eos> oh yeah sounds a bit gay <eos> she handed me a broken memory <eos> a keepsake to forever most say <eos> a brief taste of love is as sweet as any <eos> and with that she made her way <eos> oh yeah what was her name <eos> she said her name was a secret <eos> then she said her name was cherie <eos> was her middle name cherie <eos> so its a secret cherie maybe <eos> mm maybe <eos> whatd she look like <eos> she looked like a parisian river <eos> what dirty <eos> she looked like a chocolate eclair <eos> thats rare <eos> her eyes were reflections of eyes <eos> oh nice <eos> and the rainbows danced in her hair <eos> aw yeah <eos> she reminded me of winters morning <eos> what frigid <eos> her perfume as eau de toilette <eos> whats that mean <eos> she was comparable to cleopatra <eos> quite old <eos> shes like shakespeares juliette <eos> what thirteen <eos> the bohemians of soho did pirouettes <eos> as we waltzed through the streets of manhattan <eos> on rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song <eos> theres a girl i described shes as real as the wind <eos> its true i saw her today <eos> the other details are inventions <eos> because i prefer her that way oh oh <eos> its a cold night <eos> beneath the street lights <eos> theres a man whose pants are too tight <eos> oh no his pants are too tight <eos> my pants are too tight <eos> he stands there <eos> an empty stare <eos> trying to make enough money for his cab fare home <eos> hell have to walk home tonight <eos> dont have enough for the ride <eos> the streets are cruel <eos> he tries to act cool <eos> he goes to work with only his work tool <eos> you can put away your tool jermaine <eos> you dont have to be a prostitute <eos> no no no no no <eos> you can say no to being a manho <eos> a male gigalow <eos> you dont have to be a prostitute <eos> no no no no no <eos> you can say no to being a nightlooker a boyhooker a rentboy broho <eos> he cannot see his way out <eos> i cannot my way out <eos> he cant see his way out <eos>

<eos> "shouldnt we have something to eat" <eos> well i say <eos> "there are plenty of fish in the sea" <eos> but all they can see is me <eos> they say "any last requests" <eos> biding my time i say "yes <eos> i want to party just we three <eos> lost but happy at sea" <eos> so we drank all night from the keg <eos> i passed out then awoke with one leg <eos> i said "petrov have you seen my leg" <eos> he said "no" and he went back to bed <eos> but he looked suspiciously well fed <eos> three days later they were hungry again <eos> they said "any last requests again my friend" <eos> i said "do you know any rolling stones <eos> you know like youre at a rock concert going "more more" <eos> "ah it was a hilarious hilarious moment in a very bleak bleak time of my life" <eos> so we danced all night to the rolling stones <eos> when i awoke they were chewing on bones <eos> yelena was supping blood from a cup <eos> thats when i knew something was up <eos> "hey petrov" <eos> "what" <eos> "what is that youre eating" <eos> "nothing" <eos> "it looks like a meat" <eos> "oh this its um one of those um fish" <eos> "how come it looks so much like my arm" <eos> "its an arm fish" <eos> "what about the fingers" <eos> "fish fingers" <eos> "well you see the thing is my arm seems to haveabeen <eos> hacked off at the elbow last night i was just wondering if you might have seen it" <eos> "oh yeah look at that no arm over there <eos> oh dont you hate it when that happens <eos> i dont know um you were very drunk last night <eos> perhaps you lost it in a fair game of chance" <eos> "oh youre probably right" <eos> "yeah you know how it is when were drunk" <eos> "yeah" <eos> "you say ill bet my arm" <eos> "oh" <eos> "just relax enjoy the sea and have some more fish" <eos> four months now lost at sea <eos> my friends have almost finished me <eos> now they are using recipes <eos> tonight we are having some "me goering" <eos> "but wait this you goering is absolutely delicious <eos> you should come over here right away and try some <eos> you really would be proud of yourself" <eos> "how can i you have eaten all of my leg" <eos> "ooh someone obviously isnt getting any" <eos> late that night while they were asleep <eos> i swallowed some arsenic to poison my meat <eos> i was very ill but revenge is so sweet <eos> unlike the last meal my comrades would eat <eos> "yes eat it all up <eos> not so sweet all of a sudden hm" <eos> when i awoke they were already dead <eos> all that was left of me was my head <eos> no not dead just a head <eos> lost but happy at sea <eos> lost but

harder than i thought <eos> your face is distant and paler now <eos> its funny how things work out <eos> but if i keep a constant speed <eos> and watch everything rush past me <eos> its the quickest way to leave it all behind <eos> only it never leaves <eos> im beginning to forget im beginning to forget you <eos> i just see an outline <eos> im beginning to forget im beginning to forget you <eos> i hope thats alright <eos> i miss your kitchen window view <eos> the effect i had on you <eos> your voice is lost in static waves <eos> erased by every day <eos> if i keep a constant speed <eos> and let everything rush past me <eos> this bloody mess i can leave behind <eos> only it never leaves <eos> im beginning to forget <eos> im beginning to forget you <eos> i just see an outline of you <eos> im beginning to forget <eos> im beginning to forget you <eos> i hope thats alright <eos> im beginning to forget <eos> im beginning to forget you <eos> i just see an outline <eos> im beginning to

afraid of leaving <eos> now i dont think i can return yeah <eos> and all along there was a need for change <eos> and so i thought i better leave this place <eos> when all i had to do was change my mind <eos> all i had to do was change my mind <eos> my god <eos> is it alright if i turn right back around <eos> cause i reckon i fly highest <eos> when my feet are planted <eos> on the ground i used to want the morning <eos> you and me just hanging around <eos> but i cant shake this feeling off <eos> cant shake this deadweight off of my back <eos> its a troubled place we scale <eos> but we just break it out <eos> we give too much although <eos> it leaves you cold oh <eos> got no place else to go <eos> in a daze just hanging around <eos> its a dirt ground we crawl upon <eos> ive stared at your face for much too long <eos> its a troubled place we scale <eos> but we just break it out <eos> watch us give too much away <eos> it leaves you cold oh <eos> cold oh cold <eos> i used to want the morning <eos> you and me just hanging around <eos> its a troubled game we stage <eos> where we just wait it out <eos> watch us give too much away <eos> where we just wait it out <eos> and the words you meant to say <eos> and the words i give away <eos> it leaves you cold oh <eos> cold oh cold in the shade of every moment i bled <eos> such a sorrow was to be expected <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> now every feeling it kicks me to the bone <eos> and takes me under to a place that i have known <eos> there goes my quiet life i used to keep me warm <eos> in the shade of this moment i am born <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> in the shade of every moment i bled <eos> such a sorrow was to be expected <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> i let a good thing go <eos> good thing go i hope this letter finds you well <eos> everyone here misses you so <eos> the trees are bare and the swallows have flown <eos> the yard is covered in snow <eos> your dogs are acting crazy we cant figure out why <eos> and me well im thinking of you <eos> all the time <eos> all of the time <eos> almost all of the time <eos> all of the time gemma

fall in love as you walked right by <eos> but i misunderstood <eos> and soon it was enough to know <eos> id never let you go <eos> but its okay <eos> to never be the same <eos> at times it wont be easy <eos> but nothing has to change <eos> were hopeless til the end <eos> do you recall the day <eos> when our hearts were divided <eos> i was quite content <eos> not opening my my eyes <eos> i could never apprehend <eos> what social life intends <eos> quietly alone were all stories in the end <eos> you wanted me to talk <eos> i was happy to comply <eos> thinking all along you were just passing by <eos> but i misunderstood <eos> and soon it was enough <eos> to know id never let you go <eos> but its okay <eos> to never be the same <eos> at times it wont be easy <eos> but nothing has to change

needle drops <eos> the stereo gives <eos> its never too late to learn how to live <eos> weve been waiting around for so long <eos> just to hear some decent songs <eos> well this is all such an urgency <eos> we remember those nights in radio five <eos> when the dance balls kicked us all alive <eos> and i fell in love with the club fortyfive <eos> hey hey hey i remember dreaming as i fell <eos> hey hey hey but there are somethings that mere songs can never tell <eos> the kids in the club are hot enough <eos> the kids in the club are strong enough <eos> the kids at the club are falling in love <eos> the kids at the club are hot enough <eos> the kids at the club are what gets you tough <eos> the kids at the club will rise above <eos> the kids at the club x <eos> anna knew of a little town <eos> the walls are parted and broken down <eos> and i fell in love as i jumped on the bus <eos> oh there are bugs right there on the side <eos> but the bad booker kissed her and tried to hide <eos> the world is so old and i felt so young <eos> hey hey hey i remember shouting to the top <eos> hey hey hey if i could snap my fingers <eos> i could make the whole world stop <eos> the kids in the club are hot enough <eos> the kids at the club hold faintly enough <eos> the kids at the club are falling in love <eos> the kids in the club are hot enough <eos> the kids in the club are faithly enough <eos> the kids at the club will rise above <eos> repeat x <eos> the kids at the club i spent seventeen nights in the city <eos> watching the horizon beckon for a buck knife <eos> to bludgeon its belly to end the pregnancy <eos> ive spent seventeen nights in the city <eos> watching the face in the embryo <eos> traced by fleshy twilight pleading for cesarean <eos> you can see it all from the rooftops <eos> a swollen vagina in the sky <eos> threatening birth <eos> three shades of blood to soak its bed <eos> one fiery red for the shutdown of the science bled sun <eos> two viscous black for the sex lives of the science fed youth <eos> three milk white for the impossible vista of the skyline as it shorted out <eos> crackled with static and was replaced by a network of newsprint <eos> you can see it all from the rooftops <eos> a swollen vagina in the sky <eos> so close you can smell the morphine in its veins mr electric disappears and reappears like a smilingsnarling phantom <eos> dawn wooing the blue from the crawling eyes of babies <eos> midday vanished grinning through the sweat pores of harlots and whores <eos> sundown opening a cloak of tentacles <eos> preaching the gospel of cracked crystal beaks <eos> dusk peeling back the birth skin like wrapping paper around a virgin <eos> vanish again <eos> twilight march on electric children <eos> and you with your self righteous army of crotches spewing paper children <eos> his death hole is deeper <eos> and stronger than love lets sling our rain slicks over februarys fantastic antlers <eos> sprouting from the foreheads of world famous romancers <eos> the winters looming like a bloodthirsty bird of prey <eos> and i guarantee by spring well either be world famous or goddamned dead <eos> guitar one fastens languid years to busty bones like dust and skin on a dull antique moon <eos> guitar twos touch keeps ruining lovers for other lovers <eos> like jokers concealed in trick decks in our laps <eos> theres a train tumbling down torn paper tracks while weeds blossom from heartbeats that lack <eos> guitar threes dancing even though her song stopped playing ages and ages ago <eos> shes at an empty dance club suspended in the middle of a rambling sentence <eos> guitar four says "if you still believe in the grace of man <eos> let me introduce you to greedy greedy hands" <eos> lets sling our rain slicks over every single second <eos> to the rapture dripping from clocks ticking all our misadventures <eos> the winter left town with some seventeenyearold waitress <eos> and springs laying in a pile of all the moments of our misadventures ring out the gong again <eos> carve out this hymn in skin <eos> when the party blacks out again <eos> youre still eating headlines out of the newspaper bin <eos> slap the gong again <eos> carve out this hymn in skin <eos> happy birthday gelatins smearing bruises on your chin <eos> theres cake but no mouth conch but no sound <eos> glossy skeletons boyfriends but no friends <eos> ring out the gong again <eos> carve out this hymn in skin <eos> when theyve pissed between every sheet of your fathers bed <eos> those tears have barcodes waiting to be scannedscammed <eos> and when theyve hurled every gutted couch cushion <eos> from the living room into your fathers swimming pool <eos> youre bobbing chlorine apples in the broth bucket of envys gruel <eos> happy birthday gelatins smearing bruises on your chin <eos> theres cake but no mouth conch but no sound <eos> glossy skeletons boyfriends but no friends <eos> ring ring ring out the gong <eos> son now youve made it to the top of their list <eos> congratulations your fuckings greatest hit <eos> behind husks of leather photo albums sheild their laughter <eos> you thought theyd make you breakfast the morning after <eos> your fantasy season gangrened off the calander the last mariner alive on the ark of the blood brothers <eos> hears the five howls of its haunting <eos> one in the sail when the scales of the oil ocean glow pink <eos> one in the cabin for the swollen navels of pregnant sirens <eos> the fins on the backs of dead pirates <eos> three in the lookout tower for the temptation of cursed pineapples <eos> the deadly lure of piano island <eos> oh oh oh oh oh you never know <eos> the hints of phantom revolt might never ever show <eos> until you find yourself shaved <eos> poisoned and dismembered down the throat of the sea <eos> raise the fucking flag <eos> the flag of mutiny neon black tanks grope the skyline <eos> neon black cocks rot into poison wine <eos> neon black flowers on the mass grave <eos> neon black corpses stacked eclipse the horizon <eos> neon black whip war gang hiss <eos> while devastator sips from the crystal chalice <eos> neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm <eos> culture and opulence <eos> the bayonets clamor on all night hemming scars into the hillside <eos> devastator sleeps under satin sheets <eos> "death campaigns are a fucking gold mine" <eos> and all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along <eos> devastator in a negligee does a strip tease while he sings this song <eos> "everybody needs a little devastation" <eos> neon black dirt in the garden <eos> all the roses blossom into skulls this season <eos> neon black branches hanging from the trees <eos> every limb is empty robbed of pleasant memories <eos> the fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises <eos> devastator violates with dirty fingers <eos> neon black flames cook the calm air <eos> the partys over what was your favorite gift <eos> neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode mr electric we are dying to dine in your house of mirrors <eos> mr electric open your beak we want in the city under <eos> your skins dull glistening when your skyscrapers husk <eos> peel off like coconut crust <eos> we drink deep from the barbiturate brew <eos> when your rape trumpets tune softens like the womb <eos> we drink deep from the barbiturate brew <eos> when your smiles broken shards scrape the film from our hearts <eos> you stuffed our mouths with blasphemy <eos> you wrapped our bones in circuitry <eos> wandering your streets like damp <eos> newspaper tumbling turning in the wind <eos> and the concrete in your sky parts like pink lid eye <eos> watch the fun squeal through its death leather veil <eos> we are dying to dine <eos> when your garden of mirror vomits from the ground <eos> to see our wombs impregnated with fun powder and lead <eos> shot from your siamese love <eos> we know youre watching <eos> we know youre watching <eos> we know youre watching mr electric ocean alice wheres your tongue <eos> she said look in the encyclopedias ceaseless chatter <eos> alice wheres your hair <eos> she said look in the sharp of a wellworn butterfly knife <eos> alice wheres your teeth <eos> she said look at the piano theyre dangling from every single chord <eos> alice wheres your lips <eos> look in the empires roaring the tyrants getting so loud and boring <eos> alice wheres your man <eos> look in this black eye written like the o in the word goodbye <eos> alice wheres your house <eos> its built on the hush of your favorite records screeching halt <eos> alice wheres your clothes <eos> theyll be sweet sheets around your eyes when street boars eat you alive <eos> alice wheres your swans <eos> flying in hotel rooms stealing stereos <eos> mister the skys a contortionist <eos> the streets are skipping records blaring hiss <eos> camouflage camouflage <eos> the citys draped in camouflage <eos> the taxis are jaguars throwing fits <eos> subways are subterranean bullets <eos> camouflage camouflage <eos> the citys draped in camouflage <eos> cant you see the sidewalks are just snakes peeling off last years skin <eos> cant you find your own face shining in the skys false reflection <eos> wheres your voice <eos> wheres your dress <eos> wheres your bones <eos> draped in camouflage <eos> wheres your beach <eos> wheres your sky <eos> wheres your clouds <eos> draped in camouflage <eos> mister the skys a contortionist <eos> the streets are skipping records blaring hiss <eos> camouflage camouflage

give me one good reason not to empty the heart of all its zeros and ones <eos> not to smash that telecaster before it births a thousand useless slums <eos> love bit you in the throat while you were staring at the sea <eos> all the girls in montreal are smashing skateboards in the street <eos> its am and shes at your door with a suitcase in a nightgown <eos> we slip through mansions with fences fullgrown <eos> we slip through streetlights in crooked rows <eos> i saw the sky split in two one half jealous and one half cruel <eos> i felt my chest cave in under a pile of synthetic grins <eos> the fields are dayglo under sobbing rainbows dragged through filthy thoughts <eos> false applause and camouflage <eos> i couldnt see the solar system <eos> it was camouflaged as a tape loop repeating <eos> i couldnt see the glorious meadow <eos> it was camouflaged as a smashed in glass window <eos> i couldnt see the love and affection <eos> it was camouflaged as a jungle of erections <eos> i couldnt see the skeletal lightning <eos> it was camouflaged as a young machete and every soldiers face is burnt <eos> and its a mask or its a flash <eos> and their hands are turned to rifles now <eos> and they kill everything and anything they touch <eos> so watch the trees swaying in the breeze <eos> keeping beat to the butchery <eos> and every subway stations wrecked <eos> it shuts down and off <eos> and business men in a panic "here they come here they come" <eos> and they collect power killing love <eos> so watch the bat <eos> a picnic death camp <eos> keeping beat to the butchery <eos> so children come burn the skyscapers <eos> and the cities alive <eos> come clean within you <eos> and the metronome clicks like new <eos> and the metronome clicks over our skulls <eos> and every single window pane is smashed <eos> and every compass smiling broken glass <eos> heres a place where the soldiers came <eos> to rake up all that they could take <eos> so toss another bottle <eos> pull another pin <eos> light up the sky in a butchery <eos> so children come burn the skyscapers <eos> and the cities alive <eos> come clean within you <eos> and the metronome clicks like new <eos> and the metronome clicks over our skulls <eos> so children come burn the skyscapers <eos> and the cities alive <eos> come clean within you <eos> so children come burn the skyscapers <eos> and the cities alive <eos> come clean within you <eos> and the metronome clicks like new <eos> and the metronome clicks over our skulls fire fire fire <eos> orange yellow and black flesh trees bloom fire fire fire <eos>

faces <eos> parents and school children watch me sit on this neon nest naked <eos> theres a girl in a cage making love to a switchblade <eos> theres a man behind bars milking abandoned cars <eos>

ribcage like a squealing armoire <eos> her lungs and liver screaming mercy mercy mercy <eos> while they re arrange the wires in her heart <eos> i now pronounce you smiling like a grave <eos> i now pronounce you a new york slave <eos> now every dripping chest wound is getting little guilt feelings <eos> what about your new life do you crave <eos> hes your ticket to fame but your his new york

eye of the star studded skysinging <eos> "do you want to live forever baby <eos> do you want to live forever baby <eos> suck the youth stuck forever baby <eos> throb the camera flash forever baby" <eos> the flock of grinning octopi drop like tears <eos> from a varicose thigh singing <eos> "do you want to live forever <eos> nail your crotch to the hive of pleasure" <eos> their hearts strung up like a moustache angel <eos> they pull the screen down and she steps inside <eos> she coos her mouth for the face rearranger <eos> their tentacles puckered ready to fire <eos> tug tug tugthe beard of the octopus <eos> lick lick lick the kiss of the octopus <eos> she wants more she wants more sweet serum to devour the hours <eos> sweat serum to sweeten the sour <eos> sweet serum to devour the hours

watch alone from the waterfront <eos> her newly immortalized face splattered across the sky <eos> like hot human cocaine <eos> she closes her eyes in ecstasy <eos> but mr electric ocean has tattooed his face inside her eyelids when the french maids cigarette turns <eos> burns like a boiling tapeworm <eos> that was really something baby <eos> that was really something baby <eos> when the chandeleers shatter <eos> your guests gowns turn to tatters the portraits just chatter <eos> that was really something baby <eos> that was really something baby <eos> can you feel your sweat beading

materializing" <eos> where are the six nightmares at this costume bash <eos> open your throat look in the raw gash <eos> you hold each other by well groomed hands <eos> mumbling prayers to a neglected jesus <eos> the matradees quiver as they watch you shiver as the mask <eos> and the mouth knit into each other <eos> our laughter was deafining but our lips <eos> but our lips but our lips were trembling <eos> now the lady with the peacock mask <eos> is writhing around in broken monicle glass <eos> imprisoned like a beetle laying on its back <eos> and the man striped up and clawed calico like a cat <eos> is trapped forever looking like that <eos> "all your luxury all your well hidden trash <eos> all your empty wine bottles disguised as class <eos> all the bastard children you pay off <eos> all the money it takes for you to get off <eos> "may i have this dance" <eos> the dark dealer takes your hands <eos> all your memories all your forgotten plansone night stands <eos> they are the

<eos> ambulance why drops the body off at the door step <eos> ambulance x pulls you out of the party <eos> and rubs your freckles like a dj to his records <eos> but ambulance why teaches you the word goodbye <eos> and cuts your hands to show you where you stand <eos> under the monolith of what is love and what is scam what is sun and what is tan <eos> the ambulance angels pull up to your doorstep <eos> the sirens flash emergency <eos> "youd better come quick" <eos> the ambulance angels chisel a crack in your mouth <eos> and then they paint a landscape with your regret and shouts <eos> roll

when you looked into their eyes <eos> and said "no thanks ill take the hooker instead" <eos> youll never see that office again <eos> so when the nurse amputates both of your thighs <eos> come a little bit closer to the mic <eos> and tell us what you miss more your desk or the hungry sky <eos> the ambulance angels pull up to the graveyard <eos> and leave you there bubbling broken sonnets and shards <eos> the ambulance angels notify your next of kin <eos> and show them the scrap book of your operation <eos> his head was a faucet leaking love laughter and lies <eos> all his secret wishes all his world famous sighs <eos> before you remember oh yeah before you give in <eos> just remember were coming back for your children yesterday i shaved every inch of my body and mailed the hair to you <eos>

<eos> was it his smirk laugh <eos> or the ostrich feather taped to his purple hat <eos> he read the lines on your palm <eos> chanting a creole song <eos> "it is soon you will die and angels dont take bribes" <eos> dont linger on the skylgight you smashed between his eyes <eos> just run into the alley <eos> and tell jokes to the bricks and rats <eos> because one mans murder scene is anothers champagne party <eos> one mans butchered spine is a soldiers war decoration <eos> those wolf mechanics flare up again <eos> as you make your way back to the financial district <eos> the subway is a numb field <eos> every dazed boy and girl makes you lick your lips <eos> the girl with the accordion chewing grass like a lamb <eos> she hands you the juicy eye and then she laughs at your pathetic tie <eos> but dont linger on the grin you gouged in her throat <eos> just take the subway home <eos> but the wife and kids twinkle like stuffed dogs <eos> youre like the stormy ocean now <eos>

<eos> the jokes wed share the clothing i would make him <eos> i reach out but as i do he fades away <eos> mrs johnstone <eos> if my child was raised i a palace like this one <eos> he wouldnt have to worry where <eos> his next meal was comin from <eos> his clothing would be <eos> supplied by george henry lee <eos> mrs lyons <eos> hed have all his own toys <eos> and a garden to play in <eos> mrs johnstone <eos> he could make too much noise <eos> without the neighbours complainin <eos> mrs lyons <eos> silver trays to take meals on <eos> mrs johnstone <eos> a bike with both wheels on <eos> mrs lyons <eos> and hed sleep every night <eos> in a bed of his own <eos> mrs johnstone <eos> he wouldnt get into fights <eos> hed leave matches alone <eos> and youd never find him <eos> effin and blindin <eos> and when he grew up <eos> he could never be told <eos> to stand and queue up <eos> for hours on end at the dole <eos> hed grow up to be <eos> mrs lyons mrs johnstone <eos> a credit to me <eos>

narrator <eos> in the name of jesus the thing was done <eos> now theres no going back for anyone <eos> its too late now for feeling torn <eos> theres a pact been sealed <eos> theres a deal been born narrator <eos> theres a few bob in your pocket <eos> and youve got good friends <eos> and it seems that summers never coming to an end <eos> young free and innocent you havent got a care <eos> apart from decidin on the clothes youre gonna wear <eos> the streets turned into paradise <eos> the radios singing dreams <eos> youre innocent immortal youre just fifteen <eos> and whod dare tell the lambs in spring <eos> what fate the later seasons bring <eos> whod tell the girl in the middle of the pair <eos> the price shell have to pay for just being there <eos> but leave them alone let them go and play <eos> they care not for whats at the end of the day <eos> for what is to come for what might have been <eos> life has no ending when youre sweet sixteen <eos> and your friends are with you to talk away the night <eos> or until mrs wang switches off the chippy light <eos> then theres always the corner <eos> and the street lamps glare <eos> an another hour to spend with your friends with her <eos> to share your last cigarette and your secret dream <eos> at the midnight hour <eos> at seventeen <eos> its just another ferry boat a trip to the beach <eos> but everythings possible <eos> the worlds within your reach <eos> an you dont even notice the broken bottles in the sand <eos> the oil in the water and you cant understand <eos> how living could be anything other than a dream <eos> when youre young free and innocent <eos> and just eighteen <eos> and only if the three of them could stay like that forever <eos> and only if we could predict no changes in the weather <eos> and only if we didnt live in life as well as dreams <eos> and only if we could stop and be forever <eos> just eighteen mrs johnstone <eos> mickey dont shoot eddie hes your <eos> brother you had a twin brother i couldnt <eos> afford to keep both of you his mother <eos> couldnt have kids i agreed to give one of you away <eos> mickey <eos> you you why didnt you give me away mam <eos> i could have been i could

the reckoning be delayed <eos> but a debt is a debt and must be paid <eos> mrs lyons <eos> you do know what they say about twins <eos> secretly parted dont you <eos> mrs johnstone <eos> what what <eos> mrs lyons <eos> they say that if either twin learns that he was <eos> one of a pair they shall both immediately die <eos> it means mrs johnstone that these brothers <eos> shall grow up unaware of the others <eos> existence they shall be raised apart and <eos> never ever told what was once the truth you <eos> wont tell anyone about this mrs johnstone <eos> because if you do you will kill

just the same old song <eos> nothing cruel nothing wrong <eos> its just two fools <eos> who know the rules <eos> but break them all <eos> and grasp at half a chance <eos> to play their part <eos> in a light romance <eos> living on the never never <eos> constant as the changing weather <eos> never sure <eos> whos as the door <eos> or the price <eos> youre gonna have to pay <eos> mrs johnstone <eos>

<eos> a prescription note the doctor wrote <eos> for the chronically depressed <eos> and now the tears have stopped <eos> he sits and counts the days to go <eos> and treats his ills with daily pills

heart shaped face <eos> got a heart shaped face <eos> was it a feeling you thought i could dig up or erase <eos> ive seen you changing <eos> ive seen you aging <eos> and i learned how to turn my head <eos> and i learned how to walk away <eos> and the truth never really lives <eos> in the story of words we say <eos> you never needed anyone to expose you to yourself <eos> and you never needed anyone to raise you hell out of your mind <eos> i never wanted to be someone who had to leave it all behind <eos> even still there is no escape for what i face i faced before <eos> have whatever love you wanna have <eos> but i cant be here anymore <eos> there is nothing new <eos> under the sun <eos> there is nothing new <eos> under the sun <eos> heartache ends <eos> heartache ends <eos> heartache ends <eos> and begins again <eos> and begins again <eos> and begins again <eos> heartache ends <eos> heartache ends <eos> heartache ends <eos> and begins <eos> and begins <eos> begins my watch is blurry when i look down at my hands <eos> im just another alive with impossible plans <eos> i turn the lights low but we both know where we are <eos> and when its over what becomes of your pure heart <eos> a love that never seems to curse or to confine <eos> will be forever never lost or too defined <eos> to lose the feeling of an endless searching through <eos> how to have made what is never about me or you <eos> that is the kind of love id always dreamed to be <eos> however painful let it break down all of me <eos> til i am nothing else but the feeling <eos> til i am nothing else but the feeling <eos> becoming true <eos> becoming true <eos> cant help feeling the way that i do <eos> cant help feeling the way that i do <eos> become a prophet <eos> become a fool <eos> ill let the light shine in <eos> ill let the light shine in <eos> ill let the light shine in <eos> may the best of you win <eos> who is your truest friend <eos> are they there at your end <eos> ill let the light be black <eos> and let some tears be shed <eos> do it all over again <eos> ill let the light shine in <eos> its not gonna kill you its not gonna kill you <eos> its not gonna kill you its not gonna kill you <eos> its

everything <eos> to scream the animals to scream the earth <eos> to scream the stars out of our universe <eos> to scream at all back into nothingness <eos> to scream the feeling til theres nothing left <eos> to scream the feeling til theres nothing left <eos> ill close my eyes <eos> ill close my eyes so tightly for the world <eos> til you could change my mind with just a smile <eos> and just before i turn to leave i think <eos> i could use the thoughts youve given me <eos> oh i could use the thoughts youve given me <eos> to sing the animals to sing the earth <eos> to sing the stars into the universe <eos> to sing it all back into something new <eos> to sing for life or myself and leaving you <eos> wish i had the voice of everything sometimes <eos> wish i had the voice of everything <eos> ill close my eyes <eos> ill close my eyes so tightly for the world <eos> oh for the world <eos> oh for the world <eos> oh thought i had a clue it was passing by <eos> thought i had an answer it was just a sigh <eos> thought i had a dream once dont remember why <eos> your voice cut straight through me right down to my bones <eos> like a winters wind it knocked out my soul <eos> thought i had some time here left my watch at home <eos> thought i had ideas once they were all on loan <eos> thought i conquered something then it took me down <eos> what i thought i heard clearly it wasnt sound <eos> thought i felt your heartbeat it was just my counting <eos> and to what thoughts will my life be amounting <eos> i can hear you crying and i am crying too <eos> the world might be lying but so are you <eos> i can see you dancing if youd just take the step <eos> you might still have it in you give yourself the benefit <eos> and dance slow decades toward the sun <eos> even when youre the only one <eos> dont look around <eos> its not right its not wrong <eos> dance because you know the song <eos> i dance because i know this one if you dont feel good about it then turn around <eos> if you really mean it baby stand your ground <eos> no ones gonna take it for you darling its true <eos> no ones gonna make it for you <eos> if you feel like quitting now then try a little harder <eos> the things we need the most they seem to take a little longer <eos> no ones gonna try it for you darling no one <eos> no ones gonna wait there with you <eos> just when you thought you would turn all your lights out it shines <eos> some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind <eos> if you dont believe me you can go ahead and laugh <eos> if youve got a sense of humor youre not so bad <eos> no ones gonna hear it the same as its said <eos> no ones gonna listen to it straight from your head <eos> if you feel like running out then stand in one place <eos> when youre still and when you run theres something to face <eos> no ones gonna see your life through theres no way <eos> i wouldnt want to know what you see every day <eos> if you dont feel good about it then turn around <eos> if you really mean it baby stand your ground <eos> no ones gonna take it for you darling its true <eos> no ones gonna wait there with you <eos> just when you thought you would turn all your lights out it shines <eos> some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind everything is tragic <eos> it all just falls apart <eos> but when i look into your eyes <eos> it pieces up my heart <eos> if i only had an answer <eos> to put it all to bed <eos> i wish sometimes i could take back <eos> every word ive said <eos> i walk back in the night alone <eos> got caught up in my song <eos> forgot where i was sleeping <eos> none of the lights were on <eos> i heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth <eos> i laughed so loud inside myself it all began to hurt <eos> so i turned on a picture show <eos> i disappeared the lines <eos> as memories came flooding in <eos> the tears blew out my eyes <eos> i see an elevator <eos> a moment i am above <eos> i look for you or someone <eos> who can still remind me of <eos> the tight grip and the sun lick <eos> and the calm way of all things summer <eos> when its all here <eos> and its all new <eos> and youre not hungover <eos> fierce and light and young <eos> fierce and light and young <eos> when you dont know that youre wrong <eos> or just how wrong you are <eos> my feet are always heavy <eos> as i head toward the door <eos> i thought wed leave this for ourselves a hundred times before <eos> but i guess were always leaving even when we look the same <eos> and it eases me somehow to know that even this will change <eos> if youve still got some light in you then go before its gone <eos> burn your fire for no witness its the only way its done <eos> fierce and light and young <eos> fierce and light and young <eos> hit the ground and run <eos> hit the ground and run i need advice its true <eos> but i wont hear it from you <eos> i dont remember when <eos> you last cared for the things i did <eos> i wish i could believe <eos> apply all the sides youve seen <eos> or you could be the only one <eos> who knows the truth of me <eos> am i the ugly one <eos> its easy to see past <eos> all of the kindness that youve offered me <eos> it doesnt last <eos> its just a thought ive had <eos> if i could show you how <eos> i came to think this way <eos> maybe youd understand me now <eos> sometimes our enemies <eos> are closer than we think <eos> sometimes the ones we trust <eos> may have to give up listening <eos> i wish it were the same <eos> as it is in my mind <eos> id lie to learn a thing or two <eos> give me a reason why <eos> why am i not ashamed <eos> while i am standing still <eos> you want to move in me like you did before <eos> but ive had my fill <eos> you say your time has changed <eos> that you have faced defeat <eos> we might be older now <eos> but is it changing anything <eos> it could be in a way <eos> weve learned to carry well <eos> oh how i wish i could <eos> remove this doubt i feel somehow <eos> i want the best for you <eos> so i wont look your way <eos> maybe the clouds will clear <eos> and ill be seeing you someday <eos> i wish it were the same <eos> as it is in my mind <eos> i am lighter on my feet <eos> when ive left some things behind i feel so lonesome i could cry <eos> but instead ill pass the time <eos> sitting lonely with somebody lonely too <eos> well theres nothing in the world id rather do <eos> now tell me if you dont feel this way <eos> but all i want all i ever need <eos> is someone out there who believes <eos> sometimes believes <eos> not always believes <eos> sometimes believes <eos> now we dont have to take it to extremes <eos> well keep our hands our legs even our lips apart <eos> but im giving you my heart <eos> my heart <eos> are you giving me your heart <eos> your heart <eos> are you lonely too <eos> are you lonely too <eos> highfive <eos> so am i <eos> all of your life <eos> stuck inside <eos> im stuck too <eos> im stuck with you <eos> do you believe <eos> i do <eos> i do <eos> i do youre gone youre gone <eos> youre with me but youre gone <eos> a feeling once so strong <eos> is now an old and forgotten song <eos> you dont sing so <eos> you dont sing so high and wild <eos> youre here youre here <eos> but your spirits disappeared <eos> off to some place that i dont know <eos> some human thing has squashed your soul <eos> and i dont recognize you <eos> i wish that this could turn our thing to bliss <eos> and we could put our fears aside <eos> and learn to laugh and be alive <eos> and let our bodies be revivedbut you cant <eos> say that you want me <eos> what am i supposed to think thats the truth <eos> well has it ever been easy for you <eos> to stand behind the things that i do <eos> i wait for this to pass <eos> for us to both say at last <eos> on this dark and narrow path <eos> the sun is shining and we remember what it is were living for <eos> im neither innocent or wise when you look me in the eyes <eos> you might as well be blind <eos> you might as well be blind <eos> cause you dont see me anymore <eos> and you <eos> you cant tell me that you love me <eos> when im standing in your way <eos> well this would all be so much easier <eos> if i had nothing more to say <eos> well this would all be so much easier <eos> if i had nothing more to say <eos> if only if only <eos> i had nothing more to say <eos> oh if only if only <eos> i had nothing more to say i quit my dreaming the moment that i found you <eos> i started dancing just to be around you <eos> heres to thinking that it all meant so much more <eos> i kept my mouth shut and opened up the door <eos> i wanted nothing but for this to be the end <eos> for this to never be a tied and empty hand <eos> if all the trouble in my heart would only mend <eos> i lost my dream i lost my reason all again <eos> its not just me for you i have to look out too <eos> i have to save my life <eos> i need some peace of mind <eos> i am the only one now <eos> i am the only one now <eos> i am the only one now <eos> you may not be around <eos> you may not be around <eos> you may not be around all is forgiven <eos> all lies you are forgiven <eos> if theres one thing i fear theres one thing i fear <eos> its knowing youre around <eos> so close but not here <eos> so close oh but not with me here <eos> so close but not with me here <eos> all is forgotten <eos> all is forgotten <eos> i made up my mind i made up my mind <eos> i wasted my time making up my mind <eos> i dont know anything <eos> i dont know anything <eos> i dont know anything <eos> but i love you <eos> yes i do <eos> yes i do <eos> will you ever forgive me <eos> a thousand times through <eos> for loving you <eos> for loving you <eos> for loving you if only all our memories were one <eos> we only had to blink and it was done <eos> if all the world could see it with one eye <eos> in perfect color to the perfect sky <eos> if only we could turn ourselves around <eos> and all the things were looking for were found <eos> if only we grew wiser with each breath <eos> if only we could dance our way to death <eos> if only all our dreams were coming true <eos> maybe thered be some time for me and you <eos> if only all the world could sing along <eos> in perfect rhythm to the perfect song <eos> if only all our hopes were to be here <eos> wed just close our eyes when we want to disappear <eos> if only all the love we needed was gained <eos> if only we could always stay the same <eos> if only we could always stay the same curiosity killed the cat <eos> and im hoping that i dont end up just like that <eos> decisions decisions decisions <eos> in the month of may <eos> but im looking at you and i know its gonna be ok <eos> cause its so easy to fall in love with you <eos> its so easy to

nylon fumble a shaky jaw coz we wore boots and football strips <eos> some strange clothes for a first kiss <eos> and ill point out of sight <eos> the ones that people that dont know dont care a jot for <eos> double hedges a single shop that square of glass that we <eos> wrestled on <eos> i love to come back its making me tall <eos> but when i get there theres nothing at all <eos> owned the foundations and brick by brick you built a home for a family <eos> all those coats on the stand like a cluster people hand in <eos> hand hang at odds with the sods who inhabit them <eos> we marked our heights by the door <eos> and sat the readthrough that september storm <eos> saddar still to return each winter hoping to find <eos> something more than a building full of strangers <eos> the living room soaked up more tears than its had <eos> conversations <eos> i love to come back its making me tall <eos> but when i get there theres nothing at all <eos> owned the foundations and brick by brick you built a home <eos> for a family oh <eos> i love to come back its making me tall <eos> but when i get there theres nothing at all <eos> fly past the red bricks in double time <eos> to find a the secret of nimh as if it never seen that one <eos> heartbeat rises as i go down <eos> down to that beacon in a open ground <eos> a hurricane <eos> heartbeat rises and no surprize <eos> that were got hunger in open eyes <eos> youll be glad that you came <eos> x <eos> heartbeat rises sifted through the library of the lost ten years <eos> and there hasnt i dont suppose been a moment we can hold as close as the night we kicked of your clothes and swam in the salt <eos> i wish a deep and early grave to the collection of moments i caved <eos> whether they were minute or massive waves <eos> as i lay in the bed we made swallowed whore <eos> soon well leave this place for not a full stop but parentheses <eos> the most lovely of life sentences <eos> all i wanted was to mention this youre here in

still sleeping <eos> yellow sun brings the dawn <eos> mother earth is weeping <eos> i kick off my sensible shoes <eos> i clear away the table <eos> i switch on the morning news <eos> economys unstable <eos> but its all gonna be all right <eos> last time you said you might <eos> baby can i see you tonight <eos> i look up in the cloudless sky <eos> were hardly even moving <eos> this days just creeping by <eos> and its not of my choosing <eos> i wish i had a a time machine <eos> to move a little faster <eos> id cut to the crucial scene <eos> between before and after <eos> everythin gonna be all right <eos> last time you said you might <eos> baby can i see you tonight <eos> took a walk down by the wall <eos> down by the harbor <eos> theres no wind blowing in my sail <eos> makes it even harder <eos> you whispered "can i take it slow" <eos> i will if i am able <eos> i can feel it head to toe <eos> theres no name or label <eos> and everythin gonna be all right <eos> last time you said you might <eos> baby can i see you tonight <eos> i dont know just where you are <eos> but i can use my imagination <eos> its hard to say how deep i fell <eos> its more than fascination <eos> i gave up on across and down <eos> i lost my concentration <eos> i feel like a a fallen king <eos> before my abdication <eos> but everythin gonna be all right <eos> last time you said you might <eos> baby can i see you tonight <eos> can i see you tonight <eos> can i see you tonight or before <eos> i got a pretty clear day thought id never reach the water <eos> had to cross the desert and the great divide <eos> drinking only golden promises <eos> with white lines in my eyes <eos> oh sons and daughters <eos> followed all the signs to paradise <eos> believing only dreams and promises <eos> with starlight in their eyes <eos> chorus <eos> oh california <eos> its the one big love that you cannot end <eos> oh california <eos> its not like before but we can still pretend <eos> i was swimming in freezing water <eos> i could hear the music from the other side <eos> looked up and i saw my father <eos> and tears were in his eyes <eos> chorus <eos> we all still live for friday night <eos> old habits die hard when you get them right <eos> theres a broken dream in every grain of sand <eos> but its as close as i can get to the promised land <eos> oh california <eos> i can see you now from the top of that hill <eos> oh california <eos> though many have gone i have the memories still <eos> oh california <eos> i can hear the sound of the mission bell <eos> oh california <eos> were one stones throw from heaven <eos> thought id never reach the water <eos> had to cross the desert and the great divide <eos> drinking only golden promises <eos> with white lines in my eyes <eos> oh california <eos> its the one big love that you cannot end <eos> oh california <eos> yeah i cant leave you now <eos> oh california instrumental well hello <eos> youll have to excuse me <eos> i just turned out the light <eos> i was dreaming <eos> youre the last person id expected to be here <eos> when i came home <eos> there was a message on the phone <eos> it said to come over <eos> but it was too late so i left you alone <eos> and yes im doing fine <eos> and thanks for asking <eos> its been a long time <eos> you know time keeps passing <eos> you said that you called me to hear the sound of my voice <eos> at least i still got something that works on you <eos> you know you make me crazy <eos> when you speak so lazy <eos> so what is it that you want <eos> you have my ear <eos> and you you can be cruel <eos> why did you call me <eos> i am no fool <eos> you sound so lonely <eos> hows your new boy <eos> does he take you dancing <eos> i can believe his name is roy <eos> can this be love you found <eos> and dont ask me what happened <eos> cuz i still dont know <eos> one minute we were laughing <eos> and then you walked out the door <eos> well <eos> sometimes im up and sometimes im falling down <eos> lately my luck has been draging on the ground did someone call my name <eos> like a distant drum is beating <eos> or is it just another dream along of long ago <eos> i dance again i am spinning <eos> in the light i am living <eos> and i can feel the power rushing through my veins <eos> once upon a time i could do no wrong <eos> for the candle flickers the flame is never gone <eos> to my brilliant feat <eos> they all pay heed <eos> i hear the crowds roar oh so loudly <eos> is it a game of chance <eos> or merely circumstances <eos> a jack to a king and back <eos> then you have to pay to play <eos> the world it wont wait for you <eos> its got its own things to do <eos> the suns gotta rise and drive another night away <eos> and as i listen to the silence <eos> i can hear thunder in the distance <eos> to my brilliant feat <eos> they all pay heed <eos> i hear the crowds roar oh so loudly dont wait up <eos> for her tonight <eos> cause she wont be coming home <eos> dont wake up <eos> till it gets light <eos> by then shell be long gone <eos> a restless heart has set its sail <eos> she can feel the waves washing over <eos> she knows what life with you entails <eos> you love her strength you despise your weakness <eos> dont wait up <eos> for her tonight <eos> cause she wont be coming home <eos> dont wake up <eos> till it gets light <eos> the dogs are scratching at the door <eos> your jealous heart has won the day <eos> you can feel the darkness creeping over <eos> she paid the man and sailed away <eos> leaving you your incompleteness i dont know why <eos> why you had to leave me <eos> and i dont know why <eos> you said goodbye <eos> only if i try <eos> can i feel the earth beneath me <eos> and as days go by <eos> i come alive <eos> the fall of your hair <eos> the feel of your skin <eos> and the smile on your face <eos> as you took me in <eos> now i lie <eos> and stare at the sky <eos> still i wonder why <eos> i dont know why <eos> you said that youd release me <eos> no matter how i try <eos> i still feel you <eos> i watched a falling leaf <eos> drifting down towards me <eos> carried by the wind <eos> it disappeared <eos> i sat in disbelief <eos> at what had become of me <eos> and as the day grew dark <eos> i rose to go <eos> and as i walked along <eos> i thought i heard you call me <eos> alas i was alone <eos> so i went home <eos> the fall of your hair <eos> the feel of your skin <eos> and the smile on your face <eos> as you took me in <eos> now i lie <eos> no longer cry <eos> but still i wonder why <eos> i dont know why <eos> you were taken from me <eos> i cannot forget <eos> or say goodbye sometimes im invisible im nowhere to be seen <eos> and kick like a tin can in the shape of a man <eos> trying so hard to break in so i can burst out <eos> perspectives ever changing leaving me in doubt <eos> ive got a chronic disorder im balanced between <eos> the edge of a razor trying to cut clean <eos> ive got my eyes on the road im trying to keep steady <eos> ive got my hands on the wheel <eos> i feel im nearly ready <eos> hope that me whos dreaming and thats not me whos screaming <eos> want to wake up warm in a tattered down tarn <eos> still for all the killing theres nobody winning <eos> i want to spit it out i want to scream and shout <eos> lying in the gutter i heard someone mutter <eos> well creep in the shadows trying to get home <eos> like the swing in the seesaw hard to keep steady <eos> with some rearranging <eos> i feel im nearly ready <eos> sometimes im invisible im nowhere to be seen <eos> kick like a tin can into a sugared man <eos> hope that me whos dreaming and thats not me whos screaming <eos> i want to wake up warm in a tattered down tarn <eos> lying in the gutter i heard someone mutter <eos> well creep in the shadows trying to get home <eos> ive got my eyes on the road im trying to keep steady <eos> ive got my hand my hands on the wheel <eos> i feel im nearly ready when i first set eyes on you <eos> first you beat me up <eos> then you kissed me too <eos> wed throw stones into the sea <eos> there were no others there <eos> just you and me <eos> across the bridge <eos> and down the lane <eos> i knew i loved you then <eos> you said you did the same <eos> oh maggie <eos> what have you done <eos> i should have seen it coming <eos> and to your side id run <eos> oh maggie <eos> come to me tonight <eos> i will wait up for you <eos> make sure youre alright <eos> i miss you <eos> you taught me how to sink or swim <eos> when i was scared that day <eos> you just pushed me in <eos> and when nobody was around <eos> you let me kiss you then <eos> and there the love i found <eos> i said id never let you go <eos> you just smiled at me <eos> how was i to know <eos> oh maggie <eos> what am i to do <eos> how can i live with only memories of you <eos> oh maggie <eos> tell me the truth <eos> when your ship was sinking <eos> did you think it through <eos> i miss you <eos> you were the fountain of my youth <eos> and when i fumbled <eos> you showed me what to do <eos> and when we were both <eos> you left me standing there <eos> but you were never mean <eos> and when i saw you out with him <eos> he looked much older <eos> and you looked very thin <eos> i hadnt heard from you in years <eos> and then your mama called <eos> she couldnt speak for tears <eos> she said you left me a note <eos> inside my pocket burns <eos> with these words you wrote <eos> hey darlin boy <eos> dont you cry for me <eos> i am forever yours <eos> now that i am free <eos> well be together <eos> throw stones into the sea <eos> therell be no others there <eos> just you and me <eos> i miss you <eos> maggies gone <eos> i think you came the other night <eos> you stroked my brow <eos> your eyes were full of light <eos> it may have only been a dream <eos> when i will walk with you <eos> to places i never have been <eos> maggies gone get out of hollywood <eos> drive into the hills <eos> roll down the top <eos> and just throw away your pills <eos> youll never forget her <eos> so why do you even try <eos> thingsll get easier <eos> as the days go creeping by <eos> broke my heart <eos> saw it coming from the start <eos> i really hate to see the shape im in <eos> broke all the rules <eos> and you know life can be cruel <eos> but i think its time i learned to swim <eos> show me <eos> there still can be some mystery <eos> i havent found <eos> throw me <eos> a lifeline to the lost at sea <eos> dont let me drown <eos> and if i had my way <eos> tell you what id do <eos> drive down to the lake <eos> before

dream of lying in the sun <eos> in my ears hear the ocean roaring <eos> like all good wayfaring sons <eos> i traveled home <eos> and the rain is pouring <eos> soaks me to my skin <eos> i duck into this public house <eos> get shattered by the din <eos> i sailed across the sea <eos> my family and me <eos> i never knew if id return <eos> but in my memory i learned <eos> so here we are once again <eos> with my friends and the whiskeys flowing <eos> and as the cold night air descends <eos> i drift away <eos> and my mind it wanders <eos> back to southern skies <eos> i call myself a fool <eos> i hope i wake and realize <eos> incomprehensible <eos> some people they get maimed <eos> yes round the world ive been <eos> no two places are the same <eos> i dream of lying in the sun <eos> in my ears hear the ocean roaring <eos> like all good wayfaring sons <eos> i traveled home <eos> with some more good stories <eos> i build them up through time <eos> theyll all become a pack of lies <eos> when im beyond my prime this boy and girl were lovers <eos> came from different towns <eos> now they both live in the same one <eos> see each other round <eos> he saw her at the rose bowl <eos> just the other day <eos> she showed him what she bought there <eos> and they struggled for what to say <eos> they say were made mostly of water <eos> so how come we cant find the sea <eos> they say true love creeps up on you slowly <eos> oh how blind some people can be <eos> this boy and girl had troubles <eos> lasted fifteen rounds <eos> both threw in the towel <eos> no one took the crown <eos> and time it tends to pass us <eos> as we look the other way <eos> now he sells insurance <eos> and shes in a nonunion play <eos> oh how i wish we were like water <eos> wed float on down into the sea <eos> if you find true love at your door knocking <eos> invite her in make her some tea <eos> this boy and girl were lovers <eos> came from different towns <eos> now they both live in the same one <eos> see each other round <eos> they say were made mostly of water <eos> so how come we cant find the sea <eos> they say true love creeps up on you slowly <eos> oh how blind some people can be clock strikes

broken toys lie on the floor <eos> theres no more laughter from down the hall <eos> mirror mirror mirror on the wall <eos> whatever could have happened to them all <eos> to the children on parade

<eos> without you here there is less to say <eos> dont want you thinking im unhappy <eos> what is closer to the truth <eos> is that if i lived till i was a hundred and two <eos> i just dont think ill ever get over you <eos> im no longer moved to drink strong whiskey <eos> i shook the hand of time and i knew <eos> that if i lived till i could no longer climb my stairs <eos> i just dont think ill ever get over you <eos> your face it dances and it haunts me <eos> your laughter is still ringing in my ears <eos> i still find pieces of your presence here <eos> even after all these years <eos> i dont want you thinking that i dont get asked to dinner <eos> cause im here to say that i sometimes do <eos> and even though i may seem to feel a touch of love <eos> i just dont think ill ever get over you <eos> if i live till i was a hundred and two <eos> i just dont think ill ever get over you the people allow this last great congregation <eos> i tip my hat to the ones that went before <eos> my secret voice has the inside information <eos> to let the freedom bell ring once and for all <eos> they were singing <eos> i got to fill my heart with pure love <eos> pure love <eos> i got to fill my heart with pure love <eos> around here its the same old situation <eos> fire and wind and the rivers running red <eos> cant wash away the pain of a thousand generations <eos> or the angel child awakened from the dead <eos> and were singing <eos> you got to fill your heart with pure love <eos> you got to fill your heart <eos> you got to fill your heart with pure love <eos> pure love <eos> listen to the band sanctify <eos> we got to fill our hearts with pure love <eos> we got to fill our hearts with pure love <eos> we got to fill our hearts with pure love <eos> we got to fill our hearts with pure love <eos> we got to fill our hearts with pure love a moment of your time now <eos> as mine is closing in on me <eos> a simple farewell rhyme to <eos> anyone who hears me <eos> i have walked

love her <eos> she says that she will miss me <eos> tomorrow they will burn me <eos> they say that it will cause no pain <eos> but what greatly concerns me <eos> is who of them would really know <eos> thy kingdom come <eos> thy will be done <eos> on earth as it is in heaven <eos> with one more setting sun <eos> and dinner just for one <eos> oh lord please give me courage <eos> and as the night grows darker <eos> my fear it now surrounds me <eos> i wish i could be stronger <eos> oh sister can you hear me <eos> take this wretched soul <eos> try to make it whole <eos> its true i have been a

tried talking to jesus but he just put me on hold <eos> said hed been swamped by calls this week <eos> and he could not shake his cold <eos> and still this emptiness persists <eos> perhaps this is as

<eos> yeah this is as good as it gets <eos> my my my its a beautiful world <eos> i like sleeping with marie <eos> she is one sexy girl full of mystery <eos> she says she doesnt love me but she likes

in this finest hour <eos> whistle your favorite tune <eos> well send a card and a flower saying <eos> its a mistake its a mistake <eos> its a mistake its a mistake i cant get to sleep <eos> i think about the implications <eos> of diving in too deep <eos> and possibly the complications <eos> especially at night <eos> i worry over situations <eos> i know will be alright <eos> perhaps its just imagination <eos> day after day it reappears <eos> night after night my heartbeat shows the fear <eos> ghosts appear and fade away <eos> alone between the sheets <eos> only brings exasperation <eos> its time to walk the streets <eos> smell the desperation <eos> at least theres pretty lights <eos> and though theres little variation <eos> it nullifies the night from overkill <eos> day after day it reappears <eos> night after night my heartbeat shows the fear <eos> ghosts appear and fade away <eos> come back another day <eos> i cant get to sleep <eos> i think about the implications <eos> of diving in too deep <eos> and possibly the complications <eos> especially at night <eos> i worry over situations <eos> i know will be alright <eos> its just overkill <eos> day after day it reappears <eos> night after night my heartbeat shows the fear <eos> ghosts appear and fade away <eos> ghosts appear and fade away <eos> ghosts appear and fade away traveling in a friedout combie <eos> on a hippie trail head full of zombie <eos> i met a strange lady she made me nervous <eos> she took me in and gave me breakfast <eos> and she said <eos> do you come from a land down under <eos> where women glow and men plunder <eos> cant you hear cant you hear the thunder <eos> you better run you better take cover <eos> buying bread from a man in brussels <eos> he was six foot four and full of muscles <eos> i said "do you speaka my language" <eos> he just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich <eos> and he said <eos> i come from a land down under <eos> where beer does flow and men chunder <eos> cant you hear cant you hear the thunder <eos> you better run you better take cover <eos> lying in a den in bombay <eos> with a slack jaw and not much to say <eos> i said to the man "are you trying to tempt me <eos> because i come from the land of plenty" <eos> and he said <eos> oh do you come from a land down under <eos> oh yeah yeah <eos> where women glow and men plunder <eos> cant you hear cant you hear the thunder <eos> you better run you better take cover trying to take that midnight train <eos> but its gone and broken down again <eos> now im stuck on empty avenue <eos> trying to get to you <eos> talking on the telephone <eos> only makes me feel more alone <eos> killing time with a chosen few <eos> trying to get to you <eos> in this world of constant danger <eos> i still look for kindness in strangers <eos> and why oh why and why is not enough <eos> and we cry oh cry our tears are not enough <eos> through firestorms and hurricanes <eos> im hours on an airplane <eos> thousand miles of ocean view <eos> trying to get to you <eos> in this world of constant danger <eos> i still look for kindness in strangers <eos> and why oh why and why is not enough <eos> and we cry oh cry our tears are not enough <eos> walking through the driving rain <eos> just the thought of you remains <eos> lines are down i cant get through <eos> trying to get to you <eos> lines are down i cant get through <eos> trying to get to you id be glad to give back <eos> all i have ever owned <eos> if i could have seen into the future <eos> if only i had known <eos> behind these walls of separation <eos> i have learned to live alone <eos> but i want you i want you back <eos> i could clearly see the letters <eos> but not the writing on the wall <eos> about what had come between us <eos> how the mighty fall <eos> and one thing keeps repeating <eos> is the only thing i know <eos> that i want you i want you back <eos> yeah i want you i want you back <eos> well i have taken that number <eos> how can i have been so blind <eos> now i am coming up from under <eos> its you i have to find <eos> my back is all up against the ropes <eos> only one way i can go <eos> and i want you <eos> how far is the distance <eos> have you gone beyond the sign <eos> have you passed the point of no return <eos> have you crossed that line <eos> and if it burns me like a fever <eos> ive got to tell you one last time <eos> that i want you i want you back <eos> yeah i want you i want you back looks like this may well be it yeah were goin down <eos> oceans fast approaching and theres this screeching sound <eos> they found that little ol black box that they all listened to <eos> the last words that were spoken were "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> i was knocking on the pearly gates made of precious stone <eos> looked kind of other worldly inside there was a throne <eos> i was let in by a stranger who id seen somewhere before <eos> i thought well itll come to me here in the evermore <eos> suddenly from out of nowhere a vision did appear <eos> it was my old granddaddy he said "son what are you doin here" <eos> "well it wasnt in my plans you know i done come unstuck <eos> i played out all my hand and i just ran all out of luck" <eos> he said "well if you cant pot the black and you know its not the cue <eos> it may be time to ask yourself what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> now you may well just find yourself on the ballroom floor <eos> you know you cannot get away you cannot reach the door <eos> just try to relax yourself and sit down on your hips <eos> you dont have to move too much and try no to lick your lips <eos> if things seem to be working and she hasnt moved away <eos> you can breathe a little easier and think of what to say <eos> if you spin around and she is gone and you know its not with you <eos> then you have to ask yourself "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> i was standing by a house at night going up in flames and smoke <eos> i was losing everything it really was no joke <eos> to cap it off im naked and theres people all around <eos> i could see an old dog barking but i couldnt hear the sound <eos> the only thing that i could hear which came out of the blue <eos> was the voice inside my own head saying "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> as luck would sometimes have it the good lord was in my dream <eos> he was smiling sweetly and was wearing lincoln green <eos> i asked if he would come again if the rumours were all true <eos> he thought awhile and spoke and said now "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> and as the lights they all came down i was standing by the stage <eos> he was cloaked in darkness and his face it showed no age <eos> i took one step closer just to get a better view <eos> i swear i saw him smile and say now "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> then i suddenly awakened and i simply cant pretend <eos> to understand the way of things and how it all may end <eos> but if the questions simple say do i wear red or blue <eos> now theyre are times you ask yourself "what would bob do" <eos> what would bob do what would bob do <eos> what would bob do what would bob do well i loved the lone ranger and i loved that dennis law <eos> him and george best sure knew how a kick a ball <eos> i wanted tae be a cowboy and learn a crack a whip <eos> stand up in that lonely street two six guns on my hip <eos> along the mighty beatles came and everyone went ahhh <eos> they could play and sing and everything and of course that john could draw <eos> well that was it for me i never once looked back <eos> tricks to learn waves to catch had a plan of attack <eos> are you lookin at me <eos> are you lookin at me <eos> are you lookin at me <eos> are you lookin at me pal <eos> then we headed south where the surf came crashing in <eos> from black and white to colour from innocence to sin <eos> it was summer in december blowing heatwaves in my mind <eos> people talking funny

<eos> cant remember how it goes <eos> i stayed drunk and fell awake <eos> i was cycling on a plane <eos> and far away i heard you say you liked me <eos> we drifted to a party cool <eos> the people went to arty school <eos> they made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade <eos> chorus <eos> in my brain <eos> i rearrange <eos> the letters on the page <eos> to spell your name <eos> i found an ezra pound <eos> and made a bet that if i found <eos> a cigarette id drop it all and marry you <eos> just then a song comes on <eos> "you cant always get what you want" <eos> the rolling stones oh woe is we the irony <eos> the stones became the moss <eos> and once all inhibitions lost <eos> the hipsters made a mission to the farm <eos> we drove by tractor there <eos> the yellow straw replaced our hair <eos> we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth <eos> in my brain <eos> i rearrange <eos> the letters on the page <eos> to spell your name <eos> you said "we only live once" <eos> so we touched a little tongue <eos> and instantly i wanted to <eos> i lost my train of thought <eos> and jumped aboard the epping as <eos> the doors were slowly closing on the world <eos> i touched on and off <eos> and rubbed my arm up against yours <eos> and still the inspector inspected me <eos> the lady in the roof <eos> was living proof that nothing <eos> really ever is exactly as it seems <eos> in my brain <eos> i rearrange <eos> the letters on the page <eos> to spell your name <eos> we caught the river boat downstream <eos> and ended up beside a team <eos> of angry footballers <eos> i fed the ducks some krill <eos> then we were sucked against our will <eos> into the welcome doors of the casino <eos> we drank green margaritas <eos> danced with sweet senoritas <eos> and we all went home as winners of a kind <eos> you said "i guarantee well have more fun <eos> drink till the moon becomes the sun <eos> and in the taxi home ill sing you a triffids song" <eos> in my brain <eos> i rearrange <eos> the letters on the page <eos> to spell your name i sleep in late <eos> another day <eos> oh what a wonder <eos> oh what a waste <eos> its a monday <eos> its so mundane <eos> what exciting things <eos> will happen today <eos> the yard is full of hard rubbish its a mess and <eos> i guess the neighbors must think we run a meth lab <eos> we should amend that <eos> i pull the sheets back <eos> its degrees <eos> and i feel like im dying <eos> lifes getting hard in here <eos> so i do some gardening <eos> anything to take my mind away from where its supposed to be <eos> the nice lady next door talks of green beds <eos> and all the nice things that she wants to plant in them <eos> i wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps <eos> sunflowers bean sprouts sweet corn and radishes <eos> i feel proactive <eos> i pull out weeds <eos> all of a sudden <eos> im having trouble breathing in <eos> im having trouble breathing in <eos> im having trouble breathing in <eos> im having trouble breathing in <eos> my hands are shaky <eos> my knees are weak <eos> i cant seem to stand <eos> on my own two feet <eos> im breathing but im wheezing <eos> feel like im emphysemin <eos> my throat feels like a funnel <eos> filled with weet bix and kerosene and <eos> oh no next thing i know <eos> they call up triple o <eos> id rather die than owe the hospital <eos> till i get old <eos> i get adrenalin <eos> straight to the heart <eos> i feel like uma thurman <eos> postoverdosing kick start <eos> reminds me of the time <eos> when i was really sick and i <eos> had too much psuedoefedryn and i <eos> couldnt sleep at night <eos> halfway down high street andy looks ambivalent <eos> hes probably wondering what im doing getting in an ambulance <eos> the paramedic thinks im clever cos i play guitar <eos> i think shes clever cos she stops people dying <eos> anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic <eos> shouldve stayed in bed today <eos> i much prefer the mundane <eos> i take a hit from <eos> an asthma puffer <eos> i do it wrong <eos> i was never good at smoking bongs <eos> im not that good at breathing in <eos> im not that good at breathing in <eos> im not that good at breathing in you said you liked me at a party <eos> i said oh well um <eos> your flatmate was drinking whiskey <eos> you asked me to get you some <eos> i stole your key from your apartment <eos> so youd have to come around <eos> stuffed balls of cotton to my sneakers <eos> so i wouldnt make a sound <eos> i disconnected the gas heating <eos> then suggested movie nights <eos> it got colder you moved closer <eos> so i cooked us party pie <eos> and i did everything to not let you know i liked you <eos> and everything to let you know that i was still around <eos> like swapping chairs and coughing loudly <eos> putting on your favorite songs <eos> standing hidden in the pantry <eos> hoping you would come along <eos> like tracing lines into a napkin <eos> to the shadows of your face <eos> like dropping you to choir practice <eos> on my u study break <eos> and i did everything to not let you know i liked you <eos> and everything to let you know that i was still around <eos> outside the party it was raining <eos> you were hailing me a cab <eos> i had a plane at seventhirty <eos> rain was dripping down my back <eos> im pretty sure you said you liked me <eos> but a bottle smashed somewhere <eos> you lent me your road map of melbourne <eos> i pretended not to care <eos> and i cant stop thinking about what would have happened <eos> if i hadnt gone to melbourne and gone out to your party <eos> even though you didnt want me to <eos> i just want you to know <eos> theres still a spot left on my key ring <eos> just for you i saw you in the lane next to me <eos> you were doing freestyle then you switched it around <eos> to a little bit of backstroke <eos> i couldnt see underneath <eos> your swimming cap but it appeared that you had <eos> dark colored hair maybe it was blonde for all i know <eos> i had goggles on <eos> they were getting foggy <eos> i much prefer swimming to jogging <eos> i tried my very best to impress you <eos> held my breath longer than i normally do <eos> i was getting dizzy <eos> my hair was wet and frizzy <eos> felt my muscles burn i took a tumble turn <eos> for the worse its a curse <eos> my lack of athleticism sunk like a stone <eos> like a first owners home loan <eos> when i came to you and your towel were gone watermarks on the ceiling <eos> i can see jesus <eos> and hes frowning at me <eos> i see a dead seal on the beach <eos> the old man says hes "already saved it three times this week <eos> guess it just wants to die <eos> i would wanna die too he said <eos> with people putting oil into my air <eos> but to be fair ive done my share <eos> guess everybodys got their different point of view" <eos> i was driving down sun set strip <eos> phillip island not los angeles <eos> got me some hot chips <eos> and a cool drink <eos> took a sandy seat on the shore <eos> theres a paper on the ground <eos> it makes my headache quite profound <eos> as i read it out aloud <eos> it said "the great barrier reef it aint so great anymore <eos> its been raped beyond belief the dredgers treat it like a whore" <eos> drank till i was sinking <eos> sank till i was thinking <eos> that im thankful for this view <eos> drank till i was sinking <eos> sank till i was thinking <eos> that im thankful for this view <eos> we either think that were invincible <eos> or that we are invisible <eos> but realistically were somewhere in between <eos> we all think that we are nobody <eos> but everybody is somebody elses somebody <eos> dont ask me what i really mean <eos> i am just a reflection <eos> of what you really wanna see <eos> so take what you want from me <eos> so take what you want from me <eos> so take what you want from me <eos> so take what you want from me <eos> so take what you want from me you always get what you want <eos> and you

heart on my sleeve <eos> gets harder in the winter gotta be a fake or shiver <eos> it takes a great deal out of me <eos> yes i like hearing your stories <eos> but ive heard them all before <eos> id rather stay in bed with the rain over my head <eos> than have to pick my brain up off of the floor <eos> i wanna go out but i wanna stay home tell me when youre getting bored and ill leave <eos> im not the one who put the chain around your feet <eos> im sorry for all of my insecurities but its just part of me <eos> envy is thin because it bites but never eats <eos> thats what a nice old spanish lady once told me <eos> hey debbie downer turn that frown upside down and just be happy <eos> i dont ask too much of you its true <eos> and i cant read your mind <eos> dont stop listening im not

small success <eos> but i digress at least ive tried my very best i guess <eos> this that the other why even bother <eos> it wont be with me on my deathbed but ill still be in your head <eos> put me on a pedestal and ill only disappoint you <eos> tell me im exceptional i promise to exploit you <eos> give me all your money and ill make some origami honey <eos> i think youre a joke but i dont find you very funny <eos> my internal monologue is saturated analog <eos> its scratched and drifting ive become attached to the idea <eos> its all a shifting dream bittersweet philosophy <eos> ive got no idea how i even got here <eos> im resentful im having an existential time crisis <eos> want bliss daylight savings wont fix this mess <eos> underworked and oversexed i must express my disinterest

money and ill make some origami honey <eos> i think youre a joke but i dont find you very funny <eos> i wanna wash out my head with turpentine cyanide <eos> i dislike this internal diatribe when i try to catch your eye <eos> i hate seeing you cry in the kitchen <eos> i dont know why it affects me like this <eos> when youre not even mine to consider <eos> erroneous harmonious im hardly sanctimonious <eos> dirty clothes i suppose we all outgrow ourselves <eos> im a fake im a phoney im awake im alone <eos> im homely im a scorpio <eos> put me on a pedestal and ill only disappoint you <eos> tell me

at four <eos> staring at the wall <eos> counting all the cracks backwards <eos> in my best french <eos> reminds me of a book i skim <eos> read in a surgery <eos> all about palmistry <eos> i wonder whats in store for me <eos> i pretend the plaster <eos> is the skin on my palms <eos> and the cracks are representative <eos> of what is going on <eos> i lose a breath <eos> my love line seems entwined with death <eos> could be a spider web <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> i lay awake at three <eos> staring at the ceiling <eos> its a kind of offwhite <eos> maybe its a cream <eos> theres oily residue <eos> seeping from the kitchen <eos> its artdeconecromanticchic <eos> all the dinner plates are kitsch with irish wolfhounds <eos> french baguettes wrapped loose around their necks <eos> i think im hungry <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you <eos> wondering what youre doing <eos> what youre listening to <eos> which quarter of the moon <eos> youre viewing from the bedroom <eos> watching all the movies <eos> drinking all the smoothies <eos> swimming at the pool <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you too <eos> im thinking of you i saw you in the lane next to me <eos> you were doing freestyle <eos> then

growing <eos> all different sizes and all shades of green <eos> slashing it down just seems kinda mean <eos> in a way its a shame <eos> you get away thinking its just a game <eos> who am i to deny myself a pawn for you to use <eos> at the end of the day <eos> its a pain that i keep seeing your name <eos> but im sure its a bore being you <eos> i dont know quite who i am <eos> oh but man i am trying <eos> i make mistakes until i get it right <eos> an eye for an eye <eos> for an eye for an eye <eos> i dont agree with that <eos> why cant we just talk nice <eos> oh the calamity <eos> i wanna

insists that we buy organic vegetables and <eos> i must admit that i was a little skeptical at first <eos> a little pesticide cant hurt <eos> never having too much money <eos> i get the cheap stuff at the supermarket <eos> but theyre all pumped up with shit <eos> a friend told me that they stick nicotine in the apples <eos> if you cant see me i cant see you <eos> heading down the highway hume <eos> somewhere at the end of june <eos> taxidermied kangaroos <eos> are littered on the shoulders <eos> a possum jackson pollock <eos> is painted on the tar <eos> sometimes i think a single sneeze <eos> could be the end of us <eos> my hayfever is turning up <eos> just swerved into a passing truck <eos> big business overtaking <eos> without indicating <eos> he passes on the right <eos> been driving through the night <eos> to bring us the best price <eos> if you cant see me i cant see you <eos> more people die on the road <eos> than they do in the ocean <eos> maybe we should mull over <eos> culling cars instead of sharks <eos> or just lock them up in parks <eos> where we can go and view them <eos> theres a bypass over holbrook now <eos> paid for with burgers no doubt <eos> ive lost count of all the cows <eos> therell be no salad sandwiches <eos> the law of averages says <eos> well stop in the next town <eos> where petrol price is down <eos> what do i know anyhow <eos> if you cant see me i cant see you oliver paul twenty years old <eos> thick head of hair worries hes going bald <eos> wakes up at a quarter past nine <eos> fare evades his way down the tram line <eos> breakfast on the run again <eos> hes well aware hes dropping soy <eos> linseed vegemite crumbs everywhere <eos> feeling sick at the sight of his computer <eos> he dodges his way through the swanston commuters <eos> rips off his tie hands it to a homeless man <eos> sleeping in the corner of a metro bus stand <eos> he screams "im not going to work today <eos> gonna count the minutes that the trains run late <eos> sit on the grass building pyramids out of coke cans" <eos> headphone wielding to the nicholas building <eos> he trips on a pothole thats not been filled in <eos> he waits for an elevator to <eos> a lady walks in and waits by his side <eos> her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin <eos> hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton <eos> vickers perfume on her breath <eos> a tortoiseshell necklace between her breasts <eos> she looks him up and down with a botox frown <eos> hes well used to that look by now <eos> the elevator dings and they awkwardly step in <eos> their fingers touch on the rooftop button <eos> "dont jump little boy dont jump off that roof <eos> youve got your whole life ahead of you <eos> youre still in your youth <eos> id give anything to have skin like you" <eos> he said "i think youre projecting <eos> the way that youre feeling <eos> im not suicidal just idling insignificantly <eos> i come up here for perception and clarity <eos> i like to imagine im playing sim city <eos> all the people look like ants from up here <eos> and the winds the only traffic you can hear" <eos> he said "all i ever wanted to be was an <eos> elevator operator can you help me please" <eos> "dont jump little boy dont jump off that roof <eos> youve got your whole life ahead of you <eos> youre still in your youth <eos> id give anything to have skin like you" you said we should look out further <eos> i guess it wouldnt hurt us <eos> we dont have to be around all these coffee shops <eos> now weve got that percolator <eos> never made a latte greater <eos> im saving dollars a week <eos> we drive to a house in preston <eos> we see police arresting <eos> a man with his hand in a bag <eos> hows that for first impressions <eos> this place seems depressing <eos> its a californian bungalow in a culdesac <eos> its got a lovely garden <eos> a garage for two cars to park in <eos> or a lot of room for storage if youve just got one <eos> and its going pretty cheap you say <eos> well its a deceased estate <eos> arent the pressed metal ceilings great <eos> then i see the handrail in the shower <eos> a collection of those canisters for coffee tea and flour <eos> and a photo of a young man in a van in vietnam <eos> and i cant think of floorboards anymore <eos> whether the front room faces south or north <eos> and i wonder what she bought it for <eos> if youve got a <eos> spare half a million <eos> you could knock it down <eos> and start rebuilding <eos> if youve got a <eos> spare half a million <eos> you could knock it down <eos> and start rebuilding <eos> if

seawater <eos> washed in by the waves at night leaving a salty snaillike trail behind <eos> this is no longer my house <eos> it has been claimed by the sea <eos> claimed by the sea <eos> and it was always going to be <eos> claimed by the sea <eos> ive planted a garden in assorted pots <eos> the flowers are drooping and waterlogged <eos> seaweed lay in wreaths like it was christmas time <eos> a

gone gone <eos> like the leaves on the old oak tree <eos> on the old oak tree <eos> light a candle keep it burning brightly <eos> shine it out across the sea <eos> so we wont be two ships passing in the night <eos> silently and let me tell you all my secrets <eos> when everything is gone gone gone <eos> like the leaves on the old oak tree <eos> on the old oak tree <eos> build a house call it a home <eos> stoke the fire to keep us warm <eos> engrave the words in an old oak tree <eos> my heart is your heart <eos> my heart is your heart <eos> when everything is gone gone gone <eos> like the leaves on the old oak tree <eos> on the old oak tree me and my friend dan <eos> are going to get some beers <eos> and then were going to go down <eos> to the park and drink them there <eos> well busk out in the sun <eos> play guitar and sing some songs <eos> pull up our friends and <eos> invite them down to share <eos> what might be <eos> the last weekend of the summer <eos> cause september getting colder as it goes <eos> and we havent done enough <eos> of this simple kind of stuff <eos> this year were clearly getting older <eos> and it shows <eos> well work weeks make us weary <eos> schools a distant memory <eos> and its easy to ask questions <eos> of ourselves <eos> like where it is were going <eos> and what we had to show <eos> from the sunny days weve <eos> in the shelves <eos> with expectations of our ultimate direction <eos> all the stations <eos> that we should have reached by now <eos> where we havent read the script <eos> and our tender wings are clipped <eos> and were scared we might be <eos> letting someone down <eos> listen to these heartbreak songs <eos> when nothings really wrong <eos> and then we smile <eos> when were asked <eos> and say were fine <eos> were drifting through <eos> our middle days <eos> and creeping <eos> into middle age <eos> and setting in our ways <eos> and now its time <eos> to decide <eos> now its time <eos> to draw the line <eos> in the sand <eos> and ask <eos> whats more important than <eos> days like today <eos> so grab some beers <eos> call your friends <eos> and meet us here <eos> in the summer park <eos> with me and my friend dan theyre coming out of the walls <eos> theyre coming up through the streets <eos> theyre quicksilver wracked by some invisible beat <eos> right outside of your door the very stones come alive <eos> they are the spring in the step the distant look in the eyes <eos> put your baudelaire away and come outside and play <eos> me and all my friends are poets of the deed <eos> were exactly what this country needs <eos> we scratch until were drunk we drink until we bleed <eos> we are what we believe <eos> pentameter in attack iambic pulse in the veins <eos> free verse powered of the street light mains <eos> an iliad played out without a shadow of doubt <eos> between the end of the club and the sun coming out <eos> leave kerouac at his desk we have romance in our risks <eos> and heres what we believe <eos> before we get bored lets be inspired <eos> lets ignore the applause and set the theater on fire <eos> fight every war like the drunks in the choir <eos> put our art where our mouths are poetry of the deed <eos> so enough with words and technical theses <eos> lets grab life by the throat and live it to pieces <eos> we can choose we can change <eos> and if we dont were just afraid of living life <eos> like were loved and in love and alive <eos> to all the things we could be if we just believed <eos> that life is too short to be lived without poetry <eos> if youve got soul darling now come on and show it me <eos> but life is too long to just sing the one song <eos> so well burn like a beacon and then well be gone so now the years are rolling by <eos> and its not long since you and i could have been <eos> train drivers and astronauts <eos> and now were stuck in furnished ruts <eos> but yet the thing that really cuts <eos> is that we cant remember how we got caught <eos> filtered air computer screens <eos> muffled sighs and mighthavebeens <eos> count your blessings then breathe <eos> and count to ten <eos> and though it doesnt often show <eos> we are scared because we know <eos> our forefathers were farmers and fishermen <eos> and so the world has changed <eos> worse or betters hard to tell <eos> but my hope remains within the arms of isabel <eos> so now our calloused hands once told <eos> a story honest as its old of sowing seeds <eos> and setting sail <eos> but now our hands are soft and weak <eos> and working seven days a week <eos> at these salvation schemes that are bound to fail <eos> and so the world has changed <eos> worse or betters hard to tell <eos> but my hope remains within the arms of isabel <eos> and ill admit that i am scared <eos> of what i dont understand <eos> but darling if youre there <eos> gentle voice and soothing hands <eos> to quiet my despair <eos> to shore up all my plans <eos> darling if youre there <eos> and so the world has changed <eos> and i must change as well <eos> the machines weve made will damn us into hell <eos> and the time will come when all must save themselves <eos> i will save my soul in the arms of isabel tonight is her night and the city holds its breath <eos> caught twixt life and death <eos> as she rolls in from the suburbs <eos> the garrison flees and the city will burn <eos> corinna rides like boadicea tonight <eos> london town trembles at the sight <eos> because tonight is her night <eos> and the youth course through the streets <eos> to lay down at her feet and she runs a regal eye <eos> to choose who lives and decide who dies <eos> corinna rides like boadicea tonight <eos> fearful crowds part ways without a fight <eos> corinna rides like boadicea tonight <eos> london town trembles at the sight <eos> because tonight is her night <eos> she keeps her counsel <eos> smiles when she speaks now from ear to ear <eos> shes getting married or so they tell me <eos> when the spring is here <eos> she hums a tune from a song <eos> she knows from warm summers past <eos> a song that was sung by <eos> kids around campfires in the quiet southwest <eos> corinna rides like boadicea tonight <eos> london town trembles at the sight <eos> because tonight is her night <eos> yeah tonight is her night <eos> yeah tonight is her night tonight is her night to the east to the east

running out <eos> ever since my childhood ive been scared ive been afraid <eos> of being trapped by circumstance and staying in one place <eos> so i always keep a small bag full of clothes carefully stored <eos> somewhere secret somewhere safe <eos> and somewhere close to the door <eos> well ive traveled many countries ive washed my feet in many seas <eos> ive drunk with drifters in vienna and with punks in old dc <eos> and ive driven across deserts driven by the irony <eos> that only being shackled to the the road could ever i be free <eos> to the east to the east <eos> the road beneath my feet <eos> to the west to the west <eos> i havent got there yet <eos> and to the north to the north <eos> never to be caught <eos> to the south to the south <eos> my time is running out <eos> ive felt old before my time but now i keep the age away <eos> by burning up the miles and yeah by filling up my days <eos> and the nights a thousand nights ive played <eos> and a thousand more to go <eos> before i take a breath and steal myself <eos> for the next one thousand shows <eos> to the east to the east <eos> the road beneath my feet <eos> to the west to the west <eos> i havent got there yet

the edges of the city <eos> meet me where the underground runs out <eos> bring a picnic blanket and your pity <eos> a pen and paper so i can write things down <eos> mother oh dear mother i wasnt joking when i said <eos> that i plan to keep doing this until the day im dead <eos> and im not a mirror for you when you were young <eos> but i still remain your faithful only son <eos> lately ive been feeling kind of fragile <eos> lately ive been feeling all worn out <eos> what would any of us do before the dreams that we had came to <eos> what would there be left to dream about <eos> father oh dear father im not trying to reject <eos> the values that you held like winning cards up to your chest <eos> but i cant just do the things that you wish that youd done <eos> though i still remain your faithful only son <eos> the city seems so still <eos> when youre looking down from highgate hill <eos> theres nothing left for us to say <eos> you taught me everything that i know <eos> you wouldnt miss me if i stayed <eos> you never see me if i go <eos> this is no confession no this is who i am <eos> make me in your image so you have to understand <eos> that i did my best as told and sove become <eos> youre loving and youre faithful only son richard divine made up his mind <eos> to take the last few steps to the bathroom door <eos> from his bedroom floor and to lock himself in <eos> steady young hands meticulous plans <eos> disposable razors and a blisterpack filled <eos> with strong sleeping pills and a bath of hot water <eos> he carefully wrote a funerary note <eos> on his best writing paper to set out the facts <eos> and sealed it with wax and left it in the kitchen <eos> he left it out so his parents would know <eos> what there was waiting for them <eos> pale cold skin and blood seeping in to the landing carpet <eos> he said hes not for sale said that he felt hounded <eos> crowded and surrounded by this life he didnt choose <eos> but everybody plays this game on a daily basis <eos> theyre not heroes theyre survivors <eos> and its not shakespearean if they lose <eos> so do what you want <eos> do what the voices tell you <eos> but dont ever say that we didnt warn you <eos> he said hes not for sale <eos> but he bought into his failure <eos> hes telling tales that hammer nails right into open palms <eos> a martyr in reverse <eos> hes best at being worst <eos> the rest of us are cursed <eos> but we keep calm and we carry on <eos> so richard here it is <eos> none of us are blameless <eos> huddled here like strangers <eos> shameless in our lists of all the changes we say we need <eos> but i think that you knew that <eos> you cant pretend its news <eos> that when you cut yourself youll bleed sunday nights are slow surrender <eos> it never lasts and we never learn <eos> we can still make this one to remember <eos> its sunday night and weve time to burn <eos> tomorrow morning can wait its turn <eos> so charge your glasses <eos> and raise a toast to the memory gained <eos> to the sleep that we lost <eos> another weekend run to ground <eos> another passing coat of red painted across our town <eos> work is shallow cuts are deep <eos> but who would waste two days respite <eos> you cant catch up on sleep <eos> so here we are last chance saloon <eos> the ticking clock and a slow defeat <eos> itll all be over soon <eos> once more friends unto the breach blearyeyed <eos> the stuff of dreams always slips out of reach <eos> defiance dressed in crumpled clothes <eos> protest played out with a headache <eos> starting late and going slow <eos> so though we know we have to be here <eos> we have tasted freer air so we dont have to care <eos> all our days will fade away <eos> in hazy nights and clear mistakes <eos> so heres to us and needs that must <eos> lets raise a toast for one last boast <eos> because its sunday night and weve time to burn <eos> tomorrow morning can wait its turn i should have seen you were coming <eos> i should have been prepare <eos> after all getting half of what you wish for isnt so rare <eos> but still i wasnt ready <eos> you took me by surprise <eos> you brought a light to my dark like a word from the wise <eos> weather wears the mountains right down into the sea <eos> so i will stand in the rain until i am clean <eos> we fell in love in the summer <eos> when the skies were clear <eos> but im still wearing my coat from winter last year <eos> i need to set my house in order <eos> confess and cover my sins <eos> i need to make a home for you before inviting you in <eos> weather wears the mountains right down into the sea <eos> so i will stand in the rain until i am clean <eos> rivers carve the country <eos> a landscape shaped by a stream <eos> so i will swim in the river for as long as you need <eos> i said darling oh my darling <eos> you know that everything that i do <eos> is to try and make me good enough for you <eos> darling oh my darling you know that everywhere that i go <eos> im just trying to find the fastest way back home <eos> darling oh my darling <eos> you know that everywhere that i go <eos> im just trying to find the fastest way back home lets inherit the earth <eos> cause no one else is taking it <eos> come on do your worst before the moments passed <eos> in bedrooms across england and all the western world <eos> theres posters and theres magazines <eos> cause music isnt ours <eos> cause we write love songs in c and we do politics in g <eos> we sing songs about our friends in e minor <eos> so tear down the stars now and take up your guitars <eos> and come on folks and try this at home <eos> lets stop waiting around for someone to patronize us <eos> lets hammer out a sound that speaks of where weve been <eos> forget about the haircuts and stupid skinny jeans <eos> the stampings and the irony of the media philistines <eos> cause we write love songs in c and we do politics in g <eos> we sing songs about our friends in e minor <eos> so tear down the stars now and take up your guitars <eos> and come on folks and try this at home <eos> because the only thing <eos> that punkrock should never really mean <eos> is not sitting round <eos> and waiting for the lights to turn green <eos> and not thinking that youre better <eos> cause youre stood up on a stage <eos> if youre oh so fucking different <eos> then who cares what you have to say <eos> cause theres no such thing as rockstars <eos> theres just people who play music <eos> and some of them are just like us <eos> and some of them are dicks <eos> so quick turn off your stereo <eos> pick up that pen and paper <eos> yeah you can do much better <eos> than some skinny halfarsed english country singer <eos> cause we write love songs in c and we do politics in g <eos> we sing songs about our friends in e minor <eos> so tear down the stars now and take up your guitars <eos> and come on folks and try this at home i bought my soul back from the devil <eos> and now im keeping it all to myself <eos> im checking myself out of the program <eos> because i know whats best for my health <eos> so why live the dream like youre running out of sleep <eos> im not playing to pass time <eos> im playing for keeps <eos> we only just started and youre throwing the fight <eos> youd rather burn out than fade away <eos> well why not both i plan to stay <eos> so lets do this once and lets do it right <eos> i used to act like none of this mattered <eos> i used to say that i didnt care <eos> that we wouldnt be doing this forever <eos> but the truth is that i was just scared <eos> so you put up a front to protect yourself <eos> but if were down on the floor <eos> why get back on the shelf <eos> you cant change your outfit now the night has begun <eos> but weve still got the fuel <eos> we still have the fire so me and you jay <eos> lets never retire <eos> lets keep on making mistakes till were done <eos> im going to live fast and im going to die old <eos> im going to end my days in a house with high windows <eos> on the quiet shores in the southwest <eos> so you sort the tunes and ill bring the beers <eos> and on my seventieth birthday ill see you right here <eos> and together well watch the sun set <eos> theres no one in my coffin <eos> theres nothing in my grave <eos> im tired of being damned <eos> id rather be saved <eos> and we can never sell out <eos> because we never bought in <eos> and if they build it back up <eos> then well swing back through town <eos> and burn the whole thing down again <eos> it wont last so be bold <eos> choose your path show soul <eos> live fast and die old once an honest man could go from sunrise to its set <eos> without encountering agents of his state or government <eos> but a sorry cloud of tyranny has fallen across the land <eos> brought on by hollow men who did not understand <eos> that for centuries our forefather have fought and often died <eos> to keep themselves unto themselves to fight the rising tide <eos> and that if in the smallest battles we surrender to the state <eos> we enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape <eos> when they raise their hands up our lives to possess <eos> to know our souls to drag us down well resist <eos> watt tyler led the people in <eos> to meet the king at smithfield and issue this demand <eos> that winchesters should be the only law across the land <eos> the law of old king alfreds time of free and honest men <eos> because the people then they understood what we have since forgot <eos> that a government will only work for its own benefit <eos> and id rather stand up naked against the elements alone <eos> than give the hollow men the right to enter in my home <eos> when they raise their hands up our lives to possess <eos> to know our souls to drag us down well resist <eos> stand up sons of liberty and fight for what you own <eos> stand up sons of liberty and fight fight for for your homes <eos> so if ever a man should ask you for your business or your name <eos> tell him to go and fuck himself tell his friends to do the same <eos> because a man whod trade his liberty for a safe and dreamless sleep <eos> doesnt deserve the both of them and neither shall he keep moses was old a chill in his bones <eos> falling apart he knew in his heart that his time had come <eos> as he lay in his tent in the hot desert sands <eos> he smiled at how he would never see his promised land <eos> he sang <eos> "i could have lived and died an egyptian prince <eos> i could have played safe <eos> but in the end the journeys <eos> brought joys that outweigh the pain" <eos> odysseus sat tired and alone <eos> hed always held out against <eos> all the doubts that he would come home <eos> but now he was here <eos> his soul felt estranged <eos> his wife and his dog <eos> his son and his gods everything changed <eos> he sang <eos> "i could have stayed and ruled as an ithican prince <eos> i couldve played safe <eos> but in the end the journeys brought <eos> joys that outweigh the pain" <eos> balthazar rode for seven long years <eos> eastwards and far <eos> he followed his star <eos> and it brought him here <eos> to a stable in ruins <eos> in some backwater town <eos> to a virgin defiled <eos> no king but a child <eos> too small for a crown <eos> he sang <eos> "i could have lived with my gods as a persian prince <eos> i couldve played safe <eos> but in the end the journeys brought <eos> joys that outweigh the pain" <eos> paupers and kings princes and thieves <eos> singers of songs righters of wrongs be what you believe <eos> so saddle your horse and shoulder your load <eos> burst at the seams be what you dream and take to the road a free house a soundsystem and a fridge full of beer <eos> ive known how this story ends for a good few years <eos> the night lays out before my eyes theres no new faces no surprises <eos> this town is growing old with me so im making a move <eos> everybody round heres been out with everybody else <eos> which makes talking to girls hazardous to my health <eos> theyve been in this genepool so long theyve got wrinkled toes <eos> i dont want all her exes to be people i know <eos> theres millions more fish in the sea so im making a move <eos> im bored of this town bored of this scene bored of these people yeah <eos> im an expert at pretending that everything is ok <eos> but im just a kid and it seems as if ive signed my life away <eos> i need to get out and see what the rest of the world is about <eos> this toen aint big enough for the one of me im making a move <eos> every guy with long hair round here is a star <eos> accorinding to his girlfriend and the way that he holds his guitar <eos> if anyone gets out they stick in the knife i dont want to get stuck here for the rest of my life <eos> im sick of these fuckers im moving on <eos> i still want to be buried here just like i said but id prefer it if youd wait until im actually dead <eos> its easy to get caught inside a town that seems to have a hivemind <eos> but im packing up and moving on <eos> when i move out from my parents house im gone yeah fuck you guys im gone <eos> this town aint big enough for the one of me <eos> so why dont you get from in front of me <eos> were all going to move to london anyway so ill see you in town i have to admit that i am one of the many <eos> who thought that a guitar would win him a lady <eos> my teenage years they were a feminine drought <eos> and i thought that a serenade would help out <eos> and it seemed to be working for a couple of years <eos> i wrote a few songs and they wrought a few tears <eos> but when i hit my twenties it ran out of steam <eos> i seemed to be suffering from romantic fatigue <eos> and i never know which song i should play her <eos> each melody is a memory of a not forgotten failure <eos> so when i get out my guitar tonight to do what i do <eos> remember i probably didnt write this song for you <eos> so as i have mentioned the shelf life was short <eos> the scheme wasnt working despite what i thought <eos> the ladies all left me alone in the end <eos> so i had to switch all the names around and then sing it again <eos> and every life long love and every best friend <eos> slipped away into the past <eos> take my words with caution i cant pretend <eos> that youre the first you wont be the last <eos> i never know which song i should play her <eos> each melody is a memory of a not forgotten failure <eos> so when i get out my guitar tonight to do what i do <eos> remember i probably didnt write this song <eos> no i certainly didnt write this song <eos> no i never never wrote a song for you ive been trying to find a way that i could say it you <eos> say it you all that ive been trying to say <eos> ive been stuttering my way from here to anywhere <eos> anywhere you can hear me stutter away <eos> ive been longing for the day when you would say "hey <eos> i feel a little fragile today and i was wondering if i could drop on by" <eos> ive been talking to total strangers in the middle of the night <eos> because i get so nervous when i dial your number <eos> that i never quite punch it in right in spite of me <eos> so i havent been as strong as i had thought id be <eos> but i think ive been stronger than you would concede <eos> so lets do that exercise where you close your eyes <eos> and fall back onto me and you will see im strong after all <eos> i will lift you up if youll lay me down <eos> so today could be the day when we both say "hey <eos> i feel a little fragile today and i was wondering if i could drop on by" <eos> so i wont be nervous when i dial your number in the middle of the night <eos> i will clear my throat then ill sing this song <eos> and ill be out the door and round before the first of the new days light whatever happened to childhood <eos> were all scared of the kids in our neighboorhood <eos> theyre not small charming and harmless <eos> theyre a violent bunch of bastard little shits <eos> and anyone who looks younger than me <eos> makes me check for my wallet my phone and my keys <eos> and im tired of being tired out <eos> always being on the lookout for thieving gits <eos> were all wondering how we ended up so scared <eos> we spent ten long years teaching our kids not to care <eos> and that "theres no such thing as society" anyway <eos> and all the rich folks act surprised <eos> when all sense of community dies <eos> but you just closed your eyes to the other sidev of all the things that she did <eos> thatcher fucked the kids <eos> and it seems a little bit rich to me <eos> the way the rich only ever talk of charity <eos> in times like the seventies the broken down economy <eos> meant even the upper tier was needing some help <eos> but as soon as things look brighter <eos> yeah the grin gets wider and the grip gets tighter <eos> and for every teenage tracksuit mugger <eos> theres a guy in a suit who wouldnt lift a finger for anybody else <eos> youve got a generation raised on the welfare state <eos> enjoyed all its benefits and did just great <eos> but as soon as they were settled as the richest of the rich <eos> they kicked away the ladder told the rest of us that lifes a bitch <eos> and its no surprise that all the fuckups <eos> didnt show up until the kids had grown up <eos> but when no one ever smiles or ever helps a stranger <eos> is it any fucking wonder our societys in danger of collapse we were only supposed to go out for the night <eos> but its been a few hours now since it got light <eos> were a mess and the worst part is we couldnt care less <eos> theres water in the ashtray and ash in the sink <eos> the carpets mostly soaking but theres nothing to drink <eos> were a state and were starting to regret staying awake <eos> and ill pay for my sins when i get paid <eos> ill stop talking to girls when i get laid <eos> i should have gone home when i could but i stayed <eos> but then i never was the clever one <eos> we were only supposed to go out for the night <eos> i did my best to go home but in the end i lost the fight with myself <eos> to be honest i was hoping id go home with someone else <eos> and right about now i should be starting my day <eos> but instead i am sat here downing the dregs of yesterday <eos> all the while trying to prop up both ends of my smile <eos> and ill pay for my sins when i get paid <eos> ill stop talking to girls when i get laid <eos> i should have gone home when i could but i stayed <eos> but then i never was the clever one <eos> but always the one to not see that im done and <eos> i need to go home and get to sleep <eos> always the last to see the moment has passed and <eos> i need to admit my defeat <eos> and im lonely there i said it <eos> im lonely but its hard to admit it <eos> when everbody thinks that youre fine all the time and youre not <eos> so we were only supposed to go out for the night <eos> but who am i kidding try as i might i cant stop <eos> until ive squeezed out every last drop <eos> and ill pay for my sins when i get paid <eos> but i dont have a penny to my name <eos> ill stop talking to girls when i get laid <eos> but i havent had a shower for days <eos> i shouldve gone home when i could but i stayed <eos> and so i stay up alone <eos> and set off on my own <eos> to the station where i catch the first train i remember the day the day <eos> when i had to take you to the airport <eos> and put you on a plane <eos> and so you left me <eos> left me alone on an empty tube train <eos> deep under the ground <eos> while you were bathed in sunlight <eos> high above the clouds <eos> i needed you here <eos> to be my sunshine in london town <eos> californias had more than its fair share <eos> you left me to these small skies <eos> and to rainsoaked concrete <eos> to morrissey and robert smith <eos> and complicated streets i know <eos> on which you lost your patience and your way <eos> the way you always did on steel gray rainy days <eos> i needed you here <eos> to be my sunshine in london town <eos> californias had more than its fair share <eos> of beating summer sun and shining seas <eos> but it doesnt have a shred of honesty <eos> i know the truth yeah neil young <eos> and joni mitchell were canadians <eos> i guess that makes sense they had their fill <eos> and then they moved away again <eos> youre not alone we all sometimes <eos> use words that we dont understand <eos> your love was only just skin deep <eos> and in the end it gave me cancer <eos> you might have been my sunshine <eos> but id rather have a rainy day <eos> california gets just what it deserves i check that ive got all my things before i leave the house <eos> because when im gone im never coming back <eos> im not being melodramatic its just i neither have your number or a key <eos> an evening spent pretending that were just becoming friends <eos> or this goes any further than going back <eos> im not being pessimistic its just you and i were never meant to be <eos> it isnt love but every time i kind of wish it was <eos> ive picked up this silly habit in the last few years of going out <eos> in the evening with my friends into the town <eos> of packing a spare tshirt in my bag in case i do not make it home <eos> its pathetic and i know it but the truth is thereve been mornings <eos> ive proved prudent taking toothpaste to the pub <eos> but thats precious little comfort against the knowledge of the person ive become <eos> it isnt love but every time i kind of wish it was <eos> and i can see that in your eyes you wish it was <eos> but every time i leave you just because <eos> it isnt love its been eighteen months since i kissed you once <eos> so just saying hi just isnt going to fly <eos> but if you give me a clue and a minute or two <eos> then i might remember your name <eos> and i hate to insist that i was really that pissed <eos> but to tell the truth in my flush of youth <eos> i would drown my sight until faces <eos> and nights seemed the same <eos> and a nervous shrug and an awkward hug <eos> wont get me out of the hole that ive dug <eos> so i slip the noose with a poor excuse <eos> and talk to someone anyone else <eos> and i sit with my friends and i try to pretend <eos> that i never did that sort of thing again <eos> but im lying to myself <eos> and suddenly its as clear as clear could be <eos> im not quite the perfect man that i hoped id be <eos> and though i always tried to live an honest life <eos> to tell my truth ive told my share of lies <eos> i remember you of course i do <eos> but i dont recall how many times weve been through <eos> this little game that always ends the same <eos> with you sad and me far away and every time i repeat the line <eos> that the faults not mine and i wasnt unkind <eos> but the worst part is that ive got nothing else to say <eos> and all the pretty little pictures of faith <eos> and firm devotion that i painted as a child <eos> well they have fallen by the wayside <eos> along with all my puppy fat <eos> but my days have taught me this <eos> that every day i spend pretending <eos> that i always choose the right path <eos> is a day that i choose the wrong <eos> oh yes my wisdom teeth have been giving me grief <eos> they woke me up to find that im exactly the kind of <eos> guy i said that id rather be dead than be <eos> in the days before i got laid blacking in and out in a strange flat in east london <eos> somebody i dont really know just gave me something to help <eos> set me down and stop me always thinking about you <eos> and you know your life is heading in a questionable <eos> direction when youre off in days with strangers <eos> and you cant remember anything except way you sound <eos> when you told me you didnt know what i should do <eos> its a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way back to the light <eos> a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way to make it right <eos> and so i wake up in the morning just like every other day <eos> and just like every boring blues song i get swallowed by the pain <eos> and so i fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away <eos> but youre not lying there any longer and i know <eos> that its my fault so i been pounding on the floor <eos> and ive been crawling up the walls and ive been divvying my darkness <eos> and serotonin boosters cider and some kind of smelling salts <eos> its a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way back to the light <eos> a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way to make it right <eos> so on the first night we met you said well darling lets make a deal <eos> if anybody ever asks us well lets say that we met in jail <eos> and thats the story that im sticking to like <eos> a southern face that comforts but today i need to hear <eos> some truth if im ever getting through this <eos> yea you once sent me a letter that said if i was lost at sea <eos> close my eyes and catch a time idea and only think of me <eos> well darling now im sinking im as lost as <eos> lost can be and im hoping you can drag me <eos> off and down and out to my recovery <eos> if you could just give me a sign and just a subtle little glimmer <eos> a suggestion that youd have me if i could only make me better <eos> then id stand a little stronger as i walk a little taller all the time <eos> cause i know that you are cynical but i think <eos> i can convince you yea cause broken people <eos> can get better if they really want to <eos> or at least thats what i have to tell myself if im hoping to survive <eos> its a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way back to the light <eos> a long road out to recovery from here <eos> a long way back to whats right <eos> darling sweet lover wont you help me to recover <eos> darling sweet lover wont you help me to recover <eos> darling sweet lover wont you help me to recover <eos> darling sweet lover one day this will all be over just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather <eos> and i can fuck up anything anything <eos> it was a wonderful life when we were together <eos> and now ive fucked up every little goddamn thing <eos> amelie lied to me this was supposed to be easy <eos> i found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night <eos> but sleeping gets tiring and dark reminds me of dying <eos> and as long as this feeble heart is still beating <eos> you will find me rushing through every room switching on all the lights <eos> the problem with falling in love in latenight bars <eos> is that theres always more nights theres always more bars <eos> the problem with showing your lover your scars <eos> is that everybodys lover is covered in scars <eos> so give me one fine day of plain sailing weather <eos> and i can fuck up anything anything <eos> it was a wonderful life when we were together <eos> and now ive fucked up <eos> everythings gone fractious and i felt faithless <eos> at that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart <eos> but baby i didnt mean it for things to get desperate <eos> i let slip my guard i let go of the rudder <eos> now were drifting in the current away from one another <eos> so give me one fine day of plain sailing weather <eos> and i can fuck up anything anything <eos> it was a wonderful life when we were together <eos> and now ive fucked up everything <eos> so give me one fine day of plain sailing weather <eos> and i can fuck up anything anything <eos> it was a wonderful life when we were together <eos> and now ive fucked up every little goddamn thing <eos> every little goddamn thing every little goddamn thing <eos> every little goddamn thing <eos> ive been skirting round the rim of doing something <eos> brave and not just standing but jumping in <eos> of making circles into squares of laying down <eos> the bare facts like a burden i cant bear <eos> and i can almost find the words but i can see the way youd <eos> fold your hands speak my name like a curse <eos> upon your pretty lips the pressured white behind your fingertips <eos> and when you see me for all that i am <eos> i couldnt make mistakes to make a difference any more <eos> id throw myself down on my knees at your hands <eos> and beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults <eos> and maybe youd relent and return my hope for our forever <eos> lift up your precious hands and then bring yours and mine together <eos> so just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather <eos> just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather when i was sixteen i cut myself a mohawk <eos> because i wanted to walk the walk <eos> and not just talk the talk <eos> but it was a bit of a disaster because <eos> i did the sides with kitchen scissors <eos> because i didnt have any clippers <eos> and i didnt want to use a beardtrimmer <eos> id made that mistake before <eos> when you got home you didnt want to talk about what id done <eos> you said id let you down id fucked around when i was only having fun <eos> with the way that youve been lately youve no right to scream and shout <eos> you and i weve got a lot that we need to talk about <eos> whats the point in making vows that youre never going to keep <eos> a lifetime lying awake means youll never get to sleep <eos> and all the promises you made that were painful and untrue <eos> of all the things you do they reflect worst on you <eos> we all have our own devices <eos> for handling midlife crises <eos> usually involves a motorbike and <eos> suspicious fashion decisions <eos> but you choose to stave off grey hairs by <eos> lamely hacking at the sides <eos> with lies and flimsy alibis <eos> for your suspicious expeditions <eos> when i get home i dont want to talk about what youve done <eos> yes youve let me down youve fucked around but i guess you were having fun <eos> with the way that ive been lately ive no right to scream and shout <eos> you and i weve got a lot that we need to talk about <eos> you always told me fathers day was just another way <eos> of selling hallmark greeting cards <eos> twenty years of waking sleep of lying through your teeth <eos> meant every fathers day spent wondering who the hell you are <eos> whats the point in us making vows that were never going to keep <eos> i keep trying to keep you up but you keep on falling asleep <eos> and all the promises we made were painful and untrue <eos> but for better or for worse i am turning into you you and i could have a rock n roll romance <eos> we could fuck in our clothes <eos> we could sleep in our pants <eos> i will crash at yours and you will crash at mine <eos> and we would stay in bed of the given time <eos> leave this loveless lonely behind <eos> cause youve been searching up and down and all around <eos> and theres no nice boys in london town <eos> i can sympathize cause ive been searching too <eos> yet to find a girl half as good as you <eos> youre just not paying attention <eos> youre sitting in your kitchen and youre bitching about rejection <eos> were cheating the world out of a fairytale love and conclusion <eos> and thats not really fair on us all lets begin at the beginning <eos> were lovers and were losers <eos> were heroes and were pioneers <eos> and were beggars and were choosers <eos> were skirting round the edges <eos> of the ideal demographic <eos> were almost on the guestlist <eos> but were always stuck in traffic <eos> weve watched our close associates <eos> up and play their parts <eos> theyre chatting up the it girls <eos> and theyre tearing up the charts <eos> while we were paying with coppers <eos> to get our round in at the bar <eos> were the seeteam were the almost famous <eos> old friends of the stars <eos> justin is the last <eos> of the great romantic poets <eos> and hes the only one among us <eos> who is ever going to make it <eos> we planned a revolution <eos> from a cheap southampton bistro <eos> i dont remember details <eos> but there were english boys with banjos <eos> jay is our st george and hes standing on a wooden chair <eos> and he sings songs and he slays dragons and hes losing all his hair <eos> adam is the resurrected spirit of gram parsons in plaid instead of rhinestone and living in south london <eos> and no ones really clear about tommys job description <eos> but its pretty clear hes vital to the whole damn operation <eos> dave danger smiles at strangers tres the safest girl i know <eos> zo and harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home <eos> we wont change our ways we will proud remain when the glory fades <eos> i am sick and tired of people <eos> who are living on the belist <eos> theyre waiting to be famous <eos> and theyre wondering why they do this <eos> and i know im not the one who is habitually optimistic <eos> but im the one whos got the microphone here so just remember this <eos> life is about love last minutes and lost evenings <eos> about fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings <eos> and the aching amplitudes that set our needles all aflickering <eos> and help us with remembering that the only thing thats left to do is live <eos> after all the loving and the losing <eos> for the heroes and the pioneers <eos> the only thing thats left to do <eos> is get another round in at the bar from the heart of the southern downs to the northeast london reservoirs <eos> from the start the land scaped my sound before id ever been to america <eos> and if i knew anybody who played pedal steel guitar <eos> id get them in my band and then my band would get real far <eos> but i was raised in middle england and not in nashville tennessee <eos> and the only person in my band is me <eos> a simple scale on an old guitar and a punk rock sense of honesty <eos> i cannot fail ive got this far with no knowledge of midwest geography <eos> and if i knew anywhere where i could drive in a straight line <eos> for hours in the desert id drive for hours at a time <eos> but i was raised in middle england not in nashville tennessee <eos> and the only person in this car is me <eos> and yes im in fourfour time and yes i use cheap cheap rhymes <eos> but i try to make a sound my own <eos> i know i dont break new ground many have travelled this sound <eos> but i try to make it sound like home <eos> well ive been to texas state i didnt think it was that fucking great <eos> and nebraska is just a bunch of songs <eos> holloway and hampshire where i belong <eos> and i dont know anybody who plays pedal steel guitar <eos> all the city roads are twisted and i do not own a car <eos> i was raised in middle england not in nashville tennessee <eos> and the only thing im offering is me i woke up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house surrounded by sleeping folks i didnt know <eos> on failing to find my friends i decided it was clearly time to go <eos> so i made my way out of the door as quietly as i could there was no one there i knew to say goodbye <eos> squinting in the sadly sobering sunshine of the sunday morning light <eos> i started the night with all my friends and i ended up alone <eos> i started out so happy now im hungover and down <eos> it was about then that i realized i was halfway through the best years of my life <eos> i scanned the local landmarks trying to find out where i was and maybe even find a bus back home <eos> longing for a shower and for clean sheets and a charger for my phone <eos> suddenly it hit me i got paid this friday last and so i rifled through my pockets for some change <eos> but all i found was a packet of broken cigarettes and a sinking sense of shame <eos> i had to ask myself <eos> is is really worth it is any of this worth it <eos> well the whole things far from perfect <eos> but ive yet to figure out a better way to spend my time well i guess i should confess that i am starting to get old <eos> all the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold <eos> all the kids are talking slang i wont pretend to understand <eos> all my friends are getting married mortagages and pension plans <eos> and its obvious my angry adolescent days are done <eos> and im happy and im settled in the person ive become <eos> but that doesnt mean im settled up and sitting out the game <eos> time may change a lot but some things may stay the same <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i will not grow up <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i yeah i wont grow up <eos> oh maturitys a wrapped up package deal so it seems <eos> and ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams <eos> all your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will <eos> have to grow up be an adult yeah be bored and unfulfilled <eos> oh when no ones yet explained to me exactly whats so great <eos> about slaving years away on something that you hate <eos> look im meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity <eos> well if thats your road then take it but its not the road for me <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i will not grow up <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i yeah i wont grow up <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i will not grow up <eos> and if all you ever do with your life <eos> is photosynthesize <eos> then you deserve every hour of these sleepless nights <eos> that you waste wondering when youre gonna die <eos> now ill play and you sing <eos> the perfect way for the evening to begin <eos> now ill play and you sing <eos> the perfect way for the evening to begin <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all yeah i wont grow up <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i will not grow up <eos> and i wont sit down <eos> and i wont shut up <eos> and most of all i will not grow up i was sipping on a whiskey when i got the call <eos> yeah my friend lex was lying in the hospital <eos> shed been pretty sick for about half a year <eos> but it seems liked this time the end was drawing near <eos> so dropped my plans and jumped the next london train <eos> i found her laid up and in a lot of pain <eos> her eyes met mine and then i understood <eos> that her weather forecast wasnt looking too good <eos> so i sat and spun her stories for a little while <eos> tried to raise her mood and tried to raise a smile <eos> but she silenced all my rambling with a shake of her head <eos> drew me close and listen this is what she said now <eos> "youll live to dance another day <eos> its just now youll have to dance <eos> for the two of us so stop looking so damn depressed <eos> and sing with all your heart that the queen is dead" <eos> yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food <eos> and of doctors distant relatives draining her blood <eos> she said "i know im dying <eos> but im not finished just yet <eos> i am dying for a drink and for a cigarette" <eos> so we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel <eos> in the centre of the city and to raise some hell <eos> they waste to all the clubs <eos> and then when everyone else is long asleep <eos> we know were good and done <eos> "youll live to dance another day <eos> its just now youll have to dance <eos> for the two of us <eos> so stop looking so damn depressed <eos> and sing with all your heart that the queen is dead" <eos> and south londons not the same anymore <eos> the queen is dead <eos> and the last of the great has finally gone to bed <eos> well i was working on some words when sarah called me up <eos> she said that lex had gone asleep and wasnt waking up <eos> and even though i knew that there was nothing to be done <eos> i felt bad for not being there and now well she was gone <eos> so i tried to think what lex would want me to do <eos> at times like this when i was feeling blue <eos> so i gathered up some friends to spread the sad sad news <eos> and we headed to the city for a drink or two <eos> and we sang <eos> "we live to dance another day <eos> its just now we have to dance for one more of us <eos> so stop looking so damn depressed <eos> and sing with all our hearts long live the queen" when i was sixteen i cut myself a mohawk <eos> because i wanted to walk the walk <eos> and not just talk the talk <eos> but it was a bit of a disaster because <eos> i did the sides with kitchen scissors <eos> because i didnt have any clippers <eos> and i didnt want to use a beardtrimmer <eos> id made that mistake before <eos> when

<eos> i keep trying to keep you up but you keep on falling asleep <eos> and all the promises we made were painful and untrue <eos> but for better or for worse i am turning into you everybodys got themselves a plan <eos> everybody thinks theyll be <eos> the man including the girls <eos> the musicians who lack the friends to start a band <eos> the singer song writers <eos> the rest of us are djs or official club photographers <eos> and tonight im playing another nambooka show <eos> so im going through my phone book texting everyone i know <eos> and quite a few i dont whose numbers found their way onto my phone <eos> but i might come along anyway you never really know <eos> because none of this is going anywhere <eos> and pretty soon well all be old <eos> and no one left alive will really care <eos> about our glory days when we sold our souls <eos> but if your all about the destination <eos> then take a fucking flight <eos> where going nowhere slowly but seeing all the signs <eos> and were definitely going to hell youre not as messed up as you think you are <eos> your selfabsorption makes you messier <eos> just settle down and you will feel a whole lot better <eos> deep down youre just like everybody else <eos> shes not as pretty as she thinks she is <eos> just picture her after shes had kids <eos> i bet she sits at home and listens to the smiths <eos> deep down shes just like everybody else <eos> so why are you sat at home <eos> youre not designed to be alone <eos> you just got used to saying "no" <eos> so get up and get down and get outside <eos> cos its a lovely sunny day <eos> but you hide yourself away <eos> youve only got yourself to blame <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> hes not as clever as he likes to think <eos> hes just ambitious with his arguing <eos> hes crap at dancing yeah and he cant hold his drink <eos> deep down hes just like everybody else <eos> im not as awesome as this song makes out <eos> im angry underweight and sketching out <eos> im building bonfires on my vanities and doubts <eos> to get warm just like everybody else <eos> so why are you sat at home <eos> youre not designed to be alone <eos> you just got used to saying "no" <eos> so get up and get down and get outside <eos> cos its a lovely sunny day <eos> but you hide yourself away <eos> youve only got yourself to blame <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> amy thinks that life is lacking in drama <eos> so she fell for horoscopes faithhealing and karma <eos> shes so wrapped up in her invisible armor <eos> shell never grow into herself <eos> and its ok thinking me and all my friends are just wasters <eos> but saying that i can still see through her heirs and graces <eos> i bet shes scared her life wont leave any traces <eos> caught up like everyone else <eos> thats not the point anyway <eos> oh darling i felt compelled to call you up to say <eos> so why are you sat at home <eos> youre not designed to be alone <eos> you just got used to saying "no" <eos> so get up and get down and get outside <eos> cos its a lovely sunny day <eos> but you hide yourself away <eos> youve only got yourself to blame <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> get up and get down and get outside <eos> get up and get down and get outside the first girl that i fell for was a fair and faithful fighter <eos> she smoldered with a will to save the world <eos> i did my best to help her yeah i stood shoulder to shoulder <eos> on the front lines with my visionary girl <eos> i wish that she had cared for me <eos> but in the end her ideologies <eos> occupied the fortress of her heart <eos> i wrote her songs but still we had to part <eos> and if music was the food of love <eos> then id be a fat romantic slob <eos> well music its my substitute for love <eos> the last girl that i loved she was a low and lusty liar <eos> she set my heart on fire but made me choke <eos> her beauty was a sight to see but she didnt save it all for me <eos> i found other fires by following the smoke <eos> i wish that she had either cared for me or <eos> let me be <eos> but she chased me from mind and from my home <eos> i wrote her songs but i ended up alone <eos> and if love is really all that we need <eos> then even all my singing is never gonna save me <eos> music its my substitute for love <eos> well ive had many different girls inside my bed <eos> but only one or two inside my head <eos> these days i cuddle up to my guitar instead <eos> but oh what i would give not to stumble but to really fall in love <eos> and i could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me god dammit amy were not kids any more <eos> you cant just keep waltzing out of my life <eos> leaving clothes on my bedroom floor <eos> like nothing really matters like pain doesnt hurt <eos> you should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt <eos> you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that i made when i was a kid <eos> with a disassembled disposable razor i stole from my dad <eos> when i thought that suffering was something profound <eos> that weighed down on wise heads <eos> and not just something to be avoided <eos> something normal people dread <eos> god dammit amy well of course ive changed <eos> with all the things ive done and the places ive been <eos> id be a machine if i had stayed the same <eos> but youre still back where we started you havent changed at all <eos> youre still trying to live like a kid like you can always have it all <eos> you know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that i hid as best i could <eos> that i covered with ink but in the right kind of light they still bleed through <eos> showing that there are some things i just cant change no matter what i do <eos> the telltale signs of being used <eos> of being trapped inside of you <eos> youre a beautiful butterfly <eos> burned with a branding iron <eos> onto my outsides into my insides <eos> as a simple sign <eos> to show off your ownership <eos> burned into my naked skin <eos> onto my outsides into my insides <eos> its not even love any more <eos> its just a claim upon my soul <eos> it stains my skin yeah its on my breath <eos> and im ashamed to get undressed <eos> in front of strangers in case they see <eos> the tell tale signs that you have left all over me <eos> god dammit amy <eos> youll always remind me of scars on my arms that i know will never fade <eos> and its not like its something i think about each and every day <eos> i just occasionally catch myself scratching them as if theyd ever go away <eos> but these tell tale signs are here to stay and in the end you know thats ok <eos> you will always be a part of my patchedup patchwork tapedup tapedeck heart the next round the next round i drink cause im thirsty <eos> i drink cause im dry <eos> im not yet quite thirty <eos> but i feel like im dieing <eos> i drink cause i want to <eos> cause i need to <eos> cause i dont what else to <eos> do with my time <eos> i wont say it <eos> you can see it in my eyes <eos> you drink cause your lonely <eos> you drink cause your sad <eos> you always claim every party <eos> is the best time you ever had <eos> you drink cause your scared of life on <eos> living off your own company <eos> you wont say it <eos> but i can see it in your eyes <eos> all of the things i could become <eos> a lonely drunkard isnt one <eos> which i wouldve wished <eos> when i was young <eos> the drink has drunk my days away <eos> i tried to live like hemingway <eos> but life just doesnt work that way <eos> the pills dont kill the pain <eos> they just delay <eos> we drink cause were scared that <eos> if we should stop <eos> the good will go away <eos> that the bad times will not <eos> what if its over and were sober <eos> and we feel like were fixing to die <eos> what now dont say it <eos> cause i can see it in your eye <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me <eos> the next rounds on me i was walking home to my house through the snow from the station <eos> when springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question <eos> oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption <eos> or are we are merely biding our time down to the lonely conclusions <eos> darling let me take your hand as i talk you through this <eos> how loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis <eos> lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on takers <eos> with my feelings laid clear on the ceiling <eos> i dont think i can do this <eos> i dont think i can do this <eos> well i tried so hard to not turn into my father <eos> if i only ever skip out his choices will i ever choose better <eos> the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener <eos> so i left you alone in a restaurant in london in winter <eos> you deserved better <eos> out of trash some might back in my ears <eos> sound comes clear and brings the awful truth that i cant stand what ive done to you <eos> and its written clear in my diary today should have been our anniversary <eos> and im far way and im far apart <eos> and youre back home with a broken heart <eos> and loves is real and i cant escape <eos> ill only ever have myself to blame <eos> these failures shift and save me in the night <eos> like a fever i cant break try as i might <eos> wake me darling i need you to take me home <eos> but i know in the end redemption is mine and mine alone wandering lonely through the snow streets of new york <eos> i stumbled on a thrift store that sold postcards by the yard <eos> i bought a mile and shipped them home so i could read <eos> ten thousand tenword tragedies the lives these strangers lead <eos> to remind myself the things i need <eos> cause i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> you left me feeling like <eos> wed never really been in love <eos> huddled home up in my place in holloway <eos> i wondered if you ever heard those songs i used to play <eos> i wrote them as a gift for you and in return <eos> you gave a pair of hand knit mittens to keep my fingers warm <eos> so i could play more ignored love songs <eos> i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> and i once wrote you postcards <eos> you never wrote back <eos> promised me you would and im still waiting for them <eos> you left me feeling like <eos> wed never really been in love <eos> dont wanna fit like mittens <eos> i wanna fit like gloves <eos> wanna fit like gloves <eos> i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> never like gloves i was taking compass bearings for the ordnance survey <eos> on an army training camp in salisbury plain <eos> i had packed up my theodolite i was calling it a day <eos> when i heard a voice that sang a sad refrain <eos> oh my darling armadillo <eos> let me tell you of my love <eos> listen to my armadillo roundelay <eos> be my fellow on my pillow <eos> underneath this weeping willow <eos> be my darling armadillo all the day <eos> i was somewhat disconcerted by this curious affair <eos> for a single armadillo you will own on salisbury plain in summer is comparatively rare <eos> and a pair of them is practically unknown <eos> drawn by that mellow solo <eos> there i followed on my bike <eos> to discover what these armadillo lovers would be like <eos> oh my darling armadillo <eos> how delightful it would be <eos> if for us those silver wedding bells would chime <eos> let the orange blossoms billow <eos> you need only say i will oh <eos> be my darling armadillo all the time <eos> then i saw them in a hollow by a yellow muddy bank <eos> an armadillo singing to an armourplated tank <eos> should i tell him gaunt and rusting with the willow tree above <eos> this abandoned on manoeuvres is the object of your love <eos> i left him to his singing <eos> i cycled home without a pause <eos> never tell a man the truth about the one that he adores <eos> on the breeze that follows sunset <eos> i could hear that sad refrain <eos> singing willow willow willow down the way <eos> and i seemed to hear it still oh <eos> vive lamore vive larmadillo <eos> be my darling armadillo all the day <eos> be my darling armadillo all the day wake up in the morning you feel out of place <eos> youre a disgrace <eos> once more with resignation <eos> but theres bills to be paid <eos> so you stumble to the station <eos> youre wearing your most imperceptible frown <eos> these people are adjectives to your proper noun <eos> as you wash through the streets of this phony old town <eos> its wearing you down <eos> and yet there you are <eos> standing out in your favourite blue dress <eos> hair is a mess <eos> nevertheless <eos> cleopatra in brooklyn <eos> you casually shed poetry like your clothes <eos> in neat little rows <eos> on the floor of my hotel room <eos> youd always dreamed that youd be a princess <eos> but youd accept less <eos> holding court holedup in your bedroom <eos> and id say i was antony begging at your door <eos> but i know that youd laugh and just ask me what for <eos> and then just roll your eyes as i fell the floor <eos> and swear that im yours <eos> and yet there you are <eos> standing out in your favourite blue dress <eos> hair is a mess <eos> nevertheless <eos> cleopatra in brooklyn <eos> you wait by the brooklyn bridge for your king to return x <eos> yeah you wait by the brooklyn bridge for your king to return <eos> then retire to your palace on smith street as the old rope burns <eos> yet there you are <eos> standing out in your favourite blue dress <eos> hair is a mess <eos> nevertheless <eos> cleopatra in brooklyn <eos> yes there you are <eos> a glittering star <eos> couldnt care less <eos> who do you impress <eos> youre my thrift store princess <eos> cleopatra in brooklyn <eos> ill come find you when the fates dessert you <eos> ill still hold you when the gods dessert you everybodys got themselves a plan <eos> everybody thinks theyll be <eos> the man including the girls <eos> the musicians who lack the friends to start a band <eos> the singer song writers <eos> the rest of us are djs or official club photographers <eos> and tonight im playing another nambooka show <eos> so im going through my phone book texting everyone i know <eos> and quite a few i dont whose numbers found their way onto my phone <eos> but i might come along anyway you never really know <eos> because none of this is going anywhere <eos> and pretty soon well all be old <eos> and no one left alive will really care <eos> about our glory days when we sold our souls <eos> but if your all about the destination <eos> then take a fucking flight <eos> where going nowhere slowly but seeing all the signs <eos> and were definitely going to hell well a teacher of mine once told me <eos> that life was just a list of disappoints and defeats <eos> and you could only do your best <eos> and i said "thats a fucking copout <eos> youre just washed up and your tired <eos> and when i get to your age i wont be such a coward" <eos> but these day i sit at home known to shout at my tv <eos> and punk rock didnt live up to what i hoped that it could be <eos> and all the things that i believed with all my heart when i was young <eos> are just coasters for beers and clean surfaces for drugs <eos> and i packed all my pamphlets with my bibles at the back of the shelf <eos> well it was bad enough the feeling and the first time it hit <eos> when you realized your parents had let the world all go to shit <eos> and that the values and ideals for which many had fought and died <eos> had been killed off in the committees and left to die by the wayside <eos> but it was worse when we turned to the kids on the left <eos> and got let down again by some poor excuse for protest <eos> yeah by idiot fucking hippies in different factions <eos> who are locked inside some kind of s battle reenactment <eos> and i hungup my banner in disgust and i head for the door <eos> oh but once we were young and we were crass enough to care <eos> but i guess you live and learn we wont make that mistake again no <eos> oh but surely just for one day we could fight and we could win <eos> and if only for a little while we could insist on the impossible <eos> well weve been a good few hours drinking <eos> so im going to say what everyones thinking <eos> if were stuck on this ship and its sinking <eos> then we might as well have a parade <eos> cos if its still going to hurt in the morning <eos> and a better plans set to get forming <eos> then wheres the harm spending an evening <eos> in manning the old barricades <eos> so come on old friends to the streets <eos> lets be but not <eos> lets be heroes lets be martyrs lets be radical thinkers <eos> who never have to test drive the least of their dreams <eos> lets divide up the world into the damned and safe <eos> and then ride to the valleys like the old life brigade <eos> and straighten our backs and we wont be afraid <eos> and theyll celebrate our deaths with a national parade our history runs down our rivers <eos> down our rivers to the sea <eos> reminds us of the things that matter <eos> home and heart and history <eos> and all our sins will be forgiven <eos> washed away to set us free <eos> by the rivers that run through our homesteads <eos> by myth and modal melody <eos> i traced these rivers from the cities to the seas <eos> to remind me of what i already know <eos> i traced the shorelines through a thousand histories <eos> to remind me an island is my home <eos> an island is my home <eos> i traveled far across this country <eos> northumberland to southern downs <eos> i wandered up the rolling humber <eos> and down the thames to london town <eos> and countless lives were lived and lingered <eos> in the cotswells and the fells <eos> i left a tapestry called england <eos> and life and those who lived it well <eos> i traced these rivers from the cities to the seas <eos> to remind me of what i already know <eos> i traced the shorelines through a thousand histories <eos> to remind me an island is my home <eos> an island is my home <eos> round here the sky is a little closer <eos> a little closer to the ground <eos> its hard for someone to get lost here <eos> harder still to get found <eos> and though ive seen a thousand rivers <eos> from the mississippi to the rhine <eos> the only place that ill lay my hat down <eos> is by an english riverside <eos> i traced these rivers from the cities to the seas <eos> to remind me of what i already know <eos> i traced the shorelines through a thousand histories <eos> to remind me an island is my home <eos> an island is my home <eos> so place your trust into the sea <eos> its kept us safe for centuries <eos> it shaped our shores and steadily <eos> its care has brought us come <eos> and when i die i hope to be buried out in english seas <eos> so all that then remains of me <eos> will lap against these shores <eos> until england is no more many years back when the old oaks were young <eos> not long after the northmen had come <eos> a low and evil deed was done <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> from the shores of normandy king william came <eos> to albion fair king harold to slay <eos> with greed in his heart and his scurrilous claim <eos> he took the land for his own <eos> he took the land for his own <eos> now john was a blacksmith an honest old man <eos> he raised up his children and worked with his hands <eos> at his familys forge in the patch of land <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> king william rode out after his victory <eos> to ravage the land in his hunger to thieve <eos> for hunting grounds in the wessex trees <eos> he took the land for his own <eos> he took the land for his own <eos> but if you steal the land of an englishman <eos> then you will know this curse <eos> your first born sons warm blood will run <eos> upon the english earth <eos> now king williams son was called rufus the red <eos> he took up the crown when his father was dead <eos> and he rode the hunting grounds in his stead <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> but johns curse it called out and lord terryl fired low <eos> the arrow struck william with a sickening blow <eos> and he fell from his horse to the ground below <eos> and the land took him for its own <eos> the land took him for its own <eos> so if you steal the land of an englishman <eos> then you will know this curse <eos> your first born sons warm blood will run <eos> upon the english earth <eos> many years back when the old oaks were young <eos> not long after the northmen had come <eos> a low and evil deed was done <eos> in the dark of the new forest <eos> in the dark of the new forest let me tell you all a little story of the things ive found <eos> hanging out and drinking with my friends in the cathedral grounds <eos> and later dodging drunks as we dance along jury street <eos> as we wander up town to the railway our friends to meet <eos> theres something about coming back to your hometown again <eos> the place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends <eos> and though none of them still live here ive got nowhere to go <eos> im a wessex boy and when im here im home <eos> let me tell you all a little story of the things ive lost <eos> huddling for warmth on the top step of the buttercross <eos> sitting on the benches by the bridges at the riverside <eos> of counting down the hours for the buses cause i missed my ride <eos> theres something about coming back to your hometown again <eos> the place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends <eos> and though none of them still live here ive got nowhere to go <eos> im a wessex boy a wessex boy and when im here im home <eos> and one day i will hear this song anonymous and sweet <eos> ringing out from a buskers guitar on the ancient city streets <eos> ill stand along while and smile before i continue on the road <eos> and somebody else will sing the words and ill feel like im home <eos> theres something about hometowns you never can escape <eos> the triumphs and the tragedies and those of little faith <eos> the welling of nostalgia and feeling kind of strange <eos> cause despite the little changes yeah this place still feels the same <eos> theres something about coming back to your hometown again <eos> the place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends <eos> and though none of them still live here ive got nowhere to go <eos> im a wessex boy <eos> im a wessex boy and when im here im home peggy came to me in my sleep <eos> in the middle of the night <eos> on a friday night last week <eos> she whispered "hush and dont be scared" <eos> got me a few words of wisdom <eos> that i came back to share <eos> and she said <eos> it doesnt matter where you come from <eos> it matters where you go <eos> no one gets remembered <eos> for the things they didnt do <eos> i said "peggy wont you stay here for awhile" <eos> we can drink whiskey <eos> we can play cards <eos> and we can get wild <eos> she said "we can play poker and well play for keeps" <eos> "i only play angels lately and they never let me cheat" <eos> it doesnt matter where you come from <eos> it matters where you go <eos> no one gets remembered <eos> in this listless life <eos> for the things they didnt do <eos> and you can say i had a good start <eos> and you could say i had class <eos> and you could say i was born beneath the ceiling made of glass <eos> but i always kept an open house <eos> and yeah i always did right by my friends <eos> and when it comes to saint peters gate <eos> i told the people remember one who needs to make amends <eos> cause better times are coming <eos> better times ahead <eos> and no one gets remembered <eos> my deathless child <eos> dont waste too long in bed <eos> and peggy said <eos> it doesnt matter where you come from <eos> it matters where you go <eos> and no one gets remembered <eos> in this listless loveless life <eos> for the things they didnt do <eos> now now now now now <eos> well peggy sang the blues <eos> ive been drifting off <eos> well peggy sang the blues <eos> and ive drifted off <eos> well peggy sang the blues <eos> and ive drifted off <eos> well peggy sang the blues <eos> peggy sang the blues i was walking home to my house through the snow from the station <eos> when springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question <eos> oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption <eos> or are we are merely biding our time down to the lonely conclusions <eos> darling let me take your hand as i talk you through this <eos> how loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis <eos> lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on takers <eos> with my feelings laid clear on the ceiling <eos> i dont think i can do this <eos> i dont think i can do this <eos> well i tried so hard to not turn into my father <eos> if i only ever skip out his choices will i ever choose better <eos> the sad truth is the grass it will always seem greener <eos> so i left you alone in a restaurant in london in winter <eos> you deserved better <eos> out of trash some might back in my ears <eos> sound comes clear and brings the awful truth that i cant stand what ive done to you <eos> and its written clear in my diary today should have been our anniversary <eos> and im far way and im far apart <eos> and youre back home with a broken heart <eos> and loves is real and i cant escape <eos> ill only ever have myself to blame <eos> these failures shift and save me in the night <eos> like a fever i cant break try as i might <eos> wake me darling i need you to take me home <eos> but i know in the end redemption is mine and mine alone not everyone grows up to be an astronaut <eos> not everyone was born to be a king <eos> not everyone can be freddie mercury <eos> but everyone can raise their glass and sing <eos> well i havent always been a perfect person <eos> well i havent done what mum and dad had dreamed <eos> but on the day i die ill say at least i fucking tried <eos> thats the only eulogy i need <eos> thats the only eulogy i need hear ye hear ye friends and romans countrymen <eos> hear ye hear ye punks and skins and journeymen <eos> hear ye hear ye my sisters and my brethren <eos> the time is coming near <eos> come ye come ye to soulless corporate circus tops <eos> come ye come ye to toilet circuit touring snobs <eos> come ye come ye to bedrooms bars and bunker squats <eos> the sound is ringing clear <eos> now whod have thought that after all <eos> something as simple as rock n roll would save us all <eos> and whod have thought that after all it was rock n roll <eos> hear ye hear ye now anybody could take this stage <eos> hear ye hear ye and make miracles for minimum wage <eos> hear ye hear ye these folk songs for the modern age <eos> will hold us in their arms <eos> right here right now elvis brings his children home <eos> right here right now you never have to feel alone <eos> right here right now teenage kicks and gramophones <eos> we hold them in our hearts <eos> now whod have thought that after all <eos> something as simple as rock n roll would save us all <eos> now whod have thought that after all it was rock n roll <eos> and i still believe i still believe in the saints <eos> yeah in jerry lee and in johnny and all the greats <eos> and i still believe i still believe in the sound <eos> that has the power to raise a temple and tear it down <eos> and i still believe i still believe in the need <eos> for guitars and drums and desperate poetry <eos> and i still believe i still believe that everyone <eos> can find a song for every time theyve lost and every time theyve won <eos> so just remember folks we not just saving lives were saving souls <eos> and were having fun <eos> and i still believe <eos> now whod have thought that after all <eos> something as simple as rock n roll would save us all <eos> now whod have thought that after all <eos> something so simple something so small <eos> whod have thought that after all its rock n roll eva mae <eos> i remember the date you were born <eos> it was the summer <eos> your mum and dad called me up to say how proud <eos> they were <eos> voices wringing with the love of a new born child <eos> light shining in their eyes expectant smiles <eos> eva mae <eos> well your father and i have been friends <eos> many years <eos> watched the world around us change <eos> hoped our hopes feared our fears <eos> he asked me to watch you as you grow <eos> hold your hand through the highs and lift you up through the lows <eos> now eva mae <eos> dont you judge me too hard <eos> i try to be a good man to make the best with what i got <eos> eva mae <eos> i will teach you what i know <eos> and watch over you everywhere that you go <eos> eva mae <eos> i have made many mistakes <eos> in my time <eos> burnt my share of bridges and broken hearts <eos> ive told lies <eos> i have not always followed my own advice <eos> ive fallen flat <eos> but eva darling sometimes thats just life <eos> eva mae <eos> with the way that i am i might not <eos> much be around <eos> but ill stop in from time to time to share <eos> the things ive learnt <eos> you should keep your friends and family close <eos> and you should always always always try to say yes <eos> and we can not ever one of us be perfect <eos> but eva darling we can try our best <eos> now eva mae <eos> i wont ever judge you hard <eos> just try to be a good girl and do the best with what you got <eos> now eva mae <eos> i will teach you what i know <eos> and watch over you everywhere that you go <eos> everywhere you go i have wept until ive slept <eos> into the lap of the lady that i love <eos> and though she begged and she cajoled <eos> i couldnt tell her what i was thinking of <eos> i didnt chose no i was chosen <eos> by a life that must be lived in passing through <eos> and though she changed so much of me <eos> changing this is the one thing i cannot do <eos> darling im leaving <eos> the distance keeps calling me on <eos> darling come morning <eos> ill be gone <eos> she is beauty she is graceful <eos> in a poison she is gentle in her care <eos> she is the calm within the centre of my storm <eos> she is her fingers through my hair <eos> she has my heart but it is breaking <eos> cause it knows that deep inside she still believes <eos> that there will ever come a morning when im staying <eos> not gathering to leave <eos> darling im leaving <eos> the distance keeps calling me on <eos> darling come morning <eos> ill be gone <eos> baby lets get out of the city <eos> we need to breathe some cleaner air <eos> that creeping feeling starting like i miss you <eos> and were both of us still here <eos> theres a sadness in your smiles now <eos> and an edge of desperation in your voice <eos> we have all this independence <eos> but it still feels like we never had a choice <eos> darling im leaving so this songs for josh <eos> why didnt you call <eos> my phones always on <eos> why didnt you call <eos> before you got gone <eos> and i cant say for certain what i would have said <eos> but now i am helplessly silent instead <eos> theres a hole in my heart and in my head <eos> why didnt you call <eos> why didnt you say something on the last time we met <eos> why didnt you say something theres always hope left <eos> and i cant say for certain what i would have done <eos> but i cant do anything now that youre gone <eos> and it kills me to think that for a second you felt alone <eos> now you can measure the mark of a man on the day that he died <eos> in the mixture of memory and wreckage that he leaves behind <eos> and i know you were carrying too much weight on the evening when you slipped away <eos> but i loved you like a brother man and i never really had a chance to say <eos> so at half past nine each evening ill think of my friend <eos> and at half past nine ill remember you were better than your end <eos> cause i too have stood up on that ledge <eos> but i know youd have pulled me back down from the edge <eos> and i let you down in your darkness i wasnt there <eos> so ill remember you making a hole through the kids in the crowd <eos> and i remember you lifting me up each time i fell down <eos> and ill glance at the barrier when im watching the band <eos> and ill expect to see you there stood on the foot stand <eos> but i guess i will see someone else <eos> thats when ill whisper to myself <eos> brother i miss you like hell <eos> thanks very much <eos> thats for josh burdette <eos> lets hear it for josh come on on the twenty eight of january nineteen sixty six <eos> christa mcauliffe gazed in horror as the orings failed <eos> and she died and she died and she died <eos> for the next agonising two minutes and forty five seconds <eos> she called out the truth on a broken radio <eos> im alive im alive im alive <eos> it came as some surprise to realise that as she lost everything <eos> the world was revealing a transmission so real that she understood everything <eos> youre still alive youre still alive <eos> four thousand nautical miles as the crow flies away <eos> a home made ham radio <eos> in the loft of a hampshire family home <eos> came alive came alive came alive <eos> and so the poor old amateur operator thus became the only person to hear <eos> christas last desperate communique <eos> were alive were alive were alive <eos> it came as some surprise to realise what he didnt catch everything <eos> the world was revealing a transmission so real that he understood everything <eos> youre still alive lord save me from those with my best interests at heart <eos> lord save me from sleeves emblazoned with hearts <eos> from fools who place horses in front of their carts <eos> who care less for learning than teaching <eos> for they know not of what they are speaking <eos> yeah youre marching in matching che guevara t shirts <eos> youre so damn conceited its starting to hurt <eos> you were born in to freedom so you dont know its worth <eos> and you constantly speak of solutions <eos> but you only repeat revolution <eos> when you live with your parents your ideals come cheap <eos> but what of the families with children to feed <eos> for the ones whove scored riches have more than they need <eos> while the rest of us think of survival <eos> your money can pay for your morals <eos> you say that for omelettes youre gonna need to break eggs <eos> but if you follow your logic youre soon breaking heads <eos> to patch your polemic you tear us to shreds <eos> youd steal all our voices for your thunder <eos> for your politics nothing but plunder <eos> and we will not be judged or be put into place <eos> as no more than members of class are of race <eos> were free individuals and thats what you hate <eos> our society is not a machine <eos> you can steer or shut down as you please <eos> and one day youll struggle to make your ends meet <eos> and one day youll struggle to stand on your feet <eos> and youll find something true thatll make your heart beat <eos> and youll sacrfice something of meaning <eos> and youll understand something of freedom by the waters of the thames <eos> i resolve to start again <eos> to wash my feet and cleanse my sins <eos> to lose my cobwebs on the wind <eos> to fix the parts of me i broke <eos> to speak out loud the things i know <eos> i havent been myself <eos> wandering rosebery avenue <eos> i could only think of you <eos> facing samuel johnson down <eos> wear down london town <eos> a glance to take my breath away <eos> and drag me south from holloway <eos> you and no one else <eos> and the king of a kingdom of mistakes <eos> ive broken all the things that i could break <eos> fuck the fishing i will abdicate <eos> and meet you on the corner of the upper street and the city road <eos> and you of course the angel islington <eos> ah come on a boy could hope <eos> by the waters of the thames <eos> i resolve to start again yeah

<eos> its easy enough to talk about blitz spirit <eos> when youre not holding the roof up and knee deep in it <eos> and the pictures and the papers got ruined by the rain <eos> and we wondered if theyd ever get dry again <eos> but i dont want spend the whole of my life indoors <eos> laying low waiting on the next storm <eos> i dont want spend the whole of my life inside <eos> i wanna step out and face the sunshine <eos> we lost faith in the omens <eos> we lost faith in the gods <eos> we just ended up clutching at the empty rituals <eos> like gamblers clutching long odds <eos> and i dont care what the weatherman is saying <eos> because the last time that i saw him he was on his needs knees he was praying <eos> and the preachers and the scientists got soaked just the same <eos> and we wondered if wed ever get dry again <eos> but i dont want spend the whole of my life indoors <eos> laying low waiting on the next storm <eos> i dont want spend the whole of my life inside <eos> i wanna step out and face the sunshine <eos> so open the shutters raise up the mast <eos> rejoice rebuild the storm has passed <eos> cast off the crutches cut off the cast <eos> rejoice rebuild the storm has passed <eos> rejoice rebuild the storm has passed <eos> i dont want spend the whole of my life indoors <eos> laying low waiting on the next storm <eos> i dont want spend the whole of my life inside <eos> i wanna step out and face the sunshine <eos> im not gonna live the whole of my life indoors <eos> im gonna step out and face the next storm i got me a shovel <eos> and im digging a ditch <eos> and im going to fight for this four square feet of land like a mean old son of a bitch <eos> i got me a future <eos> im not stuck on the past <eos> i got no new tricks yeah im up on bricks but me <eos> im a machine and i was built to last <eos> im trying to get better because i havent been my best <eos> she took a plain black marker started writing on my chest <eos> she drew a line across the middle of my broken heart <eos> and said come on now lets fix this mess <eos> we could get better <eos> because were not dead yet <eos> they threw me a whirlwind <eos> and i spat back the sea <eos> i took a battering but ive got thicker skin and the best people <eos> i know looking out for me <eos> so im taking the high road <eos> my engines running high and fine <eos> may i always see the road rising up to meet me <eos> and my enemies defeated in the mirror behind <eos> im trying to get better because i havent been my best <eos> she took a plain black marker started writing on my chest <eos> she drew a line across the middle of my broken heart <eos> and said "come on now lets fix this mess" <eos> we could get better <eos> because were not dead yet <eos> its just a knot in the small of your back <eos> you could work it out with your fingers <eos> its just a tune that got stuck in your head <eos> you could work it out with your fingers <eos> its just some numbers tangled up in your sums <eos> you could work it out with your fingers <eos> its just a simple braille mission from the person you miss <eos> a reminder you could always be <eos> a little bit better than this <eos> so try and get better and dont ever accept less <eos> take a plain black marker and write this on your chest <eos> draw a line underneath all of this unhappiness <eos> come on now lets fix this mess <eos> we could get better <eos> because were not dead yet <eos> we could get better <eos> because were not dead yet can see you hurting beneath your new red dress <eos> beneath your sharp new shoes and your new tattoos you are directionless <eos> and i know youve been working as hard as you can <eos> to preempt the question the expectation and i understand <eos> so come on now if we all pull together <eos> we can lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders <eos> lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders <eos> just for a moment or two <eos> from the moment the phone alarm

store that sold postcards by the yard <eos> i bought a mile and shipped them home so i could read <eos> ten thousand tenword tragedies the lives these strangers lead <eos> to remind myself the things i need <eos> cause i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> you left me feeling like <eos> wed never really been in love <eos> huddled home up in my place in holloway <eos> i wondered if you ever heard those songs i used to play <eos> i wrote them as a gift for you and in return <eos> you gave a pair of hand knit mittens to keep my fingers warm <eos> so i could play more ignored love songs <eos> i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> and i once wrote you postcards <eos> you never wrote back <eos> promised me you would and im still waiting for them <eos> you left me feeling like <eos> wed never really been in love <eos> dont wanna fit like mittens <eos> i wanna fit like gloves <eos> wanna fit like gloves <eos> i once wrote you love songs <eos> you never fell in love <eos> we used to fit like mittens but never like gloves <eos> never like gloves one two three four <eos> oh somewhere down the road theres a ditch where theres a hole <eos> which marks the spot where you will lie when you are cold <eos> and you can run you can hide you can bitch and you can whine <eos> but you will never save your life <eos> when you meet death <eos> be out of breath <eos> and say youre pleased to see him cause youre tired <eos> now you can go down with the wreck or you can scurry from the deck <eos> but theres no way to save your skinny little neck <eos> and you can pray to who you please and you can fall down on your knees <eos> but your feet will still get wet <eos> when you meet death <eos> be out of breath <eos> and say youre pleased to see him cause youre tired <eos> of wondering how much time youve got left <eos> of worrying that youre no good at chess <eos> its your funeral anyway <eos> choose your game <eos> then lets play <eos> when you meet death <eos> be out of breath <eos> and say youre pleased to see him <eos> in fact youre waiting for this meeting <eos> and quite frankly his timekeeping leaves a lot to be desired <eos> so tell that bastard that hes fired god dammit amy were not kids any more <eos> you cant just keep waltzing out of my life <eos> leaving clothes on my bedroom floor <eos> like nothing really matters like pain doesnt hurt <eos> you should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt <eos> you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that i made when i was a kid <eos> with a disassembled disposable razor i stole from my dad <eos> when i thought that suffering was something profound <eos> that weighed down on wise heads <eos> and not just something to be avoided <eos> something normal people dread <eos> god dammit amy well of course ive changed <eos> with all the things ive done and the places ive been <eos> id be a machine if i had stayed the same <eos> but youre still back where we started you havent changed at all <eos> youre still trying to live like a kid like you can always have it all <eos> you know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that i hid as best i could <eos> that i covered with ink but in the right kind of light they still bleed through <eos> showing that there are some things i just cant change no matter what i do <eos> the telltale signs of being used <eos> of being trapped inside of you <eos> youre a beautiful butterfly <eos> burned with a branding iron <eos> onto my outsides into my insides <eos> as a simple sign <eos> to show off your ownership <eos> burned into my naked skin <eos> onto my outsides into my insides <eos> its not even love any more <eos> its just a claim upon my soul <eos> it stains my skin yeah its on my breath <eos> and im ashamed to get undressed <eos> in front of strangers in case they see <eos> the tell tale signs that you have left all over me <eos> god dammit amy <eos> youll always remind me of scars on my arms that i know will never fade <eos> and its not like its something i think about each and every day <eos> i just occasionally catch myself scratching them as if theyd ever go away <eos> but these tell tale signs are here to stay and in the end you know thats ok <eos> you will always be a part of my patchedup patchwork tapedup tapedeck heart verse <eos> i remember the first night i met you <eos> you brushed past my arm at the bar <eos> and suddenly it was like somebody somewhere <eos> scraped their keys down the side of my heart <eos> heart that been stuck in traffic <eos> and someone interminably unchanging red light <eos> youve beckoned me off down a side street <eos> and i followed you into the night <eos> hook <eos> youre weary and you wise like athena <eos> like artemis youre wild and youre free <eos> youre carrying yourself like youre hera <eos> but quietly youll always be little aphrodite to me <eos> verse <eos> now i remember on the first night i met you <eos> how could i ever forget <eos> you were trading my drinks for acrossthebar winks <eos> like some rumour that i havent heard yet <eos> when i stumble onto you outside <eos> i said i was sorry but that was kind of a lie <eos> ive been waiting for you <eos> and i knew that you knew <eos> you still laughed you still acted surprised <eos> bridge <eos> and its lamely ridiculous for me to be said that im sure <eos> but if i had an apple to give <eos> then it would be yours <eos> and the others would rage as i turned them away <eos> but youve followed me down to the shore <eos> and for you id start a war <eos> so darling yes im sure as i walked out one morning fair <eos> i found myself drawn thoughtlessly <eos> back to the place we used to live <eos> and you still do now without me <eos> around the back away from the road <eos> behind the bins beneath your window <eos> i found the hulk the rusting bulk <eos> of a shattered old piano <eos> someone had torn out some of the keys <eos> with cruel care not thoughtlessly <eos> in such a way that one could only play <eos> minor melodies <eos> so i sat down in my sadness beneath your window <eos> and i played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano <eos> a sinner amongst saved men on the banks of the muddy thames <eos> as i have wandered through this city <eos> like a child lost in the london fog <eos> from highgate hill down to the river <eos> then washed downstream past the isle of dogs <eos> ive had time enough to think upon <eos> the question of what kind of songs <eos> that you would choose to listen to <eos> now that i am gone <eos> and as i drift beneath that bridge <eos> just down the road from where you live <eos> ive often thought i might have caught <eos> your voice upon the wind <eos> but as i stroked those broken keys <eos> you did not join in harmony in the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway american dream <eos> at night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines <eos> sprung from cages out on highway nine <eos> chrome wheeled fuel injectedand steppin out over the line <eos> hoh baby this town rips the bones from your back <eos> its a death trap its a suicide rap <eos> we gotta get out while were young <eos> cause tramps like us baby we were born to run <eos> yes girl we were <eos> wendy let me in i wanna be your friend <eos> i want to guard your dreams and visions <eos> just wrap your legs round these velvet rims <eos> and strap your hands cross my engines <eos> together we could break this trap <eos> well run till we drop baby well never go back <eos> hoh will you walk with me out on the wire <eos> cause baby im just a scared and lonely rider <eos> but i gotta know how it feels <eos> i want to know if love is wild <eos> babe i want to know if love is real <eos> oh can you show me <eos> beyond the palace hemipowered drones scream down the boulevard <eos> girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors <eos> and the boys try to look so hard <eos> the amusement park rises bold and stark <eos> kids are huddled on the beach in a mist <eos> i wanna die with you wendy on the street tonight <eos> in an everlasting kiss <eos> one two three four <eos> the highways jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive <eos> everybodys out on the run tonight <eos> but theres no place left to hide <eos> together wendy we can live with the sadness <eos> ill love you with all the madness in my soul <eos> hoh someday girl i dont know when <eos> were gonna get to that place <eos> where we really wanna go <eos> and well walk in the sun <eos> but till then tramps like us <eos> baby we were born to run <eos> oh honey tramps like us <eos> baby we were born to run <eos> come on with me tramps like us <eos> baby we were born to run some mornings i pray for evening <eos> for the day to be done <eos> some summer days i hide away <eos> and wait for rain to come <eos> cause it turns out hell will not be found <eos> within the fires below <eos> but in making do and muddling through <eos> when youve nowhere else to go <eos> but then i remember you <eos> and the way you shine like truth in all you do <eos> and if you remembered me <eos> you could save me from the way i tend to be <eos> the way i tend to be <eos> some days i wake up dazed my dear <eos> and dont know where i am <eos> ive been running now so long im scared <eos> ive forgotten how to stand <eos> and i stand alone in airport bars <eos> and gather thoughts to think <eos> that if all i had was one long road <eos> it could drive a man to drink <eos> but then i remember you <eos> and the way you shine like truth in all you do <eos> and if you remembered me <eos> you could save me from the way i tend to be <eos> because ive said i love you so many times that the words kinda die in my mouth <eos> and i meant it each time with each beautiful woman but somehow it never works out <eos> you stood apart in my calloused heart and you taught me and heres what i learned <eos> that love is about the changes you make and not just three small words <eos> and then i catch myself <eos> catching your scent on someone else <eos> in a crowded space <eos> and it takes me somewhere i cannot quite place <eos> but then i remember you <eos> and the way you shine like truth in all you do <eos> and if you remembered me <eos> you could save me from the way i tend to be <eos> the way i tend to be <eos> the way i tend to be <eos> the way i tend to be oh the birds are ringing in <eos> the opening act of spring <eos> and i have fallen down and im so much worse than i have ever been <eos> oh the seasons acting strange <eos> and i know that something has to change <eos> but there is no path i can choose that will not bring somebody pain <eos> please forgive me for the things that i must do <eos> i have hurt so many people it was never my intention to hurt you <eos> oh the clouds have gathered thick <eos> and in my stomach i feel sick <eos> and i have all this drive and no idea what i should do with it <eos> but they say there is a calm <eos> after the passing of the storm <eos> so i can dream of going back outside when the rain and thunders done <eos> i know the old folks say <eos> they can tell which way the weathers going <eos> tell which way the wind is blowing <eos> watching careful for the <eos> signs among the little thing <eos> the barking dogs the birds on wing <eos> i am deaf and blind <eos> and i cant say if i can change <eos> patterns that have caused you pain <eos> well i was raised in suburbs <eos> sheltered from the sun and rain <eos> far away from subtle seasons change <eos> oh baby i will read <eos> about the buzzing of the bees <eos> about the grass and snakes and spawning lakes and the different types of trees <eos> and i will find a way <eos> that leads from cruel april into may <eos> and someday soon it will be june and youll decide to stay <eos> please forgive me for the things that i have done <eos> i will carry your umbrella in the summer <eos> and ill shade you from the sun i heard the name josephine <eos> it came to me in dream <eos> and i dont usually set too much store by the things that these things might mean <eos> it was spoken with seriousness <eos> more of a whisper than a scream <eos> now im waiting on this josephine <eos> to show herself to me <eos> could have been anyone <eos> i imagined i could be <eos> i just needed somebody <eos> to show me how to be <eos> i could have been napoleon

quick sharp <eos> after every slip and stumble <eos> but these days im collecting scars that dont seem to fade <eos> cuts and bruises that wont go away <eos> and i used to think that i <eos> would never live past twenty five <eos> and when you think like that each day <eos> is a gift if you survive <eos> but ive survived too long for my side of the deal <eos> and as i reach that shore im not sure how to feel <eos> cause i keep losing days <eos> that used to take a lifetime <eos> in the blinking of an eye <eos> and all these small ideas <eos> are suddenly commitments <eos> as greatness slips on by <eos> greatness slips on by <eos> i remember well the day that i got my first tattoo <eos> i was so scared before and after i was so proud when it was new <eos> but these days ive gone and got me many more <eos> and sometimes i get more when i get bored <eos> one for every year ive lost references <eos> people and things <eos> black flag <eos> bob dylan <eos> boudecia <eos> lewis

youve gone too far <eos> weve listened to songbirds and rush hour cars and welcomed in the day <eos> peace in london in summertime is great <eos> on days like this i feel like i can escape <eos> and things that ive done and mistakes that ive made <eos> i can wash it all away <eos> chorus <eos> we bathed like swimmers in the morning sun and waited for our night to end <eos> we knew that one of us would come down hard and one of us would start again <eos> we started out curious it started out fun <eos> we smoked in the woods when we were young <eos> and secretly slipped something under our tongues <eos> and danced the night away <eos> but everyone stumbles on old cocaine <eos> it burns up the best and it burdens the brain <eos> til brown comes and whispers away the pain and you find youve lost your way <eos> chorus <eos> youd sink in the river for your death <eos> youd sleep with the fishes and draw no breath <eos> youd swallow forever till nothings left <eos> take no rest <eos> oh my friend if you made for the shore <eos> youd see us here <eos> were all waiting <eos> just cast your eyes down to the floor <eos> youll see us here <eos> were waiting <eos> dont sink in the river for your death <eos> you can sleep in the shade and draw some breath <eos> you could start fresh tomorrow and leave whats left <eos> please draw breath <eos> please draw breath <eos> lets let nights become days <eos> so come down kid the roofs not safe now <eos> all your friends are waiting for you to get some rest forgive me someone for i have sinned <eos> and i know not where i should begin <eos> and some days it feels like you just cant win <eos> no matter what you do or say <eos> things didnt kill me but i dont feel stronger <eos> life is short but it feels much longer <eos> when youve lost that fight yeah youve lost that hunger <eos> to pull yourself through the day <eos> but if ever i stray from the path i follow <eos> take me down to the english channel <eos> throw me in where the water is shallow <eos> and then drag me on back to shore <eos> cause love is free and life is cheap <eos> and as long as ive got me a place to sleep <eos> some clothes on my back and some food to eat <eos> then i cant ask for anything more <eos> so come on everybody sing it one two three four <eos> we all have secrets that we hold inside <eos> the worst little things that you never confide <eos> and the worst one of all that you just cant hide <eos> is that youre never quite as strong as you sound <eos> so im sorry baby for the times ive hurt you <eos> sorry friends for the times i desert you <eos> most days it feels like i dont deserve you <eos> and i wonder that youre all still around <eos> so if ever i stray from the path i follow <eos> take me down to the english channel <eos> throw me in where the water is shallow <eos> and then drag me on back to shore <eos> cause love is free and life is cheap <eos> as long as ive got me a place to sleep <eos> some clothes on my back and some food to eat <eos> then i cant ask for anything more <eos> so come on everybody sing it one two three four <eos> come on and join me in the water <eos> swim for hope <eos> sometimes its hard to remember <eos> i couldnt do this on my own <eos> if ever i stray from the path i follow <eos> take me down to the english channel <eos> throw me in where the water is shallow <eos> and then drag me on back to shore <eos> cause love is free and life is cheap <eos> as long as ive got me a place to sleep <eos> some clothes on my back and some food to eat <eos> i cant ask for anything more <eos> i cant ask for anything more <eos> the path i chose isnt straight and narrow <eos> it wanders round like a drunken fellow <eos> some days its hard for me to follow <eos> but if youve got my back ill go on <eos> if youve got my back ill go on i keep having dreams <eos> of pioneers and pirate ships and bob dylan <eos> of people wrapped up tight in the things that will kill them <eos> of being trapped in a lift plunging straight to the bottom <eos> of open seas and ways of life weve forgotten <eos> i keep having dreams <eos> amy worked in a bar in exeter <eos> i went back to her house and i slept beside her <eos> she woke up screaming in the middle of the night <eos> terrified of her own insides <eos> dreams of pirate ships and patty hearst <eos> breaking through a life overrehearsed <eos> she cant remember which came first <eos> the house the home or the terrible thirst <eos> she keeps having dreams <eos> and on the worst days <eos> when it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons <eos> shes got her cowboy boots and car keys on the bed stand <eos> so she can always run <eos> she can get up shower and in half an hour shell be gone <eos> i keep having dreams of things i need to do <eos> and waking up and not following through <eos> but it feels like i havent slept at all <eos> when i wake to a silence and shes facing the wall <eos> posters of dylan and of hemingway <eos> an antique compass for a sailors escape <eos> she says you just cant live this way <eos> and i close my eyes and i never say <eos> im still having dreams <eos> and on the worst days <eos> when it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons <eos> i sleep with my passport <eos> one eye on the back door <eos> so i can always run <eos> i can get up shower and in half an hour ill be gone <eos> and come morning <eos> i am disappeared <eos> just an imprint on the bedsheets <eos> im by the roadside with my thumb out <eos> a car pulls up and bobs driving <eos> so i climb in <eos> we dont say a word <eos> as we pull off into the sunrise <eos> and these rivers of tarmac are like arteries across the country <eos> we are blood cells alive in the bloodstream <eos> the beating heart of the country <eos> we are electric pulses <eos> in the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country <eos> we are electric pulses <eos> in the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country <eos> we are electric pulses <eos> the sleeping soul of the country <eos> the sleeping soul of the country <eos> the sleeping soul of the country brothers and sisters have you heard the news <eos> the storm has lifted and theres nothing to lose <eos> so swap your confirmation for your dancing shoes <eos> because there never was no god <eos> step out of the darkness and onto the streets <eos> forget about the fast lets have a carnival feast <eos> raise up your lowered head and hear the liberation beat <eos> because there never was no god <eos> there is no god <eos> so clap your hands together <eos> there is no god <eos> no heaven and no hell <eos> but there is no god <eos> were all in this together <eos> there is no god <eos> so ring that victory bell <eos> no cowering in the dark before these overbearing priests <eos> not waiting until we die until we restitute the meek <eos> no blaming all our failings on imaginary beasts <eos> because there never was no god <eos> no fighting over land your distant fathers told you of <eos> not spilling blood for those who have never spread a drop of love <eos> no finger pointing justified by phantoms up above <eos> because there never was no god <eos> there is no god <eos> so clap your hands together <eos> there is no god <eos> no heaven and no hell <eos> there is no god <eos> were all in this together <eos> there is no god <eos> so ring that victory bell <eos> i know youre scared of dying man and i am too <eos> but just pretending its not happening isnt gonna see us through <eos> if we accept that theres an end game and we havent got much time <eos> then in the here and now then we can try and do things right <eos> wed be our own salvation army and together wed believe <eos> in all the wondrous things mere mortals can achieve <eos> well ive known beauty in the stillness of cathedrals in the day <eos> ive sung glory hallelujah wont wash my sins away <eos> but now im singing my refrain and this is what i say <eos> i say there never was no god <eos> there is no god <eos> so clap your hands together <eos> there is no god <eos> no heaven and no hell <eos> but there is no god <eos> were all in this together <eos> there is no god <eos> so ring

<eos> so ring that victory bell man we used to be brothers <eos> superheroes and warriors <eos> cowboys and indians train drivers <eos> everything rolling through the endless summers <eos> but everything changes <eos> you got married had children <eos> and i dont have your number <eos> the one i can remember is that place you used to live with your parents <eos> but in the stillness of the moment it takes for a polaroid picture <eos> to capture our faces forever and <eos> the world has turned a touch on its axis <eos> and the only thing certain is <eos> that everything changes <eos> and they closed the astoria <eos> at the end of last summer <eos> the place we earned our pedigrees <eos> scene of our victories <eos> sanctuary in the centre of london <eos> now theyre building a railway <eos> to track the vanquished to versailles <eos> and singalongs on on <eos> but theyre singing different songs <eos> in rooms that we dont know on the other side of the city <eos> but in the stillness of the moment it takes for a polaroid picture <eos> to capture our faces forever and <eos> the world has turned a touch on its axis <eos> and the only thing certain is <eos> that everything changes <eos> so honey i just need a little time <eos> to take a little time today <eos> to save all the triumphs and tragedies <eos> before they slip away <eos> before they slip away <eos> let go of the little distractions <eos> hold close to the ones that you love <eos> because we wont all be here this time next year <eos> so while you can take a picture of us <eos> let go of the little distractions <eos> hold close to the ones that you love <eos> because we wont all be here this time next year <eos> so while you can take a picture of us <eos> take a polaroid picture <eos> let go of the little distractions <eos> hold close to the ones that you love <eos> take a picture of us to show <eos> we all want you to see where time goes <eos> so in the stillness of the moment <eos> make sure you take a polaroid picture <eos> and keep it with you forever to <eos> remind yourself that everything changes <eos> but there was this one time <eos> man there was this one time <eos> when things were okay oh its payday yes its payday <eos> i got my pay check from the man <eos> theres not so many jobs that i can get these days <eos> with these marks all over my hands <eos> but im gonna take that check <eos> im gonna head across the track <eos> to the wrong side of this town <eos> im gonna open the door <eos> im gonna bask in the roar <eos> of that familiar buzzing needle sound <eos> because the ink in my skin <eos> where the needle went in <eos> however many years ago <eos> has left marks on my arms <eos> and they say who i am <eos> everywhere that i go <eos> some people have one and <eos> some have one that theyre ashamed of <eos> most people think that were fools <eos> some people dont get it and <eos> some people dont care <eos> and some of us we have tattoos <eos> oh its fading yes its fading <eos> some of the things that i believed back then <eos> yes my skin has started sagging and <eos> the ink has started running <eos> and ive got buddy tattoos with people <eos> who arent friends <eos> oh ive even got black xs from when i was straight edge <eos> so crack open a beer friends now <eos> and lets make a pledge <eos> if we had the luck to live our lives <eos> a second time through wed be sure to get the same tattoos <eos> because the ink in my skin <eos> where the needle went in <eos> however many years ago <eos> has left marks on my arms <eos> and they say who i am <eos> everywhere that i go <eos> some people have one and <eos> some have one that theyre ashamed of <eos> most people think that were fools <eos> some people dont get it and <eos> some people dont care <eos> and some of us we have tattoos <eos> weve got hearts for the lovers <eos> and playing cards for the gamblers <eos> black flag bars for the punks <eos> and sailing ships for the ramblers <eos> we got skulls for the living <eos> and the pain pays our dues <eos> and some of us we have tattoos one day i hope to see the world <eos> through another persons eyes <eos> and breathe in everything they think of <eos> to make sure everythings alright <eos> to know that everyones the same <eos> the most composed are just as lost <eos> while you may have it all set up <eos> you can only work with what youve got <eos> since we were kids <eos> and we were ambitious <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> but now you will find me <eos> cold but breathing <eos> where i was left <eos> where i was left <eos> and every time i catch my breath <eos> i feel my body getting tense <eos> and when you find theres no design in anything <eos> its nothing new but little help <eos> since we were kids <eos> and we were ambitious <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> but now you will find me <eos> cold but breathing <eos> where i was left <eos> where i was left <eos> when you dont feel you know <eos> what it is that youve missed <eos> and the sting of regret <eos> is the taste of your lips <eos> youre some way to go <eos> youre some way to go <eos> you move the right way and you know <eos> youre finally there <eos> where you go then youll know <eos> what it is that you missed <eos> is the taste of your lips <eos> since we were kids <eos> and we were ambitious <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> you see it starts like this <eos> but now you will find me <eos> cold but breathing <eos> where i was left <eos> where i was left verse <eos> all of the stars are singing notes ive never heard <eos> let em ring <eos> because in time well play the chords that i prefer <eos> and let em dance like young birds <eos> give me more time i will replace these things <eos> with diamonds and pearls that shine and sing <eos> like wedding rings <eos> and will i have the time to say goodbye <eos> chorus <eos> cause i am the darkness in the sky <eos> sweeping winds that haunt the night <eos> the burning fire from deep inside <eos> will come undone <eos> and give me another time to fight <eos> another chance to say good bye <eos> i wasnt prepared to let the light come undone <eos> verse <eos> another painful day my hands are red and torn <eos> from crawling across the floor my knees are cracked and worn <eos> i sat outside till the morning broke the sky <eos> singin painful melodies in the storm <eos> chorus <eos> cause i am the darkness in the sky <eos> sweeping winds that haunt the night <eos> the burning fire from deep inside <eos> will come undone <eos> and give me another time to fight <eos> another chance to say good bye <eos> i wasnt prepared to let the light come undone <eos> chorus <eos> cause i am the darkness in the sky <eos> sweeping winds that haunt the night <eos> the burning fire from deep inside <eos> will come undone come undone <eos> and give me another time to fight <eos> another chance to say good bye <eos> i wasnt prepared to let the light come undone come undone <eos> come undoooone oh no <eos> come undoooone oh no <eos> verse <eos> all of the stars are singing notes ive never heard <eos> the swallow and finch will leave the nest and emerge <eos> so let em dance like young birds theres a space between dark matter the pupils of your eyes <eos> a classroom of stars make

words that escape from my chest <eos> let the birds fly for winter to the heat of the south <eos> i will die by the summer i will die by myself <eos> in the freshest of airs the calmest of storms <eos> with the blue lights approaching ill lay in your arms <eos> i will die like religion im weak with my facts <eos> but the people will wait oh the birds will come back <eos> so father believe me

<eos> oh ill follow the birds <eos> cause theyre always there to chase there was a storm <eos> there was a storm of a thousand seas <eos> and ill raise my glass before you notice me <eos> ill raise my glass before you notice me <eos> but youre too far to save <eos> and drowned at sea <eos> and there was a storm <eos> there was a storm of a thousand clouds <eos> and the rain did fall till the house went down <eos> the rain did fall till the house went down <eos> and it merged the sea and the lands around <eos> and oh what a fight <eos> oh what a fight of a thousand words <eos> and most of them made up to the lies that i heard <eos> most of them made up to the lies that i heard <eos> so i left you there <eos> and there was a storm <eos> there was a storm the skies aglow <eos> and i was by the sea with pockets of stone <eos> so i rushed back to town to let everyone know <eos> but it caught up with me and it swept me home <eos> and i saw my house <eos> i saw my house was broken and gone <eos> i saw this i knew that something was wrong <eos> so i pulled away roofing and timber and stone <eos> but i couldnt find you anywhere <eos> my hands were numb <eos> and oh when you died <eos> oh when you died <eos> it was only my fault <eos> i wasnt there when the storm came <eos> wasnt there to revolt <eos> to hold my head skywards and let the rain know <eos> if its taking us then then its taking us both january starts without much sympathy <eos> just like every dog thats let loose right in front of me <eos> this time next year things will settle slowly <eos> like a rush of blood <eos> the fear my heart beholds of me <eos> your better days are yet to come <eos> to silence fights the beating drums <eos> the eloquent the yet to know the will it hurt <eos> the will it hold <eos> and although this rain has lasted us quite long enough <eos> its been several months without the sleep to comfort us <eos> can you hear the dogs theyre howling down below <eos> its a fervent ground you can feel it <eos> but you will never know <eos> that better days are yet to come <eos> to silence fights the beating drums <eos> the eloquence the yet to know <eos> the "will it hurt" the "will it hold" <eos> this night wont satisfy me <eos> this fear wont bring me to the ground <eos> i know youre scared of hiding <eos> i know youre aching to be found <eos> i know youre aching to be found <eos> i know youre aching to be <eos> this night wont satisfy me <eos> this fear wont bring me to the ground <eos> i know youre scared of hiding <eos> i know youre aching to be found <eos> i know youre aching to be found <eos> i know youre aching to be cause my arms would die without your hands to live <eos> and your arms will lie parallel to his <eos> and i wont be fooled as long as i dont hear <eos> that you have been whispering <eos> sweet nothings in his ear <eos> and one of these days hell screw up <eos> and oh youll question the love <eos> and i will be waiting there for you <eos> to wander back <eos> cause you deserve more than that <eos> cause you deserve more than that <eos> youll pardon his thinking <eos> all the fights he dragged you through <eos> and i learned of his shortcomings <eos> when i got to lie with you <eos> the ways that we differ <eos> and ways you can begin <eos> to bring back the green in your eyes <eos> the sadness from your skin <eos> and one of these days youll grow up <eos> and oh youll question a love <eos> that never fulfilled you from the start <eos> it wont take long to mend a broken heart <eos> deserves more than that <eos> cause it deserves more than that <eos> youll wait for a break <eos> then the morning comes <eos> and it feels like a burning <eos> burning touch of the sun <eos> it feels like broken glass <eos> the shot of a gun <eos> and one of these days hell screw up <eos> and oh youll question the love <eos> and i will be waiting there for you <eos> to wander back <eos> and one of these days youll grow up <eos> and oh youll question a love <eos> it never fulfilled you from the start <eos> it wont take long to mend a broken heart <eos> cause you deserve more than that <eos> you deserve more than that <eos> you deserve more than that give me another glass of spirit <eos> let it slowly drown my soul <eos> it doesnt matter what is in it <eos> as long as my problems go <eos> cause we cant wait around till morning <eos> for the bar is sure to close <eos> and well exaggerate the impact <eos> that its been leaving on my steady cl <eos> but the warmth in my throat <eos> may not be as permanent as i once feared <eos> and the shadows on the stool <eos> arent as shy as they appear <eos> if im a drunk then please ignore me <eos> i wasnt there when times were bad <eos> you thought i never once adored my coldest feet <eos> and since ignored the only girl i ever truly had <eos> so take your coat and go <eos> youll need it when its colder <eos> or stay with me tonight <eos> and watch me waste my only chance <eos> to hold her <eos> its the only way to learn about mistakes youve made <eos> at am <eos> cause she has poise she has thunder <eos> she speaks a love thats never shown <eos> and im not sure that shell remember <eos> those many nights she left me here alone <eos> cause im a drunk and i deserved it <eos> there were more than subtle signs <eos> theres no reflection in the mirror <eos> what i once believed was here <eos> its getting clear i struggle with my mind <eos> so take your coat and go <eos> youll need it when its colder <eos> or stay with me tonight <eos> and watch me waste my only chance <eos> to hold her <eos> its the only way <eos> to learn about mistakes youve made <eos> at am <eos> give me another glass of spirit <eos> let it slowly drown my soul <eos> it doesnt matter what is in it <eos> as long as my problems go <eos> as long as my problems go time is of the essence <eos> and the essence is of you <eos> i have never know someone who does thing like you do <eos> you take the time to laugh it up you call things as they are <eos> you are my you are my tiny shiny star <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh to place where i become become one two three four five <eos> i feel so aliveyeah <eos> one two three four five <eos> i feel so i feel so aliveyeah <eos> simple times in a simple place have never felt so good <eos> until we met i always felt a bit misunderstood <eos> you take the time to listen close you part the cloudy skies <eos> cause even the rain cant help but fall for your big baby blue eyes <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh to a place where i become become one two three four five <eos> i feel so aliveyeah <eos> one two three four five <eos> i feel so i feel so alive <eos> one is for the number of days it took for me to fall <eos> two is when i knew you were one to play along <eos> three we started see how deep we could be if we were to trust that <eos> four our love could handle anything that came to us and that <eos> five in the morning we stop we listen we talk we kiss and we stare cant believe were <eos> there <eos> time is of the essence and the essence of you <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh to a place where i become become <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh <eos> take me awayoh to a place where i become we become one im coming to terms with the fact that im not as strong as i lead on <eos> and im coming to terms with the fact that im wrong sometimes <eos> and as hard as it is for me to be the person that no body wants to see <eos> i was crawling in my skin <eos> and hiding in that shell <eos> and i was dying in my skin <eos> like laying down in hell <eos> but now im free <eos> oh now im free yeah woah <eos> oh now im hey hey hey <eos> dont u walk away while i am talking to you <eos> i still have more to say im only halfway through to you <eos> to you <eos> and im coming to terms that true human connections is hard to come by <eos> im coming to terms with the fact that its ok to feel that its ok to cry <eos> and those are the reasons why <eos> im not crawling in my skin <eos> or hiding in that shell <eos> and im not dying in my skin <eos> or laying down in hell <eos> yeah now im free <eos> oh now im free yeah yeah woah <eos> oh now im oh oh oh <eos> i want you to know it hasnt been so easy <eos> learning to let go of your perception of me <eos> your perception <eos> but im coming to terms with the fact that in life i am bound to have self doubts <eos> im coming to terms with the fact that my road is not already mapped out <eos> and as easy as it would be to take the picture you created and turn it into me until i suffocated <eos> i would be i would be <eos> crawling in my skin <eos> and hiding in that shell <eos> i would be dying in my skin <eos> like laying down in hell <eos> but now im free <eos> yeah now im free oh now im free oh oh oh oh some people say talk is cheap <eos> oh but have say that i disagree <eos> cuz sometimes my words mean more than anything <eos> cuz i mean wat i say and i say what i mean <eos> but percent of the population cant say that much <eos> no percent of the population cant say that much <eos> some people lie more than they tell the truth <eos> they are a house with no location foundation or root <eos> and at least they think theyve got walls but even those topple over in the wind <eos> its like a paradox if you lose maybe you were tryin too hard to win <eos> but percent of the population is doing that <eos> but percent of the population is doing that <eos> eliminate the veils in your eyes <eos> your wasted band aids cover lies <eos> make up and face hair may hide the surface <eos> but when its all gone will you know your purpose <eos> some ppl try to blend in with the group <eos> i bet u some ppl practice actin just like you <eos> and if youve ever heard of the girl who died from crying too much wolf <eos> im sure that i dont have to tell you she would take it all back if she could <eos> but percent of the population will be saying that <eos> oh percent of the population will be saying that <eos> cuz percent of the population will be saying that <eos> percent of the population will be saying that i will run my ass into the woods if youll follow <eos> and i will sing for you my dreams about tomorrow <eos> dont you know i dont you know i dont you know i will <eos> i will <eos> i will do things i never thought i would do but always kinda wanted to i will move slowly show me everything you want me to do <eos> cause dont you know i dont you know i dont you know i will <eos> i will <eos> oh hold me until i wake up inside of the picture that ive been imagining <eos> i am painting love a portrait and i can see it like its happening <eos> so when oh when will i be there when oh when will i be there <eos> i am right here right now right here <eos> i am right here right now <eos> i am right here right now right here <eos> i am right here right now <eos> i am right here right now right here <eos> i am right here right now <eos> i am right here right now right here <eos> i am right here right now <eos> i am right here right now right here <eos> i am right here right now <eos> so i will arrive for my own life when i am damn well ready <eos> and i know my mind likes to take the light and turn it around and make it heavy <eos> oh but dont you know i dont you know i dont you know i will i will <eos> i will oh whoa <eos> oh whoa <eos> oh whoa <eos> i guess you notice i guess you care <eos> about the way iflip my

we never even bothered to ask <eos> who are we or who we should be <eos> we just exsisted with no resistance <eos> we were superheroes then <eos> but times have changed <eos> and wars are raging <eos> underneath our skin <eos> were dodging bullets and <eos> holding ground <eos> pushing pulling and weighing down <eos> what happened to that cape i used to wear <eos> is it out there <eos> is it out there <eos> and if you find it somewhere inside of me <eos> help me find it because i should be flying <eos> i wanna be a superhero again <eos> and finish this war under my skin <eos> oh but history has shown us <eos> that when times are gettin hard <eos> its time for us to grow and see exactly who we are <eos> the morning after the storm <eos> is always brighter than the rest <eos> right <eos> especially when you know you past your test <eos> but the tests are only standerized <eos> in little public schools <eos> were theyve given you all the answers <eos> and prepared you with the rules <eos> i dont think life on earth is set up <eos> quite the same <eos> its every man out for himself <eos> until we make things change <eos> can we make things change <eos> so give me one thing <eos> something please <eos> just a glimmer of hope <eos> im on my knees <eos> i need to know that im not <eos> that im not crazy <eos> and if i am <eos> then tell me now so i can <eos> tie my cape to my straight jacket <eos> and bow out <eos> cause i am not about to go down this way <eos> no not the superhero <eos> today <eos> i guess im not the superhero <eos> today hã¦rra <eos> hã¡tt ã©g lyfti huga

here <eos> you are my little furnace <eos> you are my favorite song and <eos> were dancing in public <eos> to the sounds of our town <eos> to the traffic rolling down the i <eos> i would rather be wine drunk <eos> than sober and clear <eos> when were together <eos> in weather so dear and <eos> the ending so near and <eos> all i want is right here salt and sugar sustains through the freeze your phone calls never bring me out of thick dreams i cant be reasonable say come here alone pull the phone from the outlet and collapse in the hall a hell of a ride if you seize it it wont be the same if you leave it sleep with your door ajar for the sound of any person or car i slept on the sofa bed i never will again i crept round the living room to tire my limbs she hated that her balcony that i could never be ok when it broke us forever it all resembled tv you know where youll go when you leave here you look tired with the keys in your hand afraid you might have missed her call ashamed that you missed her at all its not over by any means but you cant do anything i know it feels like shunning family but some bridges are worth burning let i cash advances and jennys back on campus <eos> i cant believe that its september <eos> said jenny whats the story all the chicks in her sorority <eos> asked her how she spent the summer <eos> said i interned at some law firm i got a little sunburned <eos> i saw some raver kid get murdered <eos> i met a guy and this guy i met he got me high <eos> and the drum and bass sounds a lot like rollin thunder <eos> and the blue looks beautiful as it tops off the torch <eos> you dont have to go inside to buy you can buy it off the porch <eos> twentyseven lovers in the back half of the summer <eos> i know you think thats way too many <eos> but the x makes me feel sexy and the sex makes me feel empty <eos> the alcohol destroys me <eos> and i did it in a disco with some guy from san francisco <eos> who looked a lot like roger daltry <eos> and the night of all that bloodshed i was kissin on some crackhead <eos> who said he knew about a party he keeps it in his mouth in those crazy chipmunk cheeks <eos> i gave him fifty and he kissed me spit a little treat between my teeth <eos> i think were starting to peak <eos> woke up at some hedonistic rodeo <eos> with cowboys kissing cowboys trading magazines for videos <eos> god bless the radio all that fine fine music without all the messed up musicians <eos> and dwights a magician he gets sensible people makin terrible decisions <eos> her name was sally but they all called her sal mineo <eos> she was lit up like an arson but she burned out like arsenio <eos> her name was sandy but they all called her san antonio <eos> she cant remember where she slept last night but she wont forget the alamo <eos> sandy dont forget our alibi overly enthused easily confused do you really even have to ask why you feel so why you feel so used common obligations common complications she said to me in the dark that it was just like suicide and that you really dont want to die but youve said it so many times like a musical trend you see it as a phase predictable film with a forgettable end why does boy meet girl leave me feeling ripped off the police have been tipped off following a trail of denial theyve all got my file saying something you say keep your chin up here we are in the open air the glow of our godless season were fighting for no reason we both want the same things and its just like suicide i really dont want to die but weve been through this so many times its just like suicide i really dont want to die but the choice aint as if i needed any more reason <eos> to exorcise these demons <eos> im telling you this hell is <eos> more than i can handle even now <eos> so do you have an opinion sweetness <eos> how we can better feed this urge <eos> can we merge with utter urgency <eos> in secrecy i see that were both hurt <eos> call me now <eos> i have this picture here <eos>

going to kick the curse <eos> but talking about it now is only making it worse <eos> one day <eos> one day <eos> can i count on a change <eos> a crisis of faith to come and save me <eos> when the work isnt done the calluses come what what then <eos> trying to chase perpetual grace but there isnt a trace <eos> when my head lands heavy on the pillow <eos> wake up and i start again <eos> how long do you have to hammer the nail <eos> how long do you have to hammer the nail <eos> before you finally figure out that youve been building a jail <eos> how long <eos> how long <eos> all the liquor in town tried to turn it around <eos> feeling lucky <eos> but the blistering sun the tip of my tongue <eos> feeling small <eos> then the shadow was saved <eos> the power betrayed <eos> im only getting further at the end of the day <eos> is there a difference looking over that wall <eos> how long do you have to hammer the nail <eos> how long do you have to hammer the nail <eos> how long how long <eos> do

theres a danger of overthinking <eos> it was everybody getting tired of drinking <eos> every night <eos> there was a little left to believe in <eos> which is how i really knew i should be leaving <eos> i should be leaving <eos> now <eos> i should be leaving <eos> we were clever then <eos> we talked forever then <eos> and the night of our invention it would never end <eos> there was a parting <eos> and there was sorrow <eos> it was impossible to picture it tomorrow <eos> it was necessity <eos> and it was instinct <eos> and the pattern underneath <eos> it kept repeating <eos> kept repeating <eos> kept repeating <eos> its just how i really knew i should be leaving <eos> i should be leaving <eos> now <eos> i should be leaving <eos> oh and it was everything <eos> oh and it was just a way to keep from waking up <eos> hello <eos> which is why i had to go <eos> which is why i should be leaving <eos> which is why i had to go <eos> am i delibering <eos> am i delivering <eos> am i offering the blanket <eos> and youre shivering <eos> is it a play without the passion <eos> is it the endless repetition of inaction <eos> is this a christening <eos> or theres a crisis <eos> we can get together then <eos> and say how nice it is <eos> is it torment <eos> that depends <eos> which is how a really knew i should be leaving <eos> i should be leaving <eos> now <eos> i should be leaving <eos> oh and it was everything <eos> oh and it was just a way to keep from waking up <eos> hello <eos> which is why i had to go <eos> which is why i should be leaving <eos> which is why i had to go <eos> what do

no way to appease all the warring factions <eos> no sword to fall upon <eos> nothing will not fall apart <eos> no nothing has ever seemed clear <eos> and i know it hasnt been our best year <eos> maybe

you now telling you where to go <eos> the sky and the plow has erased all your tracks in the snow <eos> nothing and nowhere and no one is not a pretender <eos> but remember <eos> no surrender <eos> no breaking the news <eos> no changing the weather <eos> no use trying to keep it together <eos> no one is telling you you shouldnt feel lonely tonight <eos> no answer for the doctor <eos> not not the one that you were after <eos> every test could be wrong then again <eos> every test could be right <eos> no way to be certain <eos> there is no one behind the curtain <eos> and clicking your heels no matter how good it feels <eos> it wont bring you back home <eos> no one is guiding you now telling you where to go <eos> the sky and the plow has erased all your tracks in the snow <eos> nothing and nowhere and no one is not a pretender <eos> but remember <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender <eos> no surrender summer

phone number <eos> and six states away <eos> i dialed and found you home <eos> your voice comes back <eos> like the day comes back <eos> from a night of dreams <eos> youre getting married <eos> and youre crazy about her <eos> you really miss me <eos> i know exactly what you mean <eos> oh thats so nice to hear <eos> youve planted <eos> all your roots down there <eos> im still wandering <eos> like the fruit fallen from the tree <eos> is she nice to you not like me <eos> like the wife she was raised to be <eos> i remember peeling <eos> off your clothes <eos> to find your body <eos> a layer of my favorite cake <eos> i remember blowing <eos> mad cash on you <eos> i was living like i had it <eos> loving like we had it too <eos> i miss those night together <eos> on your futon on the floor <eos> and your drives to carolina <eos> and pink floyd <eos> our common core <eos> and your breath <eos> between my shoulders <eos> and your car <eos> that took me miles <eos> across state lines <eos> and space and time <eos> i think ill step outside now <eos> catch a slice of sunlight <eos> through the rain <eos> ill try and feel the sunset <eos> hiding in the clouds <eos> here your poems <eos> still warm me <eos> when memory drains <eos> did i mention that i miss you <eos> and i love you sometimes <eos> not in that famous <eos> starcrossed way <eos> in that love with a limit way <eos> isnt it nice <eos> i still dont know <eos> what you do for money <eos> isnt it nice only your art <eos> came up in conversation <eos> isnt that nice <eos> on a rainy brooklyn <eos> morning i dialed and <eos> found you home drag king bar <eos> well i was bored with the lesbian scene <eos> i told myself i gotta find another thing <eos> so i strapped on my boots <eos> and i walked down the street <eos> and i rolled right in to the local dkb <eos> drag king bar that is <eos> when i walked in at quarter to eight <eos> well i thought that i might be straight <eos> at the drag kind bar last night <eos> its unlike me to look at boys <eos> when the girls are packing toys <eos> i can dig that scene all right <eos> then across the bar <eos> he played the air guitar <eos> and mouthed those words real sexy <eos> it was then that i surely knew <eos> that this one would be a two <eos> if i played my cards just right <eos> well i was drunk and i was bored <eos> and he was cute so i was lured <eos> at the drag king bar last night <eos> where all the boys are really girls <eos> and the fags whip out their pearls <eos> at the drag king bar last night <eos> then at a quarter to ten <eos> he scoped me again <eos> and drank his beer so sexy <eos> it was then that i surely knew <eos> that this one would be a two <eos> by the end of the night tonight <eos> then he used the line that works everytime <eos> he said hey is this seat taken <eos> i said no he said lets go <eos> i said where i dont care <eos> im a scorpio <eos> take me home right now <eos> then at a quarter to twelve <eos> as i began to delve <eos> into that drag king last night <eos> well my thoughts were so strange <eos> boy my luck sure had changed <eos> i was queen to the king last night angels we have heard are high <eos> smoking joints up in the sky <eos> delusions are floating by <eos> paranoias running wild <eos> ganja <eos> in excess aint dangerous <eos> angels we have heard are high <eos> smoking doobies in the sky <eos> smoked me out on sunday night <eos> now church really does feel right <eos> ganja <eos> in excess aint dangerous <eos> angels smoked me out last night <eos> after getting jesus high <eos> he says ganja makes you strong <eos> i say great pass me the bong <eos> ganja <eos> in excess aint dangerous <eos> the church social was real fun <eos> munching down sinamon buns <eos> boy those catholics are uptight <eos> glad i took this flight tonight <eos> ganja <eos> in excess aint dangerous <eos> mother mary was naive <eos> baked a cake with josephs weed <eos> she passed out then he came in <eos> immaculate conception <eos> ganja <eos> in excess aint dangerous the blind space of low clouds <eos> the breeze that moves them <eos> over my foreheadthird eye <eos> the moon that hangs <eos> half and orange <eos> your letter sits by my bed <eos> rode all the way <eos> tidetwisted from china <eos> heavy in love <eos> your words spring toward <eos> my dreaming dreary brain <eos> i suspend your picture <eos> hands length from my heart <eos> remind me to recycle <eos> change my underwear <eos> and take in my bicycle <eos> for all of its energies <eos> lifes lazy in love <eos> the in and out is active <eos> your letter sticks <eos> to never be resurrected <eos> my hands are glue <eos> the sink is the fun <eos> my hands are glue do do not not fear <eos> what pushes you over the line <eos> evolution never stops <eos> a revolution always costs <eos> it all comes out <eos> in a matter of time dont do crystal <eos> dont do boys <eos> dont do boys <eos> who do crystal <eos> dont

of my own aaron and maria ran <eos> from the northwest coast to the city and <eos> now they reside out in brooklyn heights <eos> where the rich kids hide and the years go by <eos> aaron writes but they both survive <eos> cause maria waits on library lines <eos> and aaron sighs "if the tvs right <eos> you put your hat on tight or catch a death outside" <eos> were living off some modest trust <eos> from daddy fore his oil went bust <eos> and loving you is just enough <eos> cause no one gives a fuck about us <eos> understand its the way i am <eos> when we argue and break the hearts we have <eos> we only fight cause you love me right <eos> and when we lay at night i feel a kick inside <eos> were living off some modest trust <eos> from daddy fore his oil went bust <eos> and loving you is just enough <eos> cause no one gives a fuck about us burned out like all <eos> cathie candles <eos> marked up with the <eos> choir vandals <eos> reading "destroy destroy destroy" <eos> twospeed cycle <eos> streamered handles <eos> evenings with the <eos> roman scandals <eos> i just want to be someone you know i watch the sun come up while youre sleeping it off <eos> when you go out for your news and curse your smokers cough <eos> i bring you bills to pay <eos> and letters from the state <eos> then you go inside and i walk away <eos> im the postman <eos> im the postman <eos> and i walk you street for hours like some kind of jerk <eos> with my grey clip tie and my pressed blue shirt <eos> and when you leave for work <eos> i think youre turning to flirt <eos> but youre turning away and it always hurts <eos> im the postman <eos> im the postman <eos> i know why you stare east its where your mans run off <eos> and i know why your trash bin is brimming with his art <eos> cause when he was abroad <eos> i read his last postcard <eos> he met some brit named cass and it broke your heart <eos> im the postman <eos> im the postman there was no doubt <eos> the moment was savored <eos> with or without <eos> your dads coda speaking out of anger <eos> when word got out <eos> the kid was in danger <eos> then we all went south <eos> for skirting the chains of labor <eos> for the kindness of strangers <eos> so we all got out <eos> for the kindness of strangers <eos> and we just walked out <eos> the kid was leaning on a leg to favor <eos> but there was no doubt <eos> the kid was in danger <eos> cause she was cast out <eos> but turned a corner and her dad forgave her <eos> for the kindness of strangers sending me a postcard from the sands <eos> a photograph and how youre doing <eos> you write the words in ink and cursive and <eos> i follow along with my fingers and pretend <eos> theyll follow you when you leave <eos> only if they want you <eos> around the world when you leave <eos> but only if they want you <eos> sending me a postcard from the japan <eos> a photograph and how youre doing <eos> you write the words in ink and cursive and <eos> i follow along with my fingers and pretend <eos> theyll follow you when you leave <eos> only if they want you <eos> around the world when you leave <eos> but only if they want you <eos> theyll follow you when you leave <eos> only if they want you <eos> only if they want you <eos> only if they want you you are a book for me to read <eos> familiar lines that i read on and on <eos> you are a film for me to see <eos> a string of frames that just goes on and on and on <eos> and off the places that ive been <eos> familiar faces that go on and on <eos> you are a song for me to sing <eos> a string of verses that goes on and on and on worlds on end <eos> seen through <eos> a rocket window screen <eos> millions left to roam <eos> engines burn <eos> beautiful and bright <eos> always bring me home <eos> if galaxies <eos> are places youve <eos> never been too far <eos> suns will fade <eos> both blind and lead the way <eos> home where you are <eos> away away <eos> away away <eos> the receiver <eos> in my rocket ship <eos> always stays in tune <eos> to the right waveband <eos> in galaxies unknown <eos> further suns in bloom keep me like a key <eos> worn around your neck <eos> lucky like a charm <eos> and closest to your heart <eos> keep me like a jewel <eos> curled around your finger <eos> and hold me in your hand <eos> im lit up like a candle the only one oh will you <eos> pretend like you want me <eos> and make you think <eos> like i know how it feels <eos> could i be so cruel <eos> yeah well love dont come easy <eos> well i love you when you do <eos> i made it through <eos> the days that could end us <eos> and oh will you <eos> let me know how it feels <eos> and speak of love so true <eos> oh well i know you dont mean it <eos> still i love you when you do <eos> and you know <eos> there is nothing worth

questions <eos> its a pointless enterprise <eos> you ask and ill only tell you what i think you want to hear <eos> oh mind the whitest lies <eos> cause the truth <eos> well its for students for philosophy <eos> and faith is for losers like us <eos> and secrets are for people who intend to get away with being in the wrong <eos> so dont you breath a word <eos> but save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> for the talking all night oh <eos> save you breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> save your breath <eos> will you listen to their bleeding hearts <eos> pretend to show concern <eos> and so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings <eos> oh what have we become <eos> will you hop a train to anywhere <eos> it sure aint no place like home <eos> where there are no strangers <eos> only people you dont wanna know <eos> but before the crying out loud <eos> just save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> for the talking all night oh <eos> save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud oh <eos> save your breath <eos> save your breath <eos> so meet me by the station <eos> and bring a change of heart <eos> and smile away the old country as we watch it disappear <eos> and pull these years apart <eos> and scatter from the window <eos> to settle on the fields <eos> and tell yourself a hundred times that forever starts today <eos> and think how good it feels <eos> to save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> for the talking all night oh <eos> save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> save your breath <eos> to save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud again <eos> save your breath <eos> for the talking all night oh <eos> save your breath <eos> for the laughing aloud oh <eos> save your breath <eos> save oh <eos> save your breath <eos> dont waste your breath on treading water anymore <eos> save your breath <eos> there must be something you consider to be worth fighting for <eos> save your breath <eos> waste your breath on running circles round and round and round <eos> save your breath <eos> and talking about it when it cannot get you down <eos> save your breath <eos> nobody wants that much we just want more <eos> save your breath <eos> dont waste your breath on treading water anymore <eos> save your breath <eos> dont waste your breath on running circles round and round and round and round <eos> save your breath <eos> save your breath clouds on the moon <eos> it was a hollywood sky <eos> i sat on the wall til your parents drove by <eos> and i walked to you door <eos> and remember how you smiled <eos> well that was a long time ago <eos> your fault or mine <eos> its such a tough one to call <eos> do you one day look up to see your innocence fall <eos> from a twelve story window to the concrete below <eos> it was all such a long time ago <eos> now your path and mine <eos> they never seem to converge <eos> and now sat here in godknowswhere with a mouthful of words <eos> well they just sound like noises <eos> if you say them enough <eos> it was all such a long time ago <eos> now was it though <eos> in some underground saloon <eos> where you can always get a drink <eos> theres a girl by the cigarette machine <eos> and i think ill strike up a conversation <eos> but i wouldnt know how <eos> doesnt seem such a good idea now <eos> with the clouds on the moon <eos> another hollywood sky <eos> its time i dragged myself home and to wonder just why <eos> i still think of you know <eos> only as you were then <eos> it was all such a long time ago <eos> now was it though sweet dreams all met with derision <eos> this train it was armed for collision <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> clap your hands in the sparkle and glitter <eos> shake your heads at the twisted and bitter <eos> oh they dont know how lucky they are <eos> foot down for the alienation <eos> look on as your love its gets lost in translation <eos> to a language that nobody understands <eos> there are smiles as they erode and corrupt you <eos> of the great expectations you could never live up to <eos> we are lost we are lost we are lost <eos> get you coat cause the righteous are leaving <eos> cause they cant work out what the hell to believe in <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> no abandon no heartfelt desire <eos> no love could be worth getting fired <eos> for real its surreal its so real <eos> so paint over the cracks and then cover <eos> what you thought was the worst ever pain with another <eos> and the first one it always comes free <eos> how they love you so cold and so vicious <eos> with friends like these well who needs politicians <eos> the first one its always comes free <eos> they tell you heroin takes like ice cream <eos> clever men know all that and all this <eos> and they will talk and they talk and the dont fucking listen <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> its no life but god its a living <eos> come on jesus christ come back all is forgiven <eos> we are lost we are lost we are lost <eos> have no fear of the state of the nation <eos> let the facts have no bearing on public relations <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> what a model of christian behavior <eos> preach on with the message of "go fuck thy neighbor" <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> its a shame its a shame <eos> watch your step by the crowd of fanatics <eos> while they kill in the name of applied mathematics <eos> hate the system even though you invented it <eos> go kill your brothers and claim self defense of it <eos> picking up all the secrets and tricks to being <eos> one of the guys whom the shit never sticks to <eos> take you seats for the final calamity <eos> dont you look serious hell what can the matter be <eos> another day and the rots getting faster <eos> and all the machines started killing the master <eos> its a shame its a shame its a shame <eos> its a shame its a shame all this time <eos> and all is fine <eos> oh call me paranoid <eos> but i think somethings

swim until youre free <eos> i will remember your face <eos> cause i am still in love with that place <eos> but when the stars are the only things we share <eos> will you be there <eos> money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting <eos> for that cold long promise to appear <eos> people in the churches started singing above their hands <eos> they say "my god is a good god and he cares" <eos> i will remember your face <eos> cause i am still in love with that place <eos> when the stars are the only things we share <eos> will you be there if you crash your car into <eos> your best friends house <eos> would you be quiet as <eos> words come out of their mouth <eos> stop dont do it <eos> i have been waiting for it <eos> stop i knew it would come <eos> if you find a god next to <eos> your girlfriends bed <eos> would it be hard to <eos> sort out your spinning head <eos> stop dont say that dear <eos> that you wanted him here <eos> stop dont give him a clear <eos> take a picture of them <eos> take a picture of them <eos> if you are afraid dont be <eos> i have the whole thing planned <eos> well start in the ocean baby <eos> and when we find the land <eos> we will be thankful to <eos> all of our friends <eos> that they didnt leave us <eos> as we got to the end <eos> take a picture of them <eos> take a picture of them <eos> take a picture of them <eos> take a picture of them <eos> if you find your faith in <eos> your parents god <eos> dont be so quick to <eos> point out the flaws in it <eos> youve been around and youve seen <eos> the way that things work <eos> but you need a compass to <eos> get around your house i left this earth today <eos> didnt look back at my terrain <eos> sold my possessions at sea <eos> followed the fortune of destiny <eos> i knelt before the king <eos> stared with wonder at what life may bring <eos> and filled with confidence <eos> i set upon my close legend <eos> oh devine soldier life taker of this land <eos> oh devine soldier life taker will command <eos> so do as you will <eos> i travelled far and wide <eos> a journey made with no compromise <eos> and climbing port to peak i took the passage of which you speak <eos> i lay on sheets of gold <eos> i stared at eyes that hold this world <eos> and with each prophesy <eos> i took my leap my leap to be down the road and on the righthand side <eos> theres a place i

<eos> so ive gotten used to coffee sweats <eos> still getting used to road regrets <eos> and hell i took you up on all your threats to leave <eos> its a shame <eos> its a crying shame <eos> thems the breaks <eos> and aint it always the way <eos> that takes you back to from where it is you came <eos> and robbie likes his country tunes <eos> its never been the lens that i see through <eos> but i guess driving for a week or two <eos> puts words in your mouth <eos> so find dodge and then get out of it <eos> its about as country as i get <eos> so you aint living til youre living it <eos> not dead til you die <eos> but watch out for the paraphrase <eos> cause they will crown you and they will take your legs <eos> see the cost is more than what you get paid <eos> but do it anyway <eos> its a shame <eos> its a crying shame <eos> thems the breaks <eos> and aint it always the way <eos> it takes you back to from where it is you came <eos> its a shame <eos> its a crying shame <eos> thems the breaks <eos> and aint it always the way <eos> it takes you back to from where it is you came downtown vancouver <eos> digging through your bag <eos> ripping out the pages <eos> of the local music mag <eos> you missed the show last summer <eos> but now youve got your chance <eos> theyre playing at the railway <eos> with another emo band <eos> im ambitious when giving up <eos> never thinking clear enough <eos> but were not elvis anymore <eos> were not frankie in his wild years <eos> were not tinas glorious comeback <eos> were not us were not us <eos> sold my soul to the devil <eos> for nice penmanship <eos> and now i write real pretty <eos> but im starting to regret it <eos> if all of this was easy <eos> it wouldnt matter how it ends <eos> im ambitious when giving up <eos> never thinking clear enough <eos> but were not elvis anymore <eos> were not frankie in his wild years <eos> were not tinas glorious comeback <eos> were not us were not us <eos> were not us anymore <eos> were not us <eos> were not us anymore <eos> were not us <eos> were not us you decide to be alone <eos> and hell its cold enough to hibernate <eos> so let it drift into the snow <eos> its where she chooses how to operate <eos> might be time to pack her in <eos> set the sails and just get hauled away <eos> maybe east or something <eos> west was overrated anyway <eos> the storms coming down <eos> these old walls are wearing thin <eos> theres an ache to this town <eos> and somethings gotta give <eos> if were digging for gold <eos> and coming up dry <eos> just a matter of time <eos> just a matter of time oh and on the screen my love and trust is making out with other guys <eos> and i drank not enough to make me drunk and just enough to make me tired <eos> and its too easy to be awful to the ones you need the most <eos> so in the end all i hope is that they know <eos> ask the bottom from the top and they will tell you that its lonely too <eos> so find a gun and spin the wheel and try to figure which god youll choose <eos> its too easy to be angry at the ones that you dont know <eos> so dont ask questions dont ask directions just go <eos> so paint your pickets white and beat your wife just dont forget to shut the blinds <eos> if you can keep your neighbours in the dark then surely god can close her eyes <eos> cause its too easy to be righteous when you eat what youve been fed <eos> some people dont question what theyve read <eos> some people should <eos> some people <eos> some people <eos> so what do you do what do you do when you go home <eos> now what do you do what do you do when you go home <eos> now what do you do what do you do when you go home <eos> now what do you do what do you do when you go home <eos> now what do you do what do you do when you go home <eos> now what do you do what do you do when you go home we are young <eos> we have years ahead maybe <eos> we might fall in love <eos> fall apart <eos> fall apart <eos> before it ends <eos> well we should try to start <eos> so ill go but im telling you i dont wanna go <eos> could be stuck here and happy <eos> so theres a puzzle i work on endlessly <eos> and ive got the sides and all the corners <eos> but theres a space <eos> yeah theres a space <eos> lost some pieces i cant replace <eos> so ill be but im telling you i dont wanna be <eos> just a wasted puzzle piece <eos> we are old <eos> and our son took the dog away <eos> and fair enough guess were tired all the time <eos> all the time <eos> and you know dogs they need ample time outside <eos> so ill stay but im telling you i dont i dont wanna stay <eos> so ill brace myself against the wall and hope to god that i dont fall <eos> my bones are worn my hip wont hold <eos> i used to be so young how did i get so old <eos> wont you take my cane and hold my hand <eos> youre holding onto all i have <eos> just a basket full of memories <eos> and i am losing more each day it seems <eos> but if i can make it to the street <eos> ill steal a car or a bike whatever there is to steal <eos> and it might get cold i just dont care <eos> im going til im getting there <eos> ill ride my steed all through this town <eos> til i have looked and i have found <eos> your peaceful memory <eos> wont you return to me <eos> wont you return to me she says the joys of life are lost among the living <eos> so i guess all those souvenirs are for her health <eos> she gives me quarters for the phone <eos> and every time i feel alone i go broke <eos> yeah i go broke <eos> she says if youre not here at least make sure you miss me <eos> so when i miss her i make sure to let her know <eos> its the least that i could do <eos> and sure i guess i like it too <eos> im mr charming without the charming <eos> i can hear the eyebrows raise when i start singing <eos> cause the songs i sing are all about myself <eos> you can read me like a book <eos> im not as clever as i look <eos> ive got a sneaky kind of selfish <eos> that i keep upon the shelf <eos> with jars of doublesided comments <eos> for people whove done nothing wrong <eos> preparing for the lights <eos> and always practicing my shananas <eos> i will stand right next to giants <eos> and roar aside the lions <eos> wondering how is it so easy <eos> for leaves amid the breeze to blow <eos> from hometowns all around us <eos> to hometowns where nobody lives <eos> just cities full of people <eos> people making people making people <eos> for the masses <eos> people we wont ever know <eos> she says the point of this is not to date the future <eos> so just focus on the task at hand <eos> try to break up with your pride <eos> and start to flirt with satisfied turn the bars into cars <eos> and wait for the lights to change <eos> and take shape of people we used to know <eos> til they grow less fond of knowing <eos> and we can ride in the night <eos> and discard all the facts on our backs <eos> remembering the thoughts we thought <eos> since we got over our parents <eos> and if we go where we go <eos> and dont tell anyone where were from <eos> we can cut and paste the stars to our hearts <eos> and understand their language <eos> and we wont spit with our mouths <eos> or draw lines in the dirt with our heels <eos> and every single day well just wait <eos> and hope to see the next one <eos> if we go down too easy my dear <eos> well still be the heart of envy of all our friends and peers <eos> so i get home to my home <eos> the thoughts are in my head <eos> and my bed is full of things i left <eos> when i left her here <eos> and the light through the blinds <eos> and through the windowpane in the lane <eos> where the fire is getting cold <eos> for they have burned all of their belongings <eos> and up the stairs theres a pair <eos> who like to be made sure <eos> that they were everything they are <eos> for they are sadly mistaken <eos> now i forget how we met <eos> those days have all passed <eos> now the cast is filing to the stage <eos> in a rage and taking their places <eos> if we go down too easy my dear <eos> well still be the heart of envy of all our peers and friends my dear <eos> to them well be hasbeens <eos> to them be rouge waves <eos> to them be lost trains <eos> just posers posing <eos> well leat with our eyes <eos> and weep our goodbyes <eos> and if thats what it takes <eos> well both drink the koolaid again <eos> til weve forgotten where our hearts have been <eos> til weve forgotten where our hearts have been <eos> til we forget just where our hearts have been i dont want to be a pioneer <eos> a singer sings a sad song when hes sad <eos> but

was it forth giving all i gave <eos> in the wake of all the worry <eos> through the pain i must be learning <eos> im afraid ive seen the light <eos> and im only wasting time on something that never was <eos> will never be innocent all because <eos> im on a stepping stone <eos> im on a stepping stone ooh ooh ooh ooh x <eos> like a bird i used to fly <eos> but the wind is a wild one <eos> lately ive built a wall and its hard to trust at all <eos> many moons will come to pass <eos> and a love thats built to last will find its way to me <eos> now im free to be <eos> on a stepping stone <eos> im on a stepping stone ooh ooh ooh ooh x <eos> on and on i run when all is said and done ooh ooh ooh ooh x <eos> instrumental <eos> aba lop hmm ap ah dum x ooh oh oh ooh oh oh oh x x <eos> on a stepping stone <eos> im on a stepping stone ooh ooh ooh ooh x <eos> on and on i run when all is said and done ooh ooh ooh ooh x <eos> oh oh oh oh x who am i addressing now <eos> it seems as though im only ever talking to myself <eos> the mirrors there but i dont see my face anywhere <eos> no matter how straight i stare <eos> even when theres nothing there <eos> still talking like its everywhere <eos> im just stuck on everything <eos> everything that i let get to me <eos> its controllable but <eos> it just slips and rolls <eos> all over these fingers <eos> and these clothes <eos> until its stains <eos> become the new plain <eos> and not even the rain <eos> can make it change <eos> what should have been an itch <eos> became a rash <eos> im just living in whatever hit me last <eos> letting the blow to the floor <eos> keep me from moving anywhere <eos> or keep me from moving anymore <eos> just letting the blow to the floor <eos> keep me from moving anywhere and anymore <eos> painting a mural on myself <eos> not too smooth not too rough <eos> its the perfect landscape <eos> for what i cant let go of didnt i tell you in the beginning <eos> that with you i could make our lifes worth living <eos> i told you no i warned you of how much i cared <eos> that my love was a curse seldom shared <eos> if you i became invested <eos> i knew right then in the end id be bested <eos> for the problem was not of my heart <eos> it would never have been that part <eos> it was of your own <eos> i wished your love wouldnt have been but a loan <eos> it was not of my heart <eos> it was of your own <eos> yours was just a loan <eos> but thats okay <eos> because this has happened before <eos> and not much has changed <eos> its all the same <eos> its all the same <eos> not much has changed <eos> its all the same <eos> but il go <eos> home <eos> alone <eos> again <eos> and let the memories of you <eos> gnaw at my bones <eos> and then <eos> when im all but hollow <eos> and theres nothing left of me to follow <eos> i will try again <eos> i will try again <eos> when im all but hollow <eos> and theres nothing left of me to follow <eos> i will try again <eos> and when the memories of you <eos> have dissolved my bones <eos> my skin will no longer have a stable home <eos> and then my flesh will resemble my soul <eos> a shell hollow and all alone i still wear the bracelet <eos> the one you made and gave to me <eos> when you were inspired by us <eos> i still wear it to remember that time when you were inspired by me <eos> though those moments are gone <eos> and so are you <eos> somehow you will last <eos> somehow you will always be there <eos> not only as a memory but as a feeling <eos> and not only as a feeling but as a lesson <eos> learned or not i still wear it whether i should or not <eos> though the feeling left <eos> its still here <eos> and so is the feeling that built it <eos> just a remnant <eos> how what was once alive in you <eos> could produce such a treasure <eos> makes one wonder where did it go <eos> what storms couldnt it weather <eos> how love built my treasure <eos> i still wear it to remember <eos> and i wonder if ever <eos> if the love that built my treasure <eos> is still there <eos> or will it ever be there again will it ever <eos> the twines that held it together <eos> were tied knots that werent meant to last forever <eos> they came undone <eos> the twines that held us together <eos> were tied in knots that werent meant to last forever <eos> we came undone <eos> together we thought we would weather <eos> but your storm said never <eos> and together forever became undone <eos> it became undone forever want to be happy <eos> want to stop just existing <eos> want to find that air worth breathing <eos> just want to find that something <eos> that makes life worth living <eos> the current to liven the sails <eos> the hammer to pull out all these damn nails <eos> because nothing is worth it <eos> without something behind it <eos> a life without love isnt a life worth living <eos> lungs with no room for breathing <eos> but i still have time i think il keep on waiting <eos> maybe one day itll change <eos> maybe one day this hole wont become my grave <eos> but the plot is dug and theres a stone that bares a name <eos> it looks like mine but im too scared in my shame <eos> to read the inscription etched within its frame <eos> maybe someone someday will grow fond of me <eos> but you know <eos> thats not really something that i can see <eos> im almost to where im going <eos> and when im home <eos> il be finally free <eos> and maybe after everything il finally be able to get some sleep <eos> when i close my eyes <eos> and im no longer forced see <eos> i can forget about the day <eos> and everything that has to be <eos> and when i wake up in the morning <eos> maybe this time il like what i see <eos> maybe il enjoy what has to be <eos> il just have to wait and see <eos> and when i wake up in the morning <eos> maybe this time il like what i see <eos> maybe il enjoy what has to be trying to find a substance <eos> trying to find a meaning <eos> but everything is empty <eos> sometimes i wonder <eos> why i even try <eos> because everything i do <eos> just wont come out right <eos> it just wont come out right <eos> why oh why wont it come out right <eos> im still searching for the truth <eos> and its still hiding from me <eos> i thought i found it in you <eos> but my heart was lying my hands just cant seem to work <eos> i cant block the sun <eos> theres always that lift away that sifts its way through the cracks <eos> i cant pick anything up <eos> without it slipping from my grasp <eos> it just falls into the tall grass <eos> and i cant hold your hands in mine <eos> and i cant share your stare <eos> not at this time <eos> because my blood doesnt pump well enough <eos> just a heart not strong enough <eos> from the last time someone dropped mine <eos> finger clasps <eos> weary and weathered <eos> they can barely lock together heart cover your tracks <eos> the blood that you spill will wash what you lack <eos> soul sew up your wounds <eos> test out your engine give it some room <eos> mind pick up your pace <eos> capture the thoughts you always chase <eos> soul open your wings <eos> lift this cage higher than any dream <eos> cover your tracks <eos> sew up your wounds <eos> pick up your pace <eos> open your wings <eos> heart flesh out your webs <eos> the past that was tangled will unwrap and shed <eos> soul sing out your songs <eos> clear out your throat belt it out strong <eos> cover your tracks <eos> sew up your wounds <eos> pick up your pace <eos> open your wings <eos> cover your tracks <eos> cover your tracks how much longer till this safe is cracked <eos> my feet are cold and my hands are shaking bad <eos> how much longer till the cops arrive <eos> to point their guns to catch us in a crime <eos> and weã¢ââve tried our best to conceal the threat <eos> that in time the law will catch us where we sleep <eos> and weã¢ââve tried our best to conceal the threats <eos> that in time the law will see us to our knees <eos> how much longer till this engine starts <eos> my heart is racing like a cannon ball <eos> how much longer till we get away <eos> and drive our crime through a different state <eos> how much longer till this safe is cracked <eos> my feet are cold and my hands are shaking bad <eos> how much longer till our luck is dry <eos> till you point your gun and shoot me in the side <eos> and iã¢ââve tried my best to forget your threats <eos> that in time your bullet would find itã¢ââs way in me <eos> and iã¢ââll try my best to hold my breath <eos> in time the law will find me where i bleed dont hold yourself like that <eos> cause youll hurt your knees <eos> well i kissed your mouth and back <eos> but thats all i need <eos> dont build your world around <eos> volcanoes melt you down <eos> and what i am to you is not real <eos> what i am to you you do not need <eos> what i am to you is not what you mean to me <eos> you give me miles and miles of mountains <eos> and ill ask for the sea <eos> dont throw yourself like that <eos> in front of me <eos> i kissed your mouth your back <eos> is that all you need <eos> dont drag my love around <eos> volcanoes melt me down <eos> what i am to you is not real <eos> what i am to you you do not need <eos> what i am to you is not what you mean to me <eos> you give me miles and miles of mountains <eos> and ill ask when i was just a little boy <eos> i asked my father "how would it be <eos> would i be able to play in the trees <eos> cause theyre cutting down forrest <eos> and spreading diseases" <eos> and heres what he said to me <eos> "que sera sera <eos> whatever will be will be <eos> the futures not ours to see <eos> que sera sera <eos> what will be will be" <eos> when i grew up and fell in love <eos> i asked my sweetheart "what lies ahead <eos> will there be rainbows day after day <eos> will we become just another clich <eos> having it all yeah and thrown it away" <eos> heres what my seetheart said <eos> "que sera sera <eos> whatever will be will be <eos> the futures not ours to see <eos> que sera sera <eos> what will be will be" <eos> now i have children of my own <eos> they ask their father "what will we be <eos> will we be bitter filled with regret <eos> will we be choking on our own shit" <eos> i tell them tenderly <eos> "que sera sera <eos> whatever will be will be <eos> the futures not ours to see <eos> que sera sera <eos> "que sera sera <eos> whatever will be will be <eos> the futures not ours to see <eos> que sera sera <eos> "que sera sera <eos> whatever will be will be <eos> the futures not ours to see <eos> que sera sera <eos> what will be will be <eos> que sera sera" i need a piss <eos> wanna hate <eos> fuck it up <eos> come <eos> my love <eos> eat your meat <eos> keep your teeth <eos> run <eos> you lost me <eos> you cost me <eos> you thought me of me yeah

place where no one knows what we have done <eos> do you come <eos> together ever with him <eos> and is he dark enough <eos> enough to see your light <eos> and do you brush your teeth before you kiss <eos> do you miss my smell <eos> and is he bold enough to take you on <eos> do you feel like you belong <eos> and does he drive you wild <eos> or just mildly free <eos> what about me <eos> well you held me like a lover <eos> sweaty hands <eos> and my foot in the appropriate place <eos> we use cushions to cover happy glands <eos> in the mild issue of our disgrace <eos> our minds pressed and guarded <eos> while our flesh disregarded <eos> the lack of space for the lighthearted <eos> in the boon that beats our drum <eos> well i know i make you cry <eos> and i know sometimes you wanna die <eos> but do you really feel alive without me <eos> if so be free <eos> if not leave him for me <eos> before one of us has accidental babies <eos> for we are in love <eos> do you come <eos> together ever with him <eos> is he dark enough <eos> enough to see your light <eos> do you brush your teeth before you kiss <eos> do you miss my smell <eos> and is he bold enough to take you on <eos> do you

down <eos> some fret it forget it <eos> some ruin and some regret it <eos> i never meant to let you down <eos> we learn to wag and tuck our tails <eos> we learn to win and then to fail <eos> didnt we <eos> we learn that lovers love to sing <eos> and that losers love to cling <eos> didnt we <eos> am i the greatest bastard that you know <eos> when will we learn to let this go <eos> we fought so much weve broken all the charm <eos> but letting go is not the same <eos> as pushing someone else away <eos> so please dont let on <eos> you dont know me <eos> please dont let on <eos> im not here <eos> please dont let on <eos> you dont love me <eos> cause i know you do <eos> i know <eos> that some make it mistake it <eos> some force and some will fake it <eos> i never meant to let you down <eos>

know a man <eos> it takes a lot to understand <eos> the warrior the sage <eos> the little boy enraged <eos> it takes a lot to know a woman <eos> a lot to understand whats humming <eos> the honeybee the sting <eos> the little girl with wings <eos> it takes a lot to give to ask for help <eos> to be yourself to know and love what you live with <eos> it takes a lot to breathe to touch to feel <eos> the slow reveal of what another body needs <eos> it takes a lot to know a man <eos> a lot to know to understand <eos> the father and the son <eos> the hunter and the gun <eos> it takes a lot know a woman <eos> a lot to comprehend whats coming <eos> the mother and the child <eos> the muse and the beguiled <eos> it takes a lot to give to ask for help <eos> to be yourself to know and love what you

sitting on the ground <eos> good for nothing cept kicking around <eos> she died with her hands stretched out <eos> she died with a hungry mouth <eos> she died with her mind full of doubt <eos> and thoughts of weakening <eos> so may your river never dry <eos> and may your mouth never lie <eos> and may you be satisfied to never know why <eos> sometimes someone just wants to die <eos> so whered you get those cuts in your hand <eos> i thought i told you about playing in the sand <eos> theres always someone careless with glass <eos> theres always questions you dont want to ask <eos> she died with her hands stretched out <eos> she died with a hungry mouth <eos> she died with her mind full of doubt <eos> and thoughts of weakening <eos> so may your river never dry <eos> and may your mouth never lie <eos> and may you be satisfied to never know why <eos> sometimes someone just wants to die <eos> so lonely soldier go home <eos> lonely but never alone <eos> good eyes see nothing to shoot <eos> good feet feel good giving up good boots wherever you are <eos> you know that i adore you <eos> no matter how far <eos> well i can go before you <eos> and if ever you need someone <eos> well not

just came across a manger <eos> out among the danger <eos> somewhere in a strangers eye <eos> wherever you go <eos> well i can always follow <eos> i can feed this real slow <eos> if its a lot to swallow <eos> and if you just want to be alone <eos> well i can wait without waiting <eos> if you want me to let this go <eos> well im more than willing <eos> oh cause i dont want to change you <eos> i dont want to change you <eos> i dont want to change your mind <eos> i just came across a manger <eos> out among the danger <eos> somewhere in a strangers eye <eos> oh and i dont want to change you <eos> i dont want to change her <eos> dont want to change your mind <eos> i just came across a manger <eos> out among the danger <eos> somewhere in a strangers eye <eos> ive never been with anyone <eos> in the way ive been with you <eos> but if love is not for fun <eos> then its doomed <eos> cause water races <eos> water races down the waterfalls <eos> the water races <eos> water races down the waterfall <eos> and i dont want to change you <eos> i dont want to change you <eos> i dont want to change your mind <eos> i just came across a manger <eos> where there is no the danger <eos> where love has eyes and is not blind weve wanted to be trusty and true <eos> but feathers fell from our wings <eos> and weve wanted to be worthy of you <eos> but weather rained on our dreams <eos> and we cant take back <eos> what is done what is past <eos> so fellas lay down your fears <eos> cause we cant take back <eos> what is done what is past <eos> so let us start from here <eos> cause we never wanted to be lusty or lewd <eos> nor tethered to prudish strings <eos> and we never wanted to be jealously tuned <eos> nor withered into ugly things <eos> but we cant take back <eos> what is done what is past <eos> so fellas lay down your spears <eos> cause we cant take back <eos> what is done what is past <eos> so let us start from here <eos> and if all that you are <eos> is not all you desire <eos> then come <eos> come let yourself be wrong <eos> come its already begun <eos> come come alone <eos> come with fear come with love <eos> come however you are <eos> just come come alone <eos> come with friends come with foes <eos> come however you are <eos> just come come alone <eos> come with me then let go <eos> come however you are <eos> just come come alone <eos> come so carefully closed <eos> come however you are <eos> just come <eos> come come along <eos> come with sorrows and songs <eos> come however you are <eos> just come come along <eos> come let yourself be wrong <eos> come however you are <eos> just come i tried to repress it then i carried its crown <eos> i reached out to undress it and love let me down <eos> love let me down <eos> so i tried to erase it but the ink bled right through <eos> almost drove myself crazy when these words led to you <eos> and all these useless dreams of living alone <eos> like a dogless bone <eos> so come let me love you <eos> come let

mornings break while youre still sleeping in <eos> still white and strangely distant daylight dries on your lawn <eos> reflections in the smoke from the other side <eos> a thousand miles from home and youre feeling tired <eos> the traffic stops the street from becoming lonely highway nights ghost trains grey tracks and a crooked skyline <eos> red dust clouds carry shadows from a distant light <eos> a million different ways to get to your destination <eos> only one way to get to the otherside <eos> do you know where you are asleep in the back seat <eos> under the southern stars the southern stars <eos> cause its a long way home if you dont know which way to go <eos> a one way ticket to an unknown constellation <eos> five stars sixpack will you make it back tonight <eos> big city turns to the other for a conversation <eos> while smokestacks glisten in the middle of a forest fire <eos> do you know where you are asleep in the back seat <eos> under the southern stars the southern stars <eos> cause its a long way home if you dont know which way to go <eos> yeah its a long way home if you dont know which way to go <eos> and were spinning in circles but we dont care <eos> yeah were miles from anywhere <eos> where the ghost trains go and the grey tracks grow <eos> where the ghost trains go and the grey tracks grow <eos> where the ghost trains go and the grey tracks grow <eos> where the ghost trains go the lighthouse is open the storms been exposed to the sea <eos> i called the cab ride over to rescue me <eos> the lines at the station cast shadows like a michigan stream <eos> and i saw the day break between the telephone lines and the street <eos> hold your hands out till the traffic has stopped <eos> and ill take the road that leads to your heart <eos> the gaslight is blinking a souvenir picture of you <eos> im inside a bubble youre inside a bubble too <eos> the night finds itself in the arms of the morning air <eos> and youre waking up now from the curves in the road again

<eos> the long flight home and the long goodbye <eos> vacant rooms but the car park is full again <eos> on the roof theres no view through the looking glass <eos> a whisper of the calm connecting flight to the place you call your home <eos> the wonder of a space the great divide the sand inside your shoes <eos> where the air is clean and your heart is singing a lullaby <eos> polystyrene cups and things the road treats you well <eos> the road gives you diamond rings <eos> vacant rooms but the car park is full again <eos> and on the roof theres no view through the looking glass <eos> a whisper of the calm connecting flight to the place you call your home <eos> the wonder of a space the great divide the sand inside your shoes <eos> where the air is clean and your heart is singing a lullaby <eos> the engines still warm the highways so cold in your dark red cadillac <eos> a whisper of the calm connecting flight to the place you call your home <eos> the wonder of a space the great divide the sand inside your shoes <eos> where the air is clean and your heart is singing a lullaby solo <eos> she stands at six feet tall <eos> with her back to the wall <eos> her voice is soft as saharas sand <eos> on the dryest land <eos> put my faith in the swan on the water <eos> there is more to her tan you could know <eos> when the jewels are raining down <eos> to sit on broken ground <eos> prechorus <eos> shell be there <eos> when the wall falls down <eos> dont be scared <eos> if it all comes down <eos> chorus <eos> love me to pieces <eos> hold my hands high <eos> lift my head up towards <eos> blinding light x <eos> solo <eos> were dancing like were dumb <eos> under summer stars <eos> but the light was playing tricks <eos> almost taken too far <eos> when were falling all over the place <eos> and her lust is enough to take <eos> those lips are burning red <eos> still like a day when we met <eos> prechorus <eos> shell be there <eos> when the wall falls down <eos> dont be scared <eos> if it all comes down <eos> chorus <eos> love me to pieces <eos> hold my hands high <eos> lift my head up towards <eos> blinding light x <eos> outro <eos> and im begging mercy <eos> just

youve got to show me how <eos> like a rush of blood to the head <eos> you were crushing hearts till the end <eos> was a young love lost in the night <eos> are we in too deep to decide <eos> put the beat in my heart the words in my mouth <eos> kept me out of the dark <eos> you put the taste i my tongue the life in my soul <eos> gave me air for my lungs <eos> like a rush of blood to the head <eos> you were crushing hearts till the end <eos> was a young love lost in the night <eos> are we in too deep to decide <eos> like a rush of blood to the head <eos> you were crushing hearts till the end

you away <eos> and with this song ill say goodbye <eos> and thank you for what youve done to my life <eos> and finally ill say it with love <eos> i hope youre at rest in the stars above <eos> and i dont understand what you died for <eos> we still could have given so much more <eos> and i know you are something i could never be <eos> but i know youre still there watching over me <eos> now now now now in better days ive been known to listen <eos> i go to waste all my time is missing <eos> im mapping out my ending <eos> its never gonna happen now <eos> these things are condescending <eos> with everybody backing down <eos> you pray to stars that can help you get by <eos> and all at once you forget to try <eos> id go there if you let me <eos> theyre never gonna find me now <eos> my life is always empty <eos> and in and out of doubt <eos> your not coming back for me these things they will never be <eos> im so used to being wrong so put me where i belong <eos> ill get back to you <eos> god knows i try <eos> but i still lose <eos> and i get back to you <eos> these days run by <eos> but i still lose <eos> angels say they can make you suffer <eos> they give and take like a vicious lover <eos> when all this loses meaning <eos> youll never want it back somehow <eos> awake but still im dreaming <eos> and never waking up <eos> alonewhere im not alone you abandoned me <eos> love dont live here anymore <eos> just a vacancy <eos> love dont live here anymore <eos> when you lived inside of me <eos> there was nothing i could conceive <eos> that you wouldnt do for me <eos> trouble seemed so far away <eos> you changed that right away baby <eos> you abandoned me <eos> love dont live here anymore <eos> just a vacancy <eos> love dont live here anymore <eos> love dont live here anymore <eos> just emptiness and memories <eos> of what we had before <eos> you went away <eos> found another place to stay another home so ill cross my heart <eos> and hope to die <eos> before i have a chance to lie <eos> to you my dear <eos> oh i wish no harm <eos> i know the end will turn out wrong <eos> see ive been known to fall in love <eos> but sometimes love just is not enough <eos> my heart will stray <eos> before too long <eos> so please forgive me when i sing this song <eos> i sing this song if anyone rises at <eos> and fakes all day that theyre having their fun <eos> they never did get it right <eos> since they got it so low <eos> to anyone drinking the morning away <eos> the afternoon will prove a mistake <eos> they never will get it right <eos> now theyve got it so low <eos> chorus <eos> and we laugh and we drink <eos> and we teach ourselves not to think <eos> we never did get it right <eos> since we got it so low <eos> to all of the faces that freeze for you there <eos> in your memory when you try not to care <eos> they never disappear down the slow road <eos> for all of those people who bleed by the side <eos> and split from their tongues <eos> and sharpen their knives <eos> they never will get a life <eos> now theyve got it so low <eos> chorus <eos> cornfields and pigtails and fish in the stream <eos> the night when the boys stole the billion dollar dream <eos> from the highjinx school for girls <eos> down the road <eos> stories are smoke trails <eos> and some may be true <eos> youre listening to me <eos> but im talking to you <eos> i hope you never fall from grace <eos> if you get it so low <eos> chorus <eos> and we laugh and we drink <eos> and we find it hard not to think <eos> we never did get it right <eos> since we got it so low stay the night and i promise i wont die <eos> without you there and i cant and i cant close my eyes <eos> but i cant leave myself tonight <eos> and i was still lost inside <eos> and now waiting for everything <eos> to fall into place <eos> waiting for everything <eos> to fall <eos> most nights i cry myself awake <eos> and she waits my love my love falls away <eos> well i sit alone again today <eos> wonder why everything went this way <eos> and now waiting for everything <eos> to fall into place <eos> waiting for everything <eos> to fall into place <eos> waiting for everything <eos> to fall <eos> and i cry myself awake <eos> and i cry myself awake so now youre not there <eos> but your ghost still burns in the air <eos> finally above us the waves have come <eos> to take you away <eos> and with this song ill say goodbye <eos> and thank you for what youve done to my life <eos> and finally ill say it with love <eos> i hope youre at rest in the stars above <eos> and i dont understand what you died for <eos> we still could have given so much more <eos> and i know you are something i could never be <eos> but i know youre still there watching over me <eos> now x you could have the sun <eos> you could have the water <eos> this id give to you <eos> you could be the moon <eos> you could be the harbour <eos> i arrive to <eos> you could come over uninvited <eos> you said im the one <eos> the one to hold you <eos> does that go for others too <eos> no surprise x <eos> yesterday around am <eos> i thought about you <eos> for a minute or two <eos> i know its no good <eos> i feel so lonely <eos> sleeping without you <eos> how come your arms are not around me <eos> i said im the one <eos> the one to hold you <eos> but i guess he said that too <eos> no surprise x this is the one we were hoping for <eos> she loves while he lies <eos> she held his back all the way now her arms so tired <eos> why didnt he stay <eos> this is the one we were hoping for <eos> he cries when she loves <eos> he laughs his way down to when hell realize <eos> then he will say <eos> "say you werent cool say you werent fine <eos> say you werent tough enough strong enough for my love" <eos> "say you werent cool say you werent fine <eos> say you werent tough enough strong enough for my love" <eos> this is the one we were hoping for <eos> she dies when he lies <eos> she held her eyes down as he walked on by <eos> well she said oh no <eos> he cries she lies <eos> then he dies <eos> say you werent cool say you werent fine <eos> say you werent tough enough strong enough for my love <eos> say you werent cool say you werent fine <eos> say you werent tough enough strong enough for my love i get so get so distracted <eos> by some peoples reactions <eos> that i dont see my own faults <eos> for what they are <eos> for what they are <eos> at times so self destructive <eos> with no intent or warning <eos> but behind this emotion <eos> theres a sensible heart <eos> a sensible heart <eos> im no king i wear no crown <eos> but desperate times seem over now <eos> yet still i weaken somehow <eos> and it tears me apart <eos> it tears me apart <eos> well i hope to learn as time goes by <eos> that i should trust whats deep inside <eos> burning bright oh burning bright <eos> my sensible heart ive been up for days <eos> trying to find a way to write my confession down <eos> seems every line i writes amiss <eos> at least this ill admit <eos> i never hear that perfect sound <eos> but then the judge walks and says <eos> boy you cant pretend youve got to be honest now <eos> my verdict has come in <eos> it says im guilty for my sins this time <eos> i thought i could escape <eos> but then i finally felt the weight <eos> of my crimes <eos> this is passion its not love <eos> infatuation never ends up right <eos> at least i wont be alone tonight <eos> cause i dont want to be alone tonight <eos> the prosecution rests <eos> they had convincing evidence <eos> it seems ive been deceived <eos> so now i stand alone and wait for the first stone <eos> to be cast upon me <eos> my verdict has come in <eos> it says im guilty for my sins this time <eos> i thought i could escape <eos> but then i finally felt the weight of my crimes <eos> this is passion its not love <eos> infatuation never ends up right <eos> at least i wont be alone tonight <eos> cause i dont want to be alone tonight <eos> if convicted i will surely do my time so this is continuous happiness <eos> you know i always imagined it something more <eos> with the right drapes the right paints <eos> the right frames this could really work <eos> what a great day to spend indoors <eos> chorus <eos> wake wake up wake wake up <eos> wake wake up wake wake up <eos> wake wake up wake wake up <eos> wake wake up wake wake up <eos> in a hail of sparks <eos> and a tangle of wires <eos> everything went wrong <eos> so where has all the day gone <eos> and why are my lungs aching when i breathe <eos> is there something wrong with the heat why am i so cold <eos> and my heart feels sick and it hurts when i speak <eos> and this is not what i hoped for <eos> chorus <eos> was this what we hoped for <eos> was this what we hoped for <eos> was this what we what we hoped for <eos> was this what we hoped for <eos> was this what we hoped for <eos> was this wait <eos> i have to tell <eos> you something <eos> important <eos> stay <eos> remain close to me <eos> so i can feel important <eos> cause its your eyes i dont believe <eos> and my heart you will mislead <eos> do you know the consequences my love <eos> that comes with such confidence <eos> holding all the weight in my life <eos> now you turn and walk away from me <eos> holding all the weight in my life <eos> now you turn and walk away from me <eos> so what is this now you ask of me <eos> what makes your pain such an urgency <eos> now i want out so plain to see <eos> once again my dear a new tragedy <eos> holding all the weight in my life <eos> now you turn and walk away from me <eos> holding all the weight in my life <eos> now you turn and walk away from me i feel a love thats so hard to bear <eos> wont you come kiss me and take this despair <eos> let the morning time dapple its light in your hair <eos> like warm running water in snow <eos> but i feel a love of jealousy and pain <eos> lost in the race tween the foolish and vain <eos> come in the morning time whistle to take you away <eos> where the sun always burns in the winter <eos> ohhere in my heart <eos> ohhere in my heart <eos> and i know that all im saying is wrong <eos> etched in the night time and rhymed in a song <eos> come tomorrow ill lightenup and drink to the ones <eos> who love without asking for loving <eos> dont forsake me <eos> the morning time plays at the childrens door <eos> if you leave me <eos> then what would i tell them youre leaving for <eos> i feel a love thats so hard to bear <eos> wont you come kiss me and take this despair <eos> let the morning time dapple its light in your hair <eos> like warm running water in snow someday i will walk away <eos> when time aint drawing on me like a blade <eos> back turned to the setting sun <eos> leaving behind torontos incessant hum <eos> cause i was born and raised <eos> to live beyond <eos> the heft and weight <eos> of a world undone <eos> chorus <eos> but i dont mean to be a bother <eos> i dont need you to take my burden away <eos> and i aint afraid of dying <eos> cold and alone <eos> traipsing though the utter dark <eos> walking underneath the dead moonlight <eos> without any great concern <eos> for what ive missed or how many bridges have burned <eos> like a bird who flies <eos> all the way from the north <eos> my heart will roam <eos> in search of warmth <eos> chorus <eos> when my time comes <eos> when i was young <eos> i didnt know too much <eos> i thought that i could rule the world <eos> then i grew up <eos> i found out life was hard <eos> harder than stone what if i did not love you <eos> where would that leave me <eos> would i wonder through the avenues <eos> under a pall of misery <eos> would i be face down in the gutter <eos> with cheap whiskey on my breath <eos> the lonely life of a writer <eos> whose words could not pay his debts <eos> singin please dont please dont pass me by <eos> i am alive oh cant you see <eos> that ive been blinded completely <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> i am alive oh cant you see <eos> that i am pleading for your mercy <eos> what if we became strangers <eos> would you notice my face in a crowd <eos> and could you hear the sorrow in my voice <eos> helplessly crying your name out loud <eos> would i be searching for a savior <eos> burned and burning with regret <eos> the lonely life of a writer <eos> only if one last desperate request <eos> singin please dont please dont pass me by <eos> i am alive oh cant you see <eos> that ive been blinded completely <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> i am alive oh cant you see <eos> that i am pleading for your mercy <eos> ive been on the lam <eos> being hunted somethin fierce <eos> they say time and tide it waits for no man <eos> but i was just hopin <eos> these storm filled skies would clear <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> please dont please dont pass me by <eos> i am alive oh cant you see <eos> that i am pleading for your mercy originally by neil young <eos> hello cowgirl in the sand <eos> is this place <eos> at your command <eos> can i stay here <eos> for a while <eos> can i see your <eos> sweet sweet smile <eos> old enough now <eos> to change your name <eos> when so many love you <eos> is it the same <eos> its the woman in you <eos> that makes you want <eos> to play this game <eos> hello ruby in the dust <eos> has your band <eos> begun to rust <eos> after all <eos> the sin weve had <eos> i thought wed <eos> might turn back <eos> old enough now <eos> to change your name <eos> when so many love you <eos> is it the same <eos> its the woman in you <eos> that makes you want <eos> to play this game <eos> hello woman of my dreams <eos> this is not <eos> the way it seems <eos> purple words <eos> on a grey background <eos> to be a woman <eos> and to be turned down <eos> old enough now <eos> to change your name <eos> when so many love you <eos> is it the same <eos> its the woman in you <eos> that makes you want <eos> to play this game everyone wants everything <eos> no matter the cost were longing to live in a dream <eos> but we cant let go to all that we think we know <eos> this great escape until we give up the ghost <eos> but why are we so worried more about the hurry <eos> and less about the harm <eos> always trying to conquer <eos> that which does not offer <eos> anything more than a broken heart <eos> oh what a cost for love <eos> i only want oh simple things <eos> mourning the lost and what could have been <eos> when did i let go to all that i used to know <eos> this grave mistake has left the absence of hope <eos> and why are we so worried more about the hurry <eos> and less about the harm <eos> always trying to conquer <eos> that which does not offer <eos> anything more than a broken heart <eos> oh what a cost for love <eos> oh what a cost for love <eos> a cost for love <eos> im going back to the start <eos> im going back to the start whys everyone still singing about california <eos> havent we heard enough about the golden state <eos> i guess if you like sandy beaches and blue ocean water <eos> theres something about it to which i cannot relate <eos> i need to see the leaves change and the snowflakes falling <eos> i need to hear the call the wind whistling through the winter pines <eos> chorus <eos> whys everyone still singing about california <eos> havent we heard enough about the golden state <eos> and people still follow them dreams to sweet california <eos> and from time to time i pass on by but i will never stay <eos> sure there are beautiful people in the city of lost angels <eos> theyre living like theyre kings and queens from some royal age <eos> but fortune and fame wont save you when california <eos> is wiped out by the ring of fire or a great earthquake <eos> chorus <eos> no i will never stay <eos> never stay <eos> never stay when i think of fates worse than death <eos> all i can think of is something you said <eos> you said we were golden bright like the sun <eos> and now i am stranded <eos> knowing im not the one <eos> an ocean of anger <eos> flowing through me <eos> blood stained and broken <eos> from when i fell to sea <eos> and just like a snake charmer <eos> you led me astray <eos> living in distress <eos> hoping help is on the way <eos> in the midst of a storm <eos> searching for shelter <eos> i came upon <eos> one single feather <eos> a halfhearted wish <eos> for something better <eos> gracefully cursed i thirst <eos> attached to the soil <eos> im guiding the wool <eos> as i am in my blood <eos> yet so venerable <eos> but after im gone <eos> once i finally leave <eos> you will be left alone <eos> to the wolves and the thieves theres a murder of crows <eos> flying high over head <eos> on this desolate road <eos> well i tend to forget <eos> about you and i <eos> and ill fight to survive <eos> through this thunderous life <eos> when were not side by side <eos> im roaming through the hills <eos> all alone <eos> im trying to find my direction home <eos> a question of space <eos> a matter of time <eos> i follow the stars until the first light <eos> i dont know what drugs to take <eos> to successfully alter the state <eos> that my mind has been in as of late <eos> something is eating away at my brain <eos> theres an elephant in the back of the room <eos> and its standing in plain view <eos> everyone can see <eos> that it looks just like me <eos> im roaming through the hills <eos> all alone <eos> im trying to find my direction home <eos> a question of space <eos> a matter of time <eos> i follow the stars until the first light <eos> i will not call this road home <eos> though it is all i know <eos> i will not call this road home <eos> though it is all i know <eos> im roaming through the hills <eos> all alone <eos> im trying to find my direction home <eos> a question of space <eos> a matter of time <eos> i follow the stars until the first light and i know its not to get away from me <eos> you just need a change of scenery <eos> so strange how everything went wrong so fast <eos> and i hope that this confusion does not last <eos> cause these words might be too little too late <eos> and im afraid that i have already lost you <eos> now three months equals eternity and this will be so hard <eos> and i will long to hold you in my arms <eos> and when you ask do you love me <eos> i should reply with yes most certainly <eos> i always hesitate theres something lingering <eos> i will try harder to be all that i can be <eos> these words might be too little too late <eos> an im afraid that i have already lost you <eos> now three months equals eternity and this will be so hard <eos> and i will long to hold you in my arms so lets face it this was never what you wanted <eos> and i know its fun to pretend <eos> now blank stares and empty threats <eos> are all i have theyre all i have <eos> so drown me and if you can <eos> or we could just have conversation <eos> and i fall i fall i faulter <eos> but i found you before i drift away <eos> now you still speak of day old hate <eos> though your whole world has gone up into flames <eos> and isnt it great to find that youre really worth nothing <eos> and how safe it is to feel safe <eos> so drown me and if you can <eos> or we could just have conversation <eos> and i fall i fall i fall down <eos> but i found you before i drift away with you on my mind <eos> and my heart held in your hands <eos> screaming <eos> break me <eos> break me <eos> oooh oh <eos> with you on my mind <eos> and my heart held in your hands <eos> screaming <eos> break me <eos> break me <eos> oooh oh so go on <eos> and i will refrain <eos> and ill keep on running this never ending race <eos> maybe next time will be the right time <eos> and maybe next time will be your time <eos> so save your scissors <eos> for someone elses skin <eos> my surface is so tough <eos> i dont think the blade will dig in <eos> save your strength <eos> save your wasted time <eos> theres no way that i want you to be left behind <eos> go on save your scissors <eos> save your scissors <eos> so why does it always seem <eos> that every time i turn around <eos> somebody falls in love with me <eos> this has never been my soul intention <eos> and i have never claimed to have patents on such inventions <eos> just save your scissors <eos> for someone elses skin <eos> my surface is so tough <eos> i dont think the blade will dig in <eos> save your strength <eos> save your wasted time <eos> theres no way that i want you to be left behind <eos> go on save your scissors <eos> save your scissors <eos> there is something that i must confess to you tonight <eos> to you tonight <eos> and that is i expect nothing less from you tonight <eos> from you tonight <eos> go on save your scissors <eos> save your scissors <eos> save your scissors your words are like knives <eos> they peel my skin and pierce my soul <eos> your body will burn tonight <eos> though your heart may still remain cold <eos> and i will blame myself <eos> and i will blame myself <eos> for holding on to what i hoped would keep you by my side <eos> i will blame myself <eos> the sheets are stained with <eos> memories of your soft kiss <eos> now this is all i have <eos> paper and pen to remember you with <eos> and i will blame myself <eos> and i will blame myself <eos> for holding on to what i hoped would keep you by my side <eos> i will blame myself <eos> can i have you <eos> can i have you <eos> can i have you <eos> can i have you if i was a simple man <eos> would we still walk hand in hand <eos> and if i suddenly went blind <eos> would you still look in my eyes <eos> what happens when i grow old <eos> and all my stories have been told <eos> will your heart still race for me <eos> or will it march to a new beat <eos> if i was a simple man <eos> if i was a simple man <eos> id own no home id own no land <eos> would you still stand by my side <eos> and would our flame still burn so bright <eos> sometimes i wonder why <eos> im so full of these endless rhymes <eos> about the way i feel inside <eos> i wish i could just get a ride <eos> if i was a simple man <eos> and i could make you understand <eos> thered be no reason to think twice <eos> youd be my sun youd be my light <eos> if i was a simple man <eos> if i was a simple man i know stars are aligned <eos> but they dont align for us <eos> excuse me for i am the ocean <eos> and i will starve for you <eos> will you know how to stay brave <eos> such fragile moments we share <eos> and you are my everything <eos> and even with nothing to say so there goes my life <eos> passing by with every exit sign <eos> its been so long <eos> sometimes i wonder how i will stay strong <eos> no sleep tonight <eos> ill keep on driving these dark highway lines <eos> and as the moon fades <eos> one more night gone only twenty more days <eos> but i will see you again <eos> i will see you again a long time from now <eos> and there goes my life <eos> passing by with every departing flight <eos> and its been so hard <eos> so much time so far apart <eos> and she walks the night <eos> how many hearts will die tonight <eos> and when things have changed <eos> i guess ill find out in seventeen days <eos> but i will see you again <eos> i will see you again a long time from now <eos> my body aches <eos> and it hurts to say <eos> no one is moving <eos> and i wish that i werent here tonight <eos> but this is my life <eos> and i will see you again <eos> i will see you again a long time from now <eos> and i will see you again <eos> i will see you again a long time from now and you can try to fight this all you

add more dollars <eos> to their names <eos> then one evening <eos> so suddenly and violent <eos> there was an explosion <eos> they cant explain <eos> oooh x <eos> dallas green with tegan and sara <eos> now the deep water horizon <eos> desends down to deaths door <eos> and at the birds foot <eos> they lost all hope <eos> cause oil is driftin <eos> for miles and miles <eos> poisoning the gulf of mexico <eos> but of the eleven <eos> men at the bottom <eos> who sank to an underwater grave <eos> and while they were sinking <eos> and their lungs filled with oil <eos> they must have been screaming <eos> screaming to be saved <eos> oooh repeats until end of song <eos> but of the eleven <eos> men at the bottom <eos> who sank to an underwater grave <eos> while they were sinking <eos> their lungs filling with oil <eos> they must have been screaming <eos> screaming to be saved when she sleeps <eos> there is a fever dream yeah <eos> it brings a night terror <eos> to haunt this fragile bird <eos> she speaks in tounges <eos> her words they come undone yeah <eos> and with the wayward mind <eos> she struggles through the night <eos> all that i can do <eos> is hope she makes it through through the night through the night <eos> these cold nightmares <eos> they make her worse for ware <eos> lost in the dark <eos> shes got a heavy heart <eos> and when she wakes <eos> in her fragile state <eos> when she calls my name <eos> hopin that i keep her safe <eos> all that i can do <eos> is hope she makes it through <eos> all that i can do <eos> is hope she makes it through <eos> through the night x <eos> all that i can do <eos> is hope she makes it through <eos> all that i can do <eos> is hope she makes it through <eos> through the night what if i cant be all that you need me to be weve got a

degree of difficulty in dealing with me from my haunted past comes a daunting task of living through memories if we could just hang a mirror on the bedroom wall stare into the past and forget it all <eos> so when we leave be a quick midnight escape well disconnect ourselves from all of yesterday ill dig for water and fashion our very own wishing well then well throw our coins down hoping to rid us of this little hell <eos> chorus theres a degree of difficulty in dealing with me from my haunted past comes a daunting task of living through memories if we could just hang a mirror on the bedroom wall stare into the past and forget it all <eos> will we get out of this little hell x this highways dark and empty <eos> just miles and miles of endless road <eos> ive got a sickness pounding in my head <eos> im at the mercy of the ghost <eos> what would it take to live <eos> as if i would not another day <eos> to live without despair <eos> and to be without disdain <eos> how can i instill such hope <eos> but be left with none of my own <eos> what if i could sing <eos> just one song <eos> and it might save somebodys life <eos> i sought after <eos> after reasons to stay <eos> i was lost <eos> i was lost <eos> then the sky turned black <eos> and the rains poured down <eos> i was waiting <eos> waiting to be found <eos> oh no <eos> how can i instill such hope <eos> but be left with none of my own <eos> what if i could sing <eos> just one song <eos> and it might save somebodys life <eos> then i would sing <eos> all that i can sing <eos> cause that is when <eos> when i feel that im not just counting time <eos> oh when i sing <eos> all that i can sing <eos> maybe just for the moment <eos> things would seem alright <eos> oh when i sing <eos> oh when i sing <eos> oh when i sing <eos> oh when i sing can you imagine all the homes abandoned and all alone <eos> with no one left to care for them wilting in moss <eos> the paint is peeling off the walls <eos> the corners are filling up with dust <eos> cigarette smoke hangs in the air <eos> and the grass aint growing like it did long ago <eos> whether a natural disaster ripped it from its foundation <eos> or an economic tragedy tore apart its family <eos> theyre all empty <eos> the pipes have long since seized <eos> the windows are all boarded up <eos> theres no electricity flowing through these lifeless veins <eos> cracks are running down the walls <eos> where picture frames used to hang <eos> a hint of heartbreak still lingers in the air <eos> and weeds have choked the breath out of it long ago <eos> whether a natural disaster ripped it from its foundation <eos> or an economic tragedy tore apart its family <eos> theyre all empty <eos> theyre all empty youre the northern wind <eos> sending shivers down my spine <eos> youre like fallen leaves <eos> in an autumn night <eos> youre the lullaby <eos> thats singing me to sleep <eos> you are the other half <eos> youre like a missing piece <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> you dont know <eos> what you do to me <eos> you are all four seasons <eos> rolled into one <eos> youre like the cold december snow <eos> in the warm july sun <eos> im the jet black sky <eos> thats just before the rain <eos> like the mighty current <eos> pullin you under the waves <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> you dont know <eos> what you do to me <eos> im the darkest hour <eos> just before the dawn <eos> and im slowly sinking <eos> into the slough of despond <eos> like an old guitar <eos> worn out and left behind <eos> i have stories left to tell <eos> theyre of the healing kind <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> oh my love <eos> if i could just <eos> find you tonight <eos> if i could just find you tonight <eos> oh my love <eos> do

covered in rust <eos> and everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared <eos> oh everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared <eos> the colours were drained straight from the sky <eos> and nothing living had survived <eos> the mountains were merely removed from the earth <eos> all silver and gold had lost its worth <eos> and everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared <eos> oh everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared <eos> i woke from the dream in a cold cold sweat <eos> i was full of doubt and deep regret <eos> for suddenly it was all so clear to me <eos> there was nothing left in which to believe <eos> and everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared <eos> oh everything i loved and feared <eos> had all at once disappeared sorrowing man <eos> look how worn youve become <eos> you once were lord of the barren sea <eos> theres blood on our hands <eos> in this perfect madness <eos> were living on borrowed time <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> theres no sympathy <eos> for we dont know the cure <eos> cos what youve got <eos> well it runs too deep <eos> but youve lived and breathed <eos> more than any man i know <eos> but youre not done <eos> oh at least i hope <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> in this life that we have made together <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> oh how you have lost your way <eos> oh how you have lost your way come close <eos> lay next to me <eos> come

rise above all the ash <eos> chorus cause were gonna live x at last <eos> so bright the flames burn in the heart that we found each other in the dark my peace out in the wilderness we are fighting to survive and convalesce <eos> chorus were gonna live x like the rest <eos> feel the blacks of these waters and the cold lonely air on the rock restless seas the vessel in deep disrepair and i swore they started singing but then come rejoice i can still hear your voice <eos> then i heard the church bells from afar but we found each other in the dark o sister <eos> whats wrong with your mind <eos> you used to be so strong and stable <eos> my sister <eos> what made you fall from grace <eos> im sorry that i was not there to catch you <eos> what have the demons done <eos> what have the demons done <eos> with the luminous light that once shined from your eyes <eos> what makes you feel so alone <eos> is it the whispering ghost that you fear the most <eos> but the blackness in your heart it wont last forever <eos> i know its tearing you apart but its a storm you can weather <eos> o sister <eos> those lines etched in your hands <eos> theyre hardened and rough like a road map of sorrow <eos> my sister <eos> there is a sadness on your face <eos> youre like a motherless child whos longing for comfort <eos> whats running through your veins thats causing you such pain <eos> does it have something to do with the pills they gave to you <eos> what is eating at your soul <eos> was it the whispering ghost that left you out in the cold <eos> but the blackness in your heart wont last forever <eos> i know its tearing you apart but its a storm you can weather <eos> ooh ooh ooh hmm <eos> o sister <eos> my sister <eos> o sister <eos> my sister i fear im dying of complications <eos>

<eos> you give him burdensome times <eos> and he will escape unscarred <eos> i guess i take after my mother <eos> i guess i take after my mother <eos> i used to be quite resilient <eos> gain no strength from counting the beads on a rosary <eos> and now the wound has begun to turn <eos> another lesson that has gone unlearned <eos> but this is not a cry for pity or for sympathy id like to take my time <eos> theres a good reason i must find <eos> i want to put a few miles down <eos> id like to feel my two feet on the ground <eos> another years hard work done <eos> ive paid for it with all of my blood <eos> ive given you more than im worth <eos> i want to dig my fingers into the earth <eos> because i know theres beauty buried beneath <eos> the surface of what we see <eos> all hopes left unfound <eos> they lie between the wish and the well <eos> the sound is just rising up <eos> mother birds feeding their young <eos> the light of a brand new day <eos> i think weve finally found a home in this place <eos> and now i know theres beauty buried beneath <eos> the surface of what we see <eos> all hopes left unfound <eos> they lie between the wish and the well <eos> i know theres beauty

words of happiness <eos> i will wait for all the words of jubilation <eos> i will hope for just an ounce of confidence <eos> to offer myself some sort of congratulations <eos> there is a light im trying to find <eos> between the water and the open sky <eos> i know thats where the wild winds blow wild winds blow <eos> through times of trouble <eos> or just a simple stumble <eos> i can go and make some real good noise <eos> still i wait for all the words of happiness <eos> still i wait for all the words of jubilation <eos> i will hope for just an ounce of confidence <eos> to offer myself some sort of congratulations bound for trouble from the start <eos> ive been walking through this old world in the dark <eos> all along right by my side <eos> there you were shining my ray of light

to what you said <eos> i can hear the devil whisper <eos> staking no way to his grave <eos> and im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> got my soul in a world of <eos> some postmortem dream <eos> i keep rolling on <eos> howling at the moon <eos> but im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> i have no understanding <eos> for standing outside of time <eos> three hundred thousand hours <eos> still i remain hungry for the lie <eos> the world is disappearing <eos> little by little day by day <eos> three hundred thousand hours <eos> still the weather it has not changed <eos> and im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> got my soul in a world of <eos> some postmortem dream <eos> i keep rolling on <eos> howling at the moon <eos> but im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> im all torn down <eos> i keep rolling on <eos> howling at the moon <eos> but im all torn down <eos> with these northern blues <eos> northern blues careless love <eos> quit pouring honey in my ears <eos> youre speaking diamonds crystal clear <eos> so far away i want you near <eos> crying out for more <eos> just a little more <eos> tied down on the floor <eos> like a prisoner of war <eos> oh ive been down so long <eos> the day is nearly gone <eos> i must carry on <eos> with this wasted love <eos> careless love <eos> theres more to say than should be said <eos> cant get these words straight in my head <eos> you make me feel so powerless <eos> im crying out for more <eos> just a little more <eos> tied down on the floor <eos> like a prisoner of war <eos> oh ive been here so long <eos> the day is nearly gone <eos> i must carry on <eos> with this wasted love <eos> wasted love <eos> wasted

taking what theyre giving <eos> right now it feels like killing time <eos> im running from the shadow of my former shadows life <eos> sometimes i wonder if i was ever really there <eos> right now it feels like killing time <eos> lately ive been thinking about <eos> just who im supposed to be <eos> there are lines forming on my hands and face <eos> before today i have never seen <eos> but right now it feels like killing time <eos> im running from the shadow of my former shadows life <eos> sometimes i wonder if i was ever really there <eos> right now it feels like killing time <eos> killing time oh <eos> killing time oh <eos> oh <eos> right now it feels like killing time <eos> im running from the shadow of my former shadows life <eos> sometimes i think that i was never really there <eos> right now it feels like killing time there is a map of the world <eos> that lies upon my weary face <eos> each line representing a mile <eos> i have traveled from place to place <eos> the colours are fading <eos> the edges are tattered <eos> its grown a little worn with age <eos> there is a map of the world <eos> that lies upon my weary face <eos> that i cannot erase <eos> i cannot erase <eos> oohooh <eos> i cannot erase <eos> the current of life pulled me under <eos> and i was swept away <eos> expanding the distance between us <eos> every second to every day <eos> i thought i had given <eos> all i could offer <eos> while trying to keep the dogs at bay <eos> but the current of life pulled me under <eos> and i was swept away <eos> beneath the tidal wave <eos> beneath the tidal wave <eos> oohooh <eos> beneath the tidal wave <eos> beneath the tidal wave <eos> i will be erased theres a funeral procession on the highway <eos> traffic screeches to a halt <eos> theres people searching for a better way <eos> to live their lives oh <eos> johnny lived a good life youll hear them say <eos> as tears of sadness soak the ground <eos> the reaper crept in took his breath away <eos> in the middle of the night oh <eos> we celebrate the lives of the dead <eos> its like a mans best party only happens when he dies <eos> we gather round to pay our respects <eos> while their souls are still searching for the light <eos> searching for the light <eos> so please dont come to me on my dying day <eos> just let me go in peace <eos> with all the things that i forgot to say <eos> racing through my mind oh <eos> and dont you bury me six feet under ground <eos> just burn my body in a box <eos> and let my ashes blow with the wind <eos> out into the night sky <eos> we celebrate the lives of the dead <eos> its like a mans best party only happens when he dies <eos> we gather round to pay our respects <eos> while their souls are still searching for the light <eos> searching for the light <eos> searching for the light oh <eos> searching for the light how much would you bet <eos> that if i tried hard enough <eos> i would spontaneously combust <eos> i wish i could disappear <eos> and run away from all of my fears <eos> i think im coming undone <eos> so stay the night <eos> i promise that i wont bite <eos> cause without you there <eos> i dont think i could close my eyes <eos> how do i end up this way <eos> a constant knot in my gut <eos> tied with uncertainty and with lust <eos> a classic case i suppose <eos> a haunted man who cant out run his ghosts <eos> theyre in my skin in my bones <eos> so stay the night <eos> i promise that i wont bite <eos> cause without you there <eos> i dont think i could close my eyes i awoke only to find my lungs empty <eos> and through the night so it seems im not breathing <eos> and now my dreams are nothing like they were meant to be <eos> and im breaking down i think im breaking down <eos> and im afraid to sleep because of what haunts me <eos> such as living with the uncertainty <eos> thatll never find the words to say <eos> which would completely explain just how im breaking down <eos> someone come and someone come and save my life <eos> maybe ill sleep when i am dead but now its like the night is taking sides <eos> and all the worries that occupy the back of my mind <eos> could it be this misery will suffice <eos> ive become a simple

i dont think i could close my eyes you need not to climb mountaintops <eos> you need not to cross the sea <eos> you need not to find a cure <eos> for everything that makes you weak <eos> you need not to reach for the stars <eos> when life becomes so dark <eos> and when the wind <eos> does blow against the grain <eos> you must follow your heart <eos> you must follow your heart <eos> when all your friends have come and gone <eos> and the sun no longer shines <eos> and the happiness for which you long <eos> is washed away like an oceans tide <eos> when all the hard times <eos> outweigh the good <eos> and all your words are misunderstood <eos> when the day seems lost from the stars <eos> you must follow your heart <eos> you must follow your heart <eos> if you feel youve paid the price <eos> and your wounds should cease to heal <eos> and everything you love in life <eos> spins like a winding wheel <eos> if you should wake to find youre abandoned <eos> and the road youve traveled <eos> leads to a dead end <eos> when death creeps in to play its part <eos> you must follow your heart <eos> you must follow your heart if priests and princes hollowed shadowed souls <eos> if devils are but angels cast to know <eos> i live forever with a sharp regret <eos> it might be a surprise to know i never wished for death <eos> a hint of misery made its way along <eos> to those whove never harmed or never wronged <eos> if honesty changed the hearts of men <eos> who could contend <eos> if all i thought were true <eos> in this great divide that is my life <eos> i fear to think of all id undo <eos> if all i thought were true i dont need to know <eos> why the oceans blue or how the flowers grow <eos> i dont need to live <eos> waiting on someone to forgive me for my sins <eos> like my father before <eos> me im a working man a working man <eos> but i dont need to beleive <eos> in the something that wont save my sanity <eos> no i dont need <eos> i dont need to know <eos> no i dont need to knoooow <eos> i dont need to knooow <eos> i dont need to knooow <eos> i dont want to live <eos> in a world where faces change from day to day <eos> and i dont want my life to be <eos> soo full of doubt and misery <eos> the years now pass with out a trace <eos> its something that i am learning to embrace <eos> how most fun nights are spent awake <eos> thinking about how i dont want to live that way <eos> no i dont want i dont want to live <eos> no i dont want to live <eos> i dont want to live <eos> i dont want to live <eos> i dont know what ive been told <eos> but if you dont believe the devil owns your soul <eos> well if this is the truth then to hell i go <eos> cause i dont need to know please believe in what i say <eos> cause im running out of ways to convey <eos> this lack of faith in myself <eos> thats becoming my own personal health <eos> vicious settles in <eos> my bones feel like theyre breaking through my skin <eos> well god damn you <eos> youre feeding on my

penmanship <eos> ive been working on my penmanship <eos> by this lantern lit so this love wont quit <eos> i am a dragon and i catapult my love <eos> over the castle wall <eos> ive gotta tell you

our camp at night <eos> and it rips through the silence all that is left is all i want is the best for our lives my dear <eos> and you know my wishes are sincere <eos> whats to say for the days i cannot bear <eos> a sunday smile you wore it for a while <eos> a cemetery mile we paused and sang <eos> a sunday smile you wore it for a while <eos> a cemetery mile we paused and sang <eos> a sunday smile and we felt true and <eos> we burnt to the ground <eos> left a view to admire <eos> with buildings inside church of white <eos> we burnt to the ground left a grave to admire <eos> and as we reach for the sky reach the church of white <eos> a sunday smile you wore it for a while <eos> a cemetery mile we paused and sang <eos> a sunday smile you wore it for a while <eos> a cemetery mile we paused and sang <eos> a sunday smile and we felt true and in the hall i heard your faints falling <eos> your trial and my corrections made <eos> you have all the prayers of my loose heart <eos> you have all the prayers of <eos> no i was not there on the church stairs <eos> the wind in my hair a flood through my tear carousels twirl all around exited youth <eos> i do not mind <eos> at all <eos> were tonight in a world full of thrills it can come carry me up <eos> far above <eos> it all <eos> its a long way down <eos> from here <eos> to the sound <eos> watch the faces <eos> go round <eos> to the stars <eos> then the ground <eos> ferris wheels carried us away <eos> not so long ago <eos> times ive betrayed <eos> where would we be now if i had taken your hand <eos> well the years they pass by slow <eos> dont they <eos> its a long way down <eos> from here <eos> to the sound <eos> watch the faces <eos> go round <eos> to the stars <eos> then the ground uptown the streets in a calming way <eos> and outside is warm as a bed with a maid <eos> and i find its all our waves and raves <eos> that makes the days go on this way <eos> i heard the sad sound of words <eos> spoken from a beak of a wise old bird <eos> uptown the streets are kept afloat <eos> and that girl never leaves me alone <eos> he means well saying <eos> ive got stories of wine superb <eos> and of course my childhood forks and knives <eos> and a hospital bed where i turned my life over and over again the lines are on board its quiet offshore <eos> but the wind blows <eos> the children are here but the women just stare <eos> from the windows <eos> see the lawns outside groomed green lawns <eos> oh how they glow <eos> and i spotted you there with curlers in hair <eos> on the telephone <eos> and i longed for you <eos> yes i long for you <eos> oh ill move for you <eos> yes ill move for you <eos> years spent round on the foyer <eos> as the maid sweeps dust <eos> and leaves from the back door <eos> my heart could be yours <eos> within dreams were free <eos> but youd always ask for more <eos> so ill move for you <eos> yes ill move for you <eos> oh ill move for you <eos> oh ill move for you the lights go on <eos> the lights go off <eos> when things dont feel right <eos> i lie down like a tired dog <eos> licking his wounds in the shade <eos> when i feel alive <eos> i try to imagine a careless life <eos> a scenic world where the sunsets are all <eos> breathtaking send me now the winters over <eos> a light turns out the winds are colder <eos> the love weve had will turn all over <eos> going south and we are older <eos> on the one tightrope you walked down <eos> on a night like this you all turn around <eos> no but i i wont hold you anymore <eos> no and i i cant have you anymore <eos> and some days were all alone <eos> on the banks of the rhine <eos> and some days all we had <eos> the salt in the sea <eos> <eos> and some days were all alone <eos> on the banks of the rhine walls gone over the sea <eos> but not for me <eos> watch now all will end <eos> now all that im under a tide <eos> now im under a tide <eos> tall hair under it all <eos> much more than i once had <eos> over seas they call it night <eos> they call it night <eos> and i know it well what can you do <eos> when the curtain falls <eos> what will you do <eos> when the curtain falls <eos> youll <eos> left right life life is all right on the rhine <eos> no but i know but i know <eos> i would have nowhere to go <eos> no but theres nowhere to go to go so alone <eos> i cry but something something <eos> i came through tonight just like you <eos> and all this advice has fallen through <eos> i watch and wait as <eos> something something <eos> i watch and wait as i let more time decide <eos> and so alone <eos> i cry but i could not <eos> something <eos> something and i know when time <eos> will pass by slow <eos> without my heart <eos> what can i do <eos> youre in the halls <eos> the bell gives way to a larger swell <eos> without my heart <eos> what can i do oh <eos> wroclai <eos> and we grow fat <eos> on the charms of our idle dreary days <eos> seen the shadows grow <eos> see an ominous display <eos> with no alarm <eos> could we say wed have expected this way <eos> under stars have died <eos> give incent to play <eos> wroclai instrumental <eos> " "bratislava" is a celebratory march for the slovakian capital a sweaty sawdusted cabaret jam with gogol bordello its at moments like these his vocals placed further back in the mix that you realize the kid sounds truly authentic and captivating" <eos> pitchfork brandon stosuy may walls gone over the sea <eos> but not for me <eos> watch now all will end <eos> now all that im under a tide <eos> now im under a tide <eos> tall hair under it all <eos> much more than i once had <eos> over seas the times we had <eos> oh when the wind would blow with rain and snow <eos> were not all bad <eos> we put our feet just where they had had to go <eos> never to go <eos> the shattered soul <eos> following close but nearly twice as slow <eos> in my good times <eos> there were always golden rocks to throw <eos> at those who admit defeat too late <eos> those were our times those were our times <eos> and i will love to see that day <eos> that day is mine <eos> when she will marry me outside with the willow trees <eos> and play the songs we made <eos> they made me so <eos> and i would love to see that day <eos> her day was mine and this is the house where i <eos> i feel alone <eos> feel alone now <eos> and this is the house where i <eos> could be unknown <eos> be alone now <eos> soon the waves and i found the rolling tide <eos> soon the waves and i found the rip tide <eos> this is the house where i <eos> i feel alone <eos> feel alone now <eos> and this is the house where i <eos> could be unknown <eos> be alone now <eos> soon the waves and i found the rolling tide <eos> soon the waves and i found the rip tide gosto muito de te ver leozinho

pele tua luz tua juba and i i called through the air that night <eos> a calm sea voiced with a lie <eos> i could only smile ive been alone some time <eos> and all and all its been fine <eos> and you you had hope for me now <eos> i danced all around it somehow <eos> be fair to me i may drift a while <eos> were it up to me you know id <eos> i i called through the air that night <eos> the faults

<eos> we were closer then ive been alone some time <eos> filled you glass with gin <eos> filled your heart with pride <eos> and you you had hope for me now <eos> i danced all around it somehow <eos> be fair to me i may drift a while light a candles fire <eos> carries a good name <eos> what would you ask a campfire <eos> that scares me just the same <eos> and knew you had it all along <eos> an endless need for games <eos> dont forget a candles fire <eos> is only just a flame <eos> i had sit and from afar <eos> failed to pull my weight <eos> but you and i traveled through the fog <eos> to arrive at our front gate <eos> at night we rest beside the fire <eos> and smile upon your face <eos> just dont forget a candles fire <eos> is only just a flame <eos> if i had known <eos> that to carry on that weight <eos> it wouldnt show <eos> in the creases on your face <eos> if you should go <eos> but you carry on my weight <eos> just let it blow <eos> in the fog of bishops lane youre on in five

as a bed with a maid <eos> and i find its all our waves and raves <eos> that makes the days go on this way <eos> i heard the sad sound of words <eos> spoken from a beak of a wise old bird <eos> uptown the streets are kept afloat <eos> and that girl never leaves me alone <eos> he means well saying <eos> ive got stories of wine superb <eos> and of course my childhood forks and knives <eos> and a hospital bed where i turned my life over and over again little girl <eos> little girl <eos> watching over daddys farm <eos> from your spot in the old oak tree <eos> little girl <eos> little girl <eos> in your spot that overlooks <eos> all the flowing grains of grass and harmonies <eos> but where has papa gone <eos> where has papa gone <eos> to the coast <eos> tv dinners <eos> magazines <eos> hes gonna make it on the scene <eos> a new mercedes with a financed lease <eos> a little girl <eos> to sow the garden <eos> while hes chasing down his dreams <eos> a little late under those fake palm trees <eos> but little sallys stressed <eos> because she cant quite reach the dresser drawers or cabinets <eos> little girl <eos> little girl <eos> in your spot that overlooks <eos> she sees a thick rain and an overflowing crick <eos> man the latches <eos> ground the floor <eos> the wind is knocking at her door <eos> but shes too little for that latching job to work <eos> and out the door she flies <eos> but the wind wont stain her eyes or the collars of her dress <eos> shes with the rest <eos> of them <eos> shes with the rest <eos> of them <eos> shes with the rest <eos> now where has sally gone <eos> where has sally gone <eos> to the coast <eos> just in a different way <eos> to the coast <eos> over the atlantic bay <eos> to the coast <eos> she helps the sun each day <eos> shine over you you say that im <eos> never to keen to <eos> leave this place <eos> you say that <eos> you never wanted <eos> to hit me in the face <eos> more than right now <eos> ever before <eos> but cant you see that im only alone <eos> casting lines out to catches who can swallow my buzzics and pretend that they know what i know <eos> so youre going to town <eos> have to open my mouth <eos> and empty the contents onto the floor <eos> but im never supposed to <eos> as you take it out <eos> than im only several inches from the door <eos> hurry hurry <eos> you say as im tying my shoes <eos> your hands nervous mess up <eos> as they were tying your shoes <eos> and you slipped up and have to start new <eos> well i would never say hurry up to you <eos> but i wont open my mouth <eos> or get mad about it <eos> because thats just something that i wouldnt do <eos> youve got to open your mouth <eos> as your heading to town <eos> and empty the contents onto the floor <eos> but if im never supposed to <eos> as you would take it out <eos> than im only several inches from the door with every new day <eos> it makes me <eos> crumble up further <eos> the grating <eos> im losing myself <eos> dreaming of you <eos> and dreaming of you <eos> and dreaming of the last time i saw your face <eos> when it disappeared from the staircase <eos> you were so pleased with yourself <eos> but i tried i tried to kiss your cheek <eos> when we hugged goodbye <eos> and i tried but the lack of height <eos> made me kiss your neck instead <eos> after the street signs got hazy <eos> i stumbled the streets i was fading <eos> trying to act like i wasnt steep like i wasnt steep <eos> our backs <eos> against the glass <eos> the taxicab <eos> and unpaid tabs <eos> its hard to act like <eos> im asleep <eos> im asleep <eos> i tried to fight <eos> the morning light <eos> but it poured in <eos> through your open door <eos> and i tried <eos> and i tried <eos> to keep my eyes <eos> closed for good <eos> but i opened them before you did <eos> before you did <eos> before you did doll <eos> before you did doll <eos> before before <eos> our backs against the glass <eos> the taxicab <eos> and unpaid tabs <eos> its hard to act like im asleep <eos> im asleep <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling im falling <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling asleep <eos> im falling im falling im falling <eos> im falling out of you <eos> im falling out of you <eos> im falling out of you i am human i am changing <eos> im growing further from myself <eos> and above all else i find i am grateful <eos> to the one who gave its place <eos> the one who gave its name <eos> to the one who had no choice of living or dying <eos> and now i am convinced that life is a gift <eos> but im haunted by the voices that say <eos> get up get up get updo something <eos> get up get up get up get updo something <eos> now i wasnt here before anyone anyone <eos> youll disappear once see what you have become <eos> distance is faith and it shines like a star <eos> that you see in the day because it hurts in your heart <eos> now this isnt right yes i know its not natural <eos> you want to help me because im a disaster <eos> the feeling is mutual ill agree <eos> driving you safely away from me <eos> oh i am human <eos> the change is coming and i keep on running <eos> i am human <eos> the change its coming and i keep on running <eos> so you say what you wanted to say <eos> and do as you wanted to do <eos> pray as i know that you pray <eos> let the distance sink in you <eos> could you know where i was from the game <eos> heaven does not descend <eos> you will know yourself <eos> now i am human <eos> the change is coming and i keep on running <eos> i am human <eos> the change its coming and i keep on running <eos> all i want waits in windows <eos> where nothing falls apart enough <eos> and it goes on and on <eos> braving darkness <eos> where nothings what it seems enough here i am looking back again <eos> cant seem to finish what i start <eos> revisions of progress disturbing my heart <eos> another empty page is turned <eos> another lesson failed to learn <eos> and one more gets by me if i sink lower i will drown <eos> i know i cant stop this <eos> it is beyond me <eos> and i dont want to lose this <eos> it has become meshaded in sound <eos> here i am looking back again <eos> cant seem to finish what i start <eos> revisions of progress disturbing my heart <eos> another empty page is turned <eos> another lesson failed to learn <eos> and one more gets by me if i sink lower i will drown <eos> and i know i cant stop this im not enough <eos> it is beyond me reaching far above <eos> and i dont want to lose this no not again <eos> it has become meshaded in sound walking in circles from the center never thinking twice <eos> one day ill ask you if theres confidence in my stride <eos> for unknown reasons i have needed this to stay alive <eos> one day youll show me that i try too hard to survive <eos> since the beginning ive been open to some good advice <eos> its hard to tell the difference so hard to tell the difference <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> and where our time was bound to end <eos> our lives will just begin <eos> ill say it slow just so you know that i <eos> im on your side the side you chose to fight <eos> i heard the sound that brought you down and out <eos> it fell between a broken line somehow <eos> this loss cancelled love entirely <eos> it wont be long not for you to see <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> and where our time was bound to end <eos> our lives begin <eos> and its enough for us to gather speed <eos> its just enough enough for me <eos> walking in circles from the center never thinking twice <eos> one day ill ask you if theres confidence in my stride <eos> for unknown reasons i have needed this to stay alive <eos> its hard to tell the difference <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> one day ill wake up <eos> and where our time was bound to end <eos> our lives begin <eos> its not enough for us to gather speed <eos> its not enough never for me heads or tails time to choose <eos> what else is left to lose what else is right to gain <eos> compromise for the man our singles in your hand <eos> but deaf ears will stand in our way <eos> in the clear blue sky of my disease <eos> endles possibilities shine more like stars than the sun <eos> and in the words of love "i dont care" <eos> do your best to interfere you are not in control <eos> we are infinite and fully operational <eos> possibilities revealing so much more to me <eos> true or false take a guess <eos> you rely on ignorance your crutch is made out of gold <eos> must be nice worryfree <eos> plenty of security or so thats what ive been told <eos> in the clear blue sky of my disease <eos> something tries to signal me "get out while youre still young" <eos> but in the words of love "its too late" <eos> im finally warming up to fate i am not in control <eos> we are infinite and fully operational <eos> possibilities revealing so much more to me <eos> imagine life was given to you <eos> before the moment you opened your eyes <eos> would you find purpose <eos> in trusting your path to a guide <eos> we are infinite and fully operational <eos> possibilities revealing so much more to me who knows you better than your own device <eos> programmed and set to repeat a silent film <eos> projecting image through light <eos> our cells have burned from attention <eos> and we almost survive <eos> we almost survive <eos> and we almost survive through it <eos> who knows you better than your own device <eos> programmed and set to repeat a silent

yourself out let yourself out x <eos> go outside let yourself out x <eos> when i am empty please dispose of me properly x <eos> go outside let yourself out x all my fathers love me <eos> it always takes my breath <eos> there is nothing worth desire in this head <eos> and without my minds desire <eos> there is nothing left <eos> i promised you it wont be longill be back again <eos> staring in a mirror reflecting a good friend <eos> the memory of which i view is not in my head <eos> because standing in that mirror is the ghost of a good friend <eos> with promises of empty spireshere we go again <eos> is this the last of everything <eos> ive counted all of my blessings <eos> and with respect for both of you <eos> one is more than half of two <eos> lately ive been paranoid <eos> simple pleasures bring no joy <eos> in fact i think it frightens me <eos> to be reduced to this degree <eos> and im staring in a mirror reflecting a good friend <eos> the memory of which i view is not in my head <eos> because standing in that mirror is the ghost of a good friend <eos> with promises of empty spireshere we go again its a mild relief the distance <eos> from the soul to a pure infinity <eos> something less of a past condition <eos> something more than a dream <eos> effect this mood with abandon <eos> split it right from the seam <eos> nod your head as you walk away <eos> knowing youre never the same <eos> oh my god shouldve guessed <eos> this interest takes its root from the center of gravity <eos> to the east from the west ive shifted <eos> but the journey is long in front of me <eos> who are you to explain it this interest <eos> it will only confuse you <eos> now that weve come to an understanding <eos> not that we both agree <eos> the beast that smiles upon your face will turn <eos> as it once turned from me <eos> dont stop at the ocean <eos> dont stop at the sea <eos> dont let your imagination <eos> hold you from capturing yourself a dream <eos> effect this mood with abandon <eos> split it right from the seam <eos> and nod your head as you walk away <eos> knowing youre never the same <eos> dont stop at the ocean <eos> dont stop at the sea <eos> dont let your imagination <eos> hold you from a dream whose taming ways have brought us here <eos> not a single one of us was built tonguetied with too much patience <eos> let not the focused stand as fast as the ones <eos> who by their own misfortunes drop like bombs from heavy eyelids <eos> give me a purpose and ill blow it to hell <eos> give me a reason why i shouldnt care <eos> give me loose ends ill tie them into the ground ty <eos> i could have been there i should have been there <eos> but thats no reason to mark you under a stone <eos> thats no reason for you to die alone <eos> thats no reason im standing here at all <eos> that same old laugh you cant hold back <eos> that same dark glimmer in your eye <eos> let me come home just once more find you sitting on my porch <eos> where we had spent so little time before <eos> give me a purpose watch me blow it to hell <eos> give me one reason why i shouldnt care <eos> and give me loose ends ill pull him up from the ground ty <eos> cause i should have been there i could have been there <eos> but thats no reason to mark you under a stone <eos> thats no reason for you to die alone <eos> thats no reason im standing here at all <eos> im standing here at all <eos> ty <eos> that same old laugh you cant hold back <eos> that same dark glimmer in your eye observing emotionless <eos> and my stale eyes wander <eos> im seeing a calm distance <eos> in the midst of all of this <eos> dont stop your own love <eos> your own love was fine <eos> and im waiting for you <eos> do i detect just a hint <eos> of loneliness or is that guilt <eos> you see im convinced your life aint shit <eos> how did you ever find the nerve to say "its for the best" <eos> did that really cross your mind <eos> dont stop your own love <eos> your own love was mine <eos> feel something feel while theres time the thread of inner rhythm is selfdirecting <eos> i think were standing too close now <eos> the thought has overtaken im seeking balance <eos> for theres a reason to start now <eos> three stays in her eye <eos> nine rests by my sideon my side <eos> increasing oh so quickly she is sinking into my chest <eos> forcing the air out sending me into a calm distress <eos> but as shes breathing we are breathing and our pulses connect <eos> we breathe in silence in the lightness of a new consciousness <eos> three stays in her eye <eos> nine rests by my side <eos> and a three stays in her eye <eos> while a nine rests by my sideon my side <eos> the thread of inner rhythm is selfdirecting <eos> i think were standing too close now <eos> the thread of inner rhythm is selfdirecting <eos> i think were standing too close <eos> herei dont want to go i was into questions and you gave me the answers <eos> answer all the questions for the cheaters and guessers <eos> probably not the best advice id give you <eos> we were pointed to the path and told not to worry <eos> well probably be confronted but well stick to the story <eos> kicking at the dirt and the rocks and the bad news <eos> so lets take it to the edge of the next town over <eos> theres a distance we can measure but its better not to <eos> and if anything should happen to me dont you stop <eos> you just make it to the edge of the next town over <eos> repeat <eos> heading down the hatch of the orchid station <eos> who are we to stop ben <eos> as theyre moving through the air to an unknown island

non si puã² ignorare <eos> la voce che dice che oltre le stelle <eos> cã¨ un posto migliore <eos> un giorno qualunque ti viene la voglia <eos> di andare a vedere di andare a scoprire se ã¨ vero <eos> che non sei soltanto una scatola vuota <eos> o lultima ruota del carro piã¹ grande che cã¨ <eos> ma chiedilo a kurt cobain <eos> come ci si sente a stare sopra a un piedistallo <eos> e a non cadere

migliore <eos> e proprio quel giorno ti viene la voglia <eos> di andare a vedere di andare a scoprire se ã¨ vero <eos> che il senso profondo di tutte le cose <eos> lo puoi ritrovare soltanto guardandoti in fondo <eos> ma chiedilo a kurt cobain <eos> come ci si sente a stare sopra a un piedistallo <eos> e a non cadere <eos> chiedilo a marilyn <eos> quanto lapparenza inganna <eos> e quanto ci si puã² sentire soli <eos> e non provare piã¹ niente <eos> non provare piã¹ niente <eos> e non avere piã¹ niente <eos> da dire <eos> vivere come sognare <eos> ci si puã² riuscire spegnendo la luce <eos> e tornando a dormire when the rest of the world is asleep <eos> do you remember that night when you and me <eos> pulled down the steeple of ash <eos> the rain was coming down i was filthy and black <eos> sometimes i feel that my time <eos> on earth is sorta defined <eos> and my life oh its calling me <eos> and my life oh its calling me <eos> and i wonder what else it could be <eos> there are times when i see and dont see <eos> sometimes i feel that im changed <eos> by those women on the hill in the rain <eos> in this vision of earthly decay <eos> i see that time will bear us all away <eos> but im sad i wont be here to see it fade <eos> and my life oh its calling me <eos> and my life oh its calling me <eos> and my life oh its calling me searching for reasons against truth <eos> withholding blossom against the bloom <eos> i seek the golden somewhere for me <eos> who told the prophets where to find <eos> their dying orders hung dry on the line <eos> i seek that symbol but it dont seek me <eos> the slow wont beat the fast <eos> theres no going back <eos> the heart only beats intact <eos> <eos> is feeling black <eos> i saw the measure pour to fill the cup <eos> and what had spilled out someone called it love <eos> we want the measure not the flood <eos> so let the day break and the night stand still <eos> let the quaker try to have his fill <eos> no crying wolf now not for me <eos> time it moves right along <eos> just another selfish song <eos> though the years have come and gone <eos> <eos> <eos> is painted black there is a place where she smiles a lot <eos> in the darkened corner of a parking lot <eos> before men walked upon the moon <eos> when you played the swinging doors of a lonely saloon <eos> she waits for me there <eos> there is a place where she still goes <eos> in the wintery night where her story flows <eos> before we all sold our souls for money <eos> and the jokes we told were still considered funny <eos> she waits for me there <eos> in the cold hours of the morning with the wind in her hair <eos> im not going out tonight <eos> until the songs we know are all played inside <eos> and the old cars empty rust <eos> and the cd players start to gather dust <eos> somewhere only she knows <eos> in the cheap thrills of the morning <eos> with the cold spill of my woes <eos> there is a place where we are together <eos> where the mountain thyme grows around the heather <eos> before the drivethru cinema died <eos> and a truthful word replaced with one big lie <eos> she waits for me there <eos> there is a place where i last saw her <eos> with a hushed out tone and a borrowed fur <eos> just as the maps were changed <eos> i took a wrong turn looking for her golden plain <eos> she waits for me there <eos> in the cold hours of the morning with the wind in her hair <eos> there is a place and its not to be seen <eos> where the air is young and the waters clean <eos> where the juggernaut cut the sailors scar <eos> but on the moons above riding a shooting star <eos> she waits for me there its pretty hard to believe that when you get told something different <eos> now your life gets cold or something blue something borrowed <eos> if theres church bells you dont want church bells <eos> but theyre left out just like seashells now youre feeling cold <eos> youre something blue something borrowed <eos> ring ring the silent and cherished bell that flows out of the sky <eos> ill forget the memory of your kiss <eos> i thought i was your ending not some temporary guy <eos> and im something blue something borrowed something replaced <eos> its pretty hard to believe that <eos> you can keep something intact for so long until <eos> youre something blue something borrowed <eos> then the rumours flow and the rumours flow <eos> from the open sky to the undergrowth like swallows <eos> youre something blue something borrowed <eos> so open up the ventricle and close the bloody vestibule <eos> open up the mind and close the heart <eos> you wont answer my questions and i wont repeat your answer <eos> and im something blue something borrowed something replaced so take off your coat and let in all the light <eos> we can go for a walk do anything you like <eos> you could tell me all your problems set your stall lay a marker <eos> id tell you the rich stay rich but the dark wont get darker <eos> youll be sorry if you never know its what keeps us all complete <eos> if you need a friend or youre feeling low then baby stick with me <eos> times pass and fall down the darkened road <eos> i saw you walking with a note i saw you lay it on down <eos> you could of told me your mind so i could turn it around <eos> you should tell me all your problems set your stall lay a marker <eos> id tell you the rich stay rich but the dark wont get darker you say you can tell the different parts of me <eos> one a falling bird another a lonely child <eos> if its gonna be you my judge and my saviour <eos> bury me in rock just like i told you <eos> if i had a candle id light it at your end <eos> but you wont light me up not even a part of me <eos> so let the colours run my lover my friend <eos> bury me in sand right up till the end <eos> but maybe for tonight treat me like a stranger <eos> like i was never here in the wake of the danger <eos> one more time around treat me like a stranger <eos> then you wont recognize me <eos> turn me over babe turn me loose and under <eos> then you can drift away leave me to the lonely tide <eos> but im glad it was you my friend and my lover <eos> give me to the waves send me down under theres a place when i was young that i liked <eos> that place got burnt down not so long ago <eos> it never knew a name but it always looked the same <eos> i guess that place will always be my home <eos> i saw the picture of it in the paper <eos> it brought a cold hard shudder to my bones <eos> i knew the boy that died he was coldly burnt alive <eos> i guess that place will always be his home <eos> that little place i knew so long ago <eos> but i hate what it did to me <eos> im lost inside the pockets of its overcoat <eos> i never tried to go back there and see <eos> all the ash the debris and the smoke <eos> i moved away the day that i had left school <eos> i didnt stick around to make my mark <eos> i even changed my name <eos> told my family to do the same <eos> to run from that place i used to know <eos> i left for the city with my sister and mother <eos> my father stayed there working for some magazine <eos> and though our house still stands <eos> on some cursed and uneven land <eos> i guess its somewhere in the inbetween <eos> its never in some crazy place where you lose your face <eos> its in the peaks and cracks of the unnoticed shade <eos> so when you kick your feet down some forgotten street <eos> its where it all floods back but its too late to take <eos> my father wrote the story down in his letters <eos> a spark had chased the wind down to the town below <eos> no theres nothing left for me <eos> since i went and got myself free <eos> i guess that place will always be my home <eos> that little place i knew so long ago break the branch upon the willow <eos> no bird will want to sing today <eos> cut loose the boats down in the boathouse <eos> weve never seen such strange old days <eos> tell the lost that no ones looking <eos> tell the found that no one cares <eos> no one can ever find the answers <eos> weve never seen such strange old days <eos> so long to thinking the crowd will travel well <eos> weve unchained a monster <eos> and it left me feeling unwell <eos> so long to knowing the past is buried still <eos> under a hard place in an empty wishing well <eos> no ones coming for the helpless <eos> so come and quickly help yourself <eos> go and sell yourself to jesus <eos> god insists upon that sale <eos> people are whistling to the sirens <eos> they clap their hands to a defeat <eos> i saw a headless person crying <eos> weve never seen such strange old days theres a man out there talking speaking in tongues <eos> losing his hair bleeding gums <eos> saying things about my sister things about their son <eos> if he dont stop soon im gonna kill someone <eos> hes got eyes of black and a hide of green <eos> throwing out lines like a submachine <eos> dont know why or what he really means <eos> because he hasnt been there and he hasnt ever seen <eos> he says he was a soldier he told me that he served <eos> but he never left the barracks only a reserve <eos> now he making off with another racist word <eos> i think he lost the war but won the purge <eos> take him down some take him down some <eos> take him down some take him down some <eos> now hes fighting for justice and praying to god <eos> while he misspells his name and keeps his fingers crossed <eos> everybody knows gods been dead since <eos> you cant bridge the gap for the underneath <eos> he has four babies with four different girls <eos> he has four houses he has four worlds <eos> but he has no money <eos> though hes wearing someones pearls <eos> and hell take from your pockets and fumble their curls <eos> in his son i cant see his fathers eyes <eos> because the boy is an angel the boy doesnt lie <eos> though hes still one of his lowly four <eos> his eyes may run but his blood wont pour <eos> he was bred from the devil bred just to take <eos> where they screw up their own in the belly of a lake <eos> who the hell takes a baby to a dead mans wake <eos> when the dead mans a racist the dead mans a snake <eos> im gonna wake up in the morning and get myself a gun <eos> not to fire at anybody just to keep him on the run <eos> and then drive in the screw and rust it in the sun <eos> like he did to me like he does to everyone i never found out what she never gave me anything <eos> was i just here to pass the time cold hearted lover of mine <eos> i want her to turn and see this lonely shadow walking with you <eos> by shape of poor design cold hearted lover of mine <eos> she has nothing left to show nothing left to give me <eos> these chains are old and her arms too weak <eos> her lips too dry to kiss me <eos> wanting to hang my line cold hearted lover of mine <eos> though summers heat is long her road is long and cold <eos> there is no sentence to fit her crime <eos> and no time to let the wisdom age <eos> these falling beams of light they colour my sleepless eyes <eos> but she falls beneath that line cold hearted lover of mine <eos> she dont think shes wrong she just thinks it easy <eos> somebody let her know that i shouldnt be the one <eos> to feel as though im empty <eos> dont drag me down to the waters edge to see it dry beneath me <eos> with no money left to pay her fine cold hearted lover of mine <eos> i guess shell drink my blood like wine cold hearted lover of mine i spent many days on the back of this haze <eos> with a mind to tell you you were wrong <eos> its not that i was right but the will of the fight <eos> drew you in when you thought i had gone <eos> hideaway its your soul to display <eos> and keep the words in your head <eos> keep from me all you wanted to be <eos> only you will have to regret <eos> everyone speaks of you with your foot on the pew <eos> so i can see that you are what you are <eos> but you came from inside with some tears round your eyes <eos> not for me just because you felt down <eos> hideaway its your soul to display <eos> and keep your ear to the ground <eos> keep from me all you wanted to be <eos> its you whos wearing the crown <eos> its a long beating road to get back to the start <eos> still you cant change whats already done <eos> so go lie awake at night and remember the trite <eos> senseless words behind the harm that youve done <eos> only you will have to regret beyond this place beyond the cafes and the choirs <eos> lies the death of me <eos> where the adults dont see the boards start to creak <eos> down this lonesome street <eos> at the end of school we start the new rule <eos> when the teachers leave <eos> we dont see the chapel we dont see the city <eos> we gave away our dreams <eos> carry me far beyond this town <eos> before im laid out in the ground for all of you to see <eos> let me see that all of this is stone and i shouldnt feel alone <eos> and i shouldnt have to be <eos> the song the kids sing <eos> the kids shoot the wall speaking in that loose drawl <eos> just in front of me <eos> i want to rant and sing but what good would it bring to the factory <eos> i want to turn this around <eos> but im wedged in the crack with the hollow seed <eos> who planted this madness who planted this sadness all around me <eos> im not from this town im from another old town far to the east <eos> its close to my brother its close to my father its inside of me my day is death <eos> my night is dark <eos> my love wont answer the call <eos> with the rain like steel upon my face <eos> my heart is certain to fall <eos> now im tired of sins corrupting me <eos> and the fever turning me in <eos> i dont know where i am headed to <eos> but at least i know where ive been <eos> my mouth is dry and i cannot speak <eos> ive lost all faith in you <eos> i admit ive lost a few <eos> its like my words against the wind <eos> so im heading down to that long lost place <eos> where the light wont bounce off the floor <eos> and as the world turns to stare at me <eos> my footsteps head straight to the door <eos> so im alone again in this lonely place <eos> with no shadow at my side <eos> my head is littered with your lust <eos> and its cold and its rancid outside <eos> and im outside <eos> my mouth is dry and i cannot speak <eos> ive lost all faith in you <eos> i admit ive lost a few <eos> its like my words against the wind <eos> i cant take this love and its pulling me in <eos> im tied to the floor and im cut at the seams <eos> im crazy in love and im crazy to die <eos> im lost to this world and i dont know why <eos> oh and i dont know why <eos> cause my mouth is dry and i cannot speak <eos> ive lost all faith in you <eos> i admit ive lost a few <eos> its like my words against the wind <eos> and ive been down for twelve halfdays <eos> and ive kinda hit the floor <eos> im reaching for something more <eos> its like my words against the wind <eos> im against the wind <eos> im against the wind now <eos> against the wind <eos> against the wind <eos> oh im against the wind <eos> oh im against the wind now running through chairs and rows sizing up the meaning <eos> smiles for the camera and cries her pot was always steaming <eos> but he wont ask her again for to him she is lumber <eos> storms on that horizon have blown her lips rest on the tumbler <eos> she decides to head down below to omit the danger <eos> flowers in her dressing room again and all from a stranger <eos> to bite the bullet and mourn would take too much pain <eos> shes leaving to do it all on her own and out in the street rain <eos> now that youre out on your own <eos> for the needs you once had they have grown <eos> the lights and applause werent your own and will go away <eos> you pulled your own weight all the same <eos> with your hunger your voice and a chain <eos> your talent was never the fame <eos> this will all go away <eos> there is nothing more pure than love you said in a drunken fling <eos> three years later youre back with your mother and you eat what she brings <eos> youre making your living in bars and tied to street corners <eos> youre a hit with the junkies and cleaners and one for the mourners <eos> your voice never clutches at straws you could bury the morning <eos> but things were never the same after you had left without hearing fair warning <eos> things shouldnt have turned out this way not even in your deepest fears <eos> you cant ever go back to the crowds and to the good old years <eos> now that youre out on your own <eos> for the needs you once had they have grown <eos> the lights and applause werent your own and will go away <eos> you pulled your own weight all the same <eos> with your hunger your voice and a chain <eos> your talent was never the fame <eos> this will all go away <eos> this will all go away <eos> this will all go away my day is death <eos> my night is dark <eos> my love wont answer the call <eos> with the rain like steel upon my face <eos> my heart is certain to fall <eos> now im tired of sins corrupting me <eos> and the fever turning me in <eos> i dont know where i am headed to <eos> but at least i know where ive been <eos> my mouth is dry and i cannot speak

<eos> against the wind <eos> against the wind <eos> oh im against the wind <eos> oh im against the wind now you got your ways and i got mine <eos> you got your own ways of spending time <eos> the stars are falling all around your dress <eos> the constellations point to your own sweet mess <eos> you need to suffer well i suffer too <eos> i keep it inside and far from you <eos> you throw it around and you see what sticks <eos> im covered head to foot in your cold antics <eos> you got your own ways that comfort <eos> that involve yourself and my eldest brother <eos> you take it on yourself you take it on yourself <eos> and me to find my place in your arms <eos> and its a cold cold turn <eos> just a cold cold turn in your way <eos> youre first to judge and last to lead <eos> youre last to act out and first to feed <eos> you still stand when you see me kneel <eos> and youre not concerned about the way i feel lay me down easy i know ive done wrong <eos> i was out in the desert and planting head stones <eos> you bought it i stammered my way around love <eos> i kindled the fires that burnt the embers above <eos> lay me down ready with a sympathy wind <eos> if i dont start to feel better i may do it all again <eos> and its the only way of making you talk <eos> for its the only way of making you talk <eos> dont mention the scandal it pulls me in two <eos> the lies i kept with me and the truth that you threw <eos> im heady with darkness dont perch on my throne <eos> i never asked for your distance or for you to leave me alone i walked home empty with a sultry dream <eos> i tossed a coin onto the icy pond <eos> i tripped and fell upon the icy curve <eos> the road is short but the rivers long <eos> i drew my eye onto a womans smile <eos> told her man that i was running her down <eos> we told his friend that i was speaking out <eos> so they put me into the ground <eos> on and on they will go <eos> destroying me cruelly <eos> taking off all my my clothes <eos> way back in the day <eos> turn me on upside down <eos> screaming in laughter <eos> i was screaming in pain <eos> i didnt want to be there <eos> they found me covered in it head to toe <eos> wild and rived like some bound up ghost <eos> and any day i will lose the fight <eos> but it would hurt my family the most <eos> she was heavy and her voice were grim <eos> a shaven headcase with a smile turned foul <eos> who didnt know that they were bad and wrong <eos> the road is short but the rivers long <eos> on and on they will go <eos> destroying me cruelly <eos> taken off all my my clothes <eos> way back in the day <eos> turn me on upside down <eos> screaming in anger <eos> i was screaming in pain <eos> i didnt want to be there <eos> there turns themselves like some western film <eos> theres another highway that they cant walk down <eos> a sailing over on a misty gorge <eos> the road is short but the rivers long your coarse bloody veins are eating away theyre killing me <eos> and now if she stays im running away from what i need <eos> now that im older now she wont grow older with me <eos> she wont leave and i wont go since none of us here will ever show <eos> she wont ask and i wont say no one here is ever gonna run away <eos> the time is hurried the night is heading down to the sea <eos> my planted feet are pillars of weight only she can free <eos> now that im older now she wont grow older with me <eos> her prism is open my bounty is bought we hold the keys she wears silver and gold in case she gets old <eos> purple and gray to pull her astray <eos> her room it is red <eos> the color of her head <eos> her beige isnt white <eos> that she drags through the night <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green cloth the dagger that scantily clad her <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green to remind her ill always be with her <eos> she wears violet and pink <eos> to vouch for the stink <eos> of the rasp of the gutter <eos> and all hallows clutter <eos> yellow and twine <eos> to soften the lime <eos> of her sunday best <eos> her flowered church dress <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green cloth the dagger that scantily clad her <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green to remind her ill always be with her <eos> black for the day <eos> they pull her away <eos> dapple for her horses <eos> her cold cuts and torches <eos> cream keeps her strong <eos> when a man sings his song <eos> plumgives her reason <eos> when hes fitting for treason <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green cloth the dagger that scantily clad her <eos> she wears green oh green <eos> green to remind her ill always be with her <eos> green to remind her im laying beside her i lost my english soul <eos> pulling out the corpse <eos> sheltering in the trenches again <eos> crying for a lose <eos> i let my arms down <eos> walked away in a trance <eos> theres parts of me layer out <eos> all over france <eos> so i took my last waltz <eos> got caught up in the wire <eos> wrote a letter for my love <eos> as i head from the fire <eos> an old solider carried me <eos> way to the coast bathe my wounds in the sea <eos> im in the hands of a ghost im in the hands of a ghost <eos> their boats came on in <eos> i tried to run away <eos> i got taken half by the throat <eos> in the burning light of day <eos> set down with the iron punch <eos> so broken and alone <eos> left my blood on the beach for the tide to take me home <eos> these wounds that i shed inside <eos> two years old <eos> so my girl she gave up <eos> she had taken me for dead <eos> she had forgot all her promises and everything she said <eos> living in the darkest dream <eos> i rose up in the cold <eos> these wounds that i have outside <eos> are two years old <eos> these wounds that i have outside <eos> are two years old <eos> two years old <eos> living in the past <eos> living by the mile i toke the same walk down <eos> as i did as a child <eos> the flags flew for a man <eos> unaware of the fate no one saw me walk down on my very last parade <eos> so thoughts turn to dust <eos> as i headed for the mound <eos> i strayed up the part waiting for the count <eos> living in the darkest dream so broken and all alone <eos> these pain that i have inside is two years old <eos> these scars that i have inside are more than two years old <eos> these pain that i have inside is two years old <eos> these scars that i have inside are more than two years old <eos> is more than two years <eos> is more than two years <eos> is more than two years <eos> is more than two years <eos> is more than two years now go to sleep close your eyes <eos> until the world doesnt turn <eos> ill be here right by your side <eos> just as long as you heal <eos> youve been away but so have i <eos> but the change is in our hearts <eos> drums may beat kings may fall <eos> the blood dont wash off your clothes <eos> you may feel the roads are a better way to go <eos> you may feel like you havent got a place to call home <eos> and the time is all you when you sleep <eos> oh darling <eos> every face around will make you weep your not alone <eos> oh its time to lay down where you play <eos> ill be the one to watch you lay <eos> ill be the one to watch you lay <eos> someday ill find you pure of heart <eos> its easy on your core <eos> beyond yourself and in your mind <eos> ill flutter through your garden <eos> you come for me like i came for you <eos> and carry me home to my bed and i see papers and papers <eos> stacked up in formation <eos> that mean much before <eos> theyre lining the fire <eos> as the bottomless heat goes <eos> to harness your anger <eos> your blood and <eos> your deepest desire <eos> because theres no truth stolen <eos> thats been ever brought forward <eos> by the minds of the writers <eos> looking face down on the gutter <eos> cause this worlds full of thinkers <eos> and suffragette speakers <eos> who deny that they ever wear a dress <eos> oh this god forsaken town is in a mess <eos> and all the truths been let out loose <eos> is desperate to amuse <eos> as it grabs you by the throat <eos> and strings out all the times youve used <eos> but now you dont belong <eos> you whisper when you speak <eos> you turn yourself to nighttime <eos> youre trying to find your feet <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord lord <eos> run <eos> lord just let me run <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord lord <eos> lord just let me run <eos> but as the morning awakens <eos> that light sends a shudder <eos> the twist of hope that helped you down <eos> is left to rest and stir <eos> you back down a hallway <eos> to flourish the darkness <eos> and fool yourself <eos> you did it all for her <eos> and him and her <eos> and all the truths been let out loose <eos> is desperate to amuse <eos> as it grabs you by the throat <eos> and strings out all the times youve used <eos> but now you dont belong <eos> you whisper when you speak <eos> you turn yourself to nighttime <eos> and youre trying to find your feet <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord lord <eos> run <eos> lord just let me run <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord lord <eos> lord just let me run <eos> but ive seen your face before <eos> rich boy playing poor <eos> ravaging the whores <eos> ignoring constant calls <eos> now you dont belong <eos> you whisper when you speak <eos> you turn yourself to nighttime <eos> youre trying to find your feet <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord lord <eos> run <eos> lord just let me run <eos> so let me run lord <eos> lord lord <eos> lord just let me run youre too young to know any way out and you were drinking long before <eos> anyone had time to show <eos> no one knew this day was sad for thinking but then a fading trend and <eos> everybody really wants to know <eos> we have tough breaks we have people to face we have time <eos> before you have to feel that again <eos> we have fire on our burnt skin and it will heal <eos> before you have to feel that again <eos> i will help you mend <eos> no one saw the statue in the road or that the falling wind was cold <eos> and you didnt tell them all you had seen <eos> a truer mark of you would only hide in me <eos> and i still couldnt set you free <eos> or pull the only person back you had been <eos> theres nothing like the lonely feeling of falling <eos> but i will be pulling you back <eos> theres nothing like the lonely feeling of mourning <eos> i wont let it find me again guns firing on a ridge down onto a quiet town <eos> wind bellows up smoke to the breakdown in the blood soaked dawn <eos> me and my friend we headed up to where they had set up <eos> the shells dug up the sand as they let up <eos> he shot two and i held them down <eos> we chased them off early we held the sway what i mean to say <eos> is they lost their way and theyre out there now in the firing dark <eos> and i hear them and i think i see them coming <eos> were waiting were hiding theyre running <eos> and well stay here until the dawn <eos> later on we dreamt it was over but we saw the drover <eos> in the middle they were ducking for cover so we laid back down <eos> they must of felt the coming of shadow and they were all aglow <eos> near our burrow and in the moon light we shot them down well the radio was blasting another day old tune <eos> my mother left me for a war for an old dragoon <eos> the streets were burnt no one cried no one made a sound <eos> my friends waited by the wayside until the end of the day <eos> the pipes burst in the road and soaked our way <eos> we followed that path until we came to our home <eos> well her diamonds twinkle fast her time dont move <eos> she can turn inside the evening <eos> shes got nothing to prove <eos> she comes she comes to the light <eos> no one was speaking except the sound of an alarm <eos> it kept me up for an hour lying in her arms <eos> and she comforts me and tells me "lay your head" sleeping through the daytime like a child <eos> up right through the night time running wild <eos> thinking i will never be as strong as the day is long <eos> i saw the coward day that sunk the sun <eos> hiding in the house where we belong <eos> i saw the blood flow red and it ran long <eos> and all my brothers <eos> its a swift turning clock we travel on <eos> from boy to man from four to one <eos> some of us who rest and grow <eos> dont need to know dont need to know <eos> i still hear them all summer long <eos> will they let me join them one day <eos> i still hear them all summer long <eos> will they turn me away <eos> we lost three fighting booker in virginia <eos> one came back with a body full of holes <eos> i wouldnt let my mother come and see him <eos> all bound in blood and gold <eos> its a long lonely night we gaze upon <eos> when all the stars are dead and gone <eos> the moon it shines on all our heads <eos> and to the west and to the west im walking past the close of the parade <eos> and this rain is killed by falling snow <eos> i saw you lean into the corner listening <eos> to all of them talking about what they know <eos> i dont blame you for being there <eos> but you know you didnt have to believe it <eos> two coins on the ground gently gleaming <eos> two more faces for you to believe in <eos> im so sorry for this night you say <eos> i need to leave before i lose my mind <eos> things shouldnt of turned out this way <eos> at least not tonight at least not today <eos> someone outside lit a fire to burn that soft white flesh away <eos> i saw some old friends waving to me <eos> as the crowds fell and made their way <eos> i stood there looking out for you under some cold old melting tree <eos> i saw you in your mums old car wearing the same sad look as me <eos> as the patrons set the switch of the bright lights <eos> i drank the cold bottles you bought me <eos> and fell into the colors that showed me <eos> that the lights are colder now im pale ive brought it back to winter tale <eos> so spare the ghosts around my neck <eos> the winds against the sails <eos> im shivering up a storm of roadside pines <eos> thirst shreds the ballast cold <eos> and shows the olden times <eos> im bold and sorrow thrown into the day <eos> into the barrels of the sun i turned and found a way <eos> the naked branches cut the empty air <eos> the river birds have fled away <eos> from all their wear and tear <eos> the covered surface hugs the board <eos> but keeps in the sky <eos> a childhood glimpse that keeps you warm <eos> but hangs you to dry <eos> the shameful dream the shameful face <eos> that pulls on your heart <eos> those brittle winds will keep the dawn <eos> from you at the start <eos> so bring me choirs to ease me on my way <eos> so bring me screams of organs for the day <eos> so bring me choirs to brighten all the gales <eos> so bring me screams of organs and the wails <eos> of winter tales smokes flowing from the musty pit with the breakers low <eos> and swelling coming from the orchard <eos> were losing him with all your woe from the glory you have stolen <eos> and his that you have changed <eos> you may think that no one knows <eos> but your mothers gonna reap and then shell sow <eos> youre not a duty of mine youre there to walk your own line <eos> im gonna tell people i know <eos> someway youve been altered <eos> i see the blood flow red down in the orchard <eos> the trees are bound with oil and rags <eos> the fruit lies bitten and eaten on the damp floor <eos> the wings of birds have been clipped and picked <eos> to save themselves from carrying him away <eos> is this a glimpse of your troubled mind <eos> into the barren mist of murder and seduction wait for time to turn or you calling my name again <eos> same talk with the same loose friends about calling you <eos> staying young in my mind in the windows that reflect the sun <eos> left on a moving perch singing out loud <eos> and now youre far away and nothing will ease the pain <eos> now trouble is on my parade <eos> cold on the bone from a borrowed dress <eos> and sunday mornings once more once less <eos> my words on a page and theyre ruined in ink <eos> see now youre far away and nothing will ease the pain <eos> now trouble is on my parade yesterday yesterday was good <eos> but theres time for change in the wild wood <eos> im gonna head back down to seal the quill <eos> and let the black ink merge in the landfill <eos> hear the ringing of chains as they bend and coil <eos> around the futures neck see it broil <eos> many of us will be gone dead for dreaming in the rain <eos> with all the guilt but without the pain <eos> and you can take yours and ill take mine <eos> no running away from the scene of the crime <eos> and yesterday was fine <eos> i was so in love with you <eos> with what people do to me and you <eos> yesterday yesterday but theres time for change <eos> from yesterday <eos> hes a born again fake the crowd would cheer <eos> if they could see their hands and calm their fear <eos> being led by a wishbone whose making a break <eos> nothings gonna come through for this treasured fake <eos> i read a story in a paper someone lit it on fire <eos> just a wholesome buyer but written by a liar <eos> oh yesterday yesterday wont come around <eos> and its been and gone and in this song he cut his sorrow from his flesh and banned it from his love <eos> she said i hope that it kills you <eos> he said hed give her answers when his blood dripped to the ground <eos> and from the kill <eos> she knew hed need to <eos> and the room it didnt dim to the overhead <eos> but the world is still mourning from your loss <eos> your love hes speaking empties til the death parade <eos> in the frost <eos> in the frost <eos> so please bury him deep <eos> whoa keep that man from me <eos> in the rubble and the soil <eos> he holds the key to all my toil <eos> until the day i can no longer hide <eos> and i lay down by his side <eos> and i lay down by his side <eos> the wind it shakes the mourners as they pray for a <eos> down comes the storm drowning his old faithfuls <eos> and they sing a thousand songs from the depths of bloody hell <eos> they take his soul from their handfuls <eos> and her heart it skips a beat as her senses take a sleep <eos> and the world turns so slowly to a creep <eos> they faithful kiss their crosses but their hate still spreads the disease <eos> the disease <eos> the disease <eos> so please bury him deep <eos> whoa keep that man from me <eos> in the rubble and the soil <eos> he holds the key to all my toil <eos> until the day i can no longer hide <eos> and i lay down by his side <eos> and i lay down by his side now i will run you like a threat <eos> cause my worried eyes will see again <eos> make peace with sky its rain may bring you hope <eos> but no siren will call brace your love for the fall <eos> now i will fall upon this town to call your name <eos> my sweet suffragette <eos> now i will fall upon this town to call your name <eos> my sweet suffragette my sweet mary jane <eos> my sweet mary jane <eos> shes weighted down with loss at her side <eos> shes on board a ship a ship of ghost and lost pride <eos> now say hello to fate my dear wreck this story told <eos> and if you dress my wounds ill feel your cold <eos> ill feel your cold <eos> now i will fall upon this town to call your name

mary jane <eos> my sweet mary jane the night it rests like a hammerblow and breaks the morning it brings <eos> the mad men are down on the crypt floor sleeping through there favours and sins <eos> i trained myself to be hardened and greet the bird like the day <eos> i soared to greet lusty gamblings and drenched myself in the dusk where they lay <eos> i exchanged the dark for the darkness and hung the belt from the wing <eos> so the traitors may part with there malice but ill remember everything <eos> i stood up and danced round the heckles and planted the leaf from the book <eos> i admit i love my romances the blackbird the wren the rook <eos> the church house wont harbour the coffins but the docks they wittle there ships <eos> to the pleasure the feast and the memory and the soar of kissing her lips <eos> i gave up myself to the dawning of the morning bird in first flight <eos> i thought i ran the road of the pauper <eos> i lost it all in the night <eos> i lost it all in the night heaven is a place where people die pretty <eos> skies dont lie and theres cash in the kitty <eos> running from the rocks theres water for the lips <eos> to ease your mouth and bathe your fist

theres nothing in the sun who give it light <eos> theres nothing like a ship to help me float <eos> or the docks that keep me awake a night <eos> time is gonna roll if we stand still <eos> earth is gonna move if we lie down <eos> theres nothing like a ship to help me float <eos> or tidal wave to help me drown <eos> but ill wait for you here <eos> since you cannot stand in fear <eos> and if ive left or if im gone <eos> these boats will take you home <eos> i shredded up the copies of your bible <eos> i had the words in my head <eos> noah had the flood and you had your demons <eos> everyones

you drown <eos> but ill wait for you here <eos> since you cannot stand in fear <eos> and if ive left or if im gone <eos> these boats will take you home <eos> but ill wait for you here <eos> since you

darkness again <eos> and im bound to walk the darkness again <eos> and im bound to walk the darkness again devil moon shows its face too soon at a hopeless time <eos> fast old road shut down in the winter cold at a quiet time <eos> threw out my back tending another crack on the picket line <eos> the sweetest wind blows through my darlings clothes when im inside <eos> i can feel the seasons change like im to blame <eos> my industry has stretched to the pieces ive been holding <eos> for the devil moon has eclipsed all i see eclipsed all i see <eos> and under its lights it may prove to be

the graves of the milky milky cradle <eos> his tears have turned to poppies <eos> a shimmer in the midnight <eos> a flower in the twilight <eos> a flower in the twilight <eos> and our screaming <eos> is in his screaming <eos> our screaming in the willow <eos> they took him to the gallows <eos> he fought them all the way though <eos> and when they asked us how we knew his name <eos> we died just before him <eos> our eyes are in the flowers <eos> our hands are in the branches <eos> our voices in the breezes <eos> and our screaming <eos> is in his screaming <eos> our screaming in the willow tree <eos> were waiting by the willow <eos> our milky milky cradle <eos> our lockets long have rusted <eos> his picture worn and weathered <eos> our hair is in the garden <eos> the roses in our toeses <eos> our heart are in the blossoms <eos> our eyes are in the branches <eos> and our screaming <eos> is in his screaming <eos> our screaming in the willow tree he draws near the periphery <eos> in

worms weave a ring where fairies square dance <eos> queens and kings fairies weave wigs with eyelash <eos> trance music makes the fairies dance <eos> from the caves of snail shells <eos> echoes the mutter medieval spells <eos> mystery flows her wicked river <eos> of thorn and blade and silver sliver <eos> bending round the clover fields <eos> their sapling stems dont break but yield <eos> her pain inflicts no arguments <eos> must learn to sway and unarrange <eos> as earth she makes her final passage <eos> after humans long have ravaged <eos> vanished with all maps for motion <eos> upward angels last devotion <eos> one by one escort us home <eos> to leave the elementals free to roam <eos> to bathe in the last of oceans foam <eos> to beach comb the nuclear debris <eos> our plastic toys and our metal trees <eos> on the perfect day youll find the breeze <eos> once blew the pollen the feet of bees <eos> now cry the stars when upon the earth <eos> their gaze might rest a nostalgic burst <eos> a lament be heard through all the cosmos <eos> of the dying planet with fallen foes in her mourning <eos> in her grave <eos> dont you miss the way <eos> that she brushed her heavy hair <eos> oh la la la la la <eos> acid burned face clowny tear smile <eos> shes the one who made you wild <eos> she made you question all your answers <eos> made you beg for her forgiveness <eos> baby girl dont cry <eos> mommas gonna buy you a glass eye <eos> and it will glimmer like starlight <eos> shes got no reservations <eos> aint got no place to be <eos> he graveyards in the backyard <eos> where the

sped <eos> sped round every corner <eos> calling out his name <eos> shot a rabbit from the back seat window <eos> sat and watched the summer corn grow <eos> ate ice cream in a desert dream <eos> and got lost in fathers singing <eos> too hot inside <eos> too hot outside <eos> lazy days when i said lets go for a ride <eos> wed sail on spirit lake <eos> me my pappy and his lemonade <eos> tim and tina were my parents names <eos> they got engaged <eos> they were inflamed <eos> seduced by the light of butterflies <eos> how they shimmer how they glimmer <eos> those butterflies <eos> we seven kids <eos> we almost died <eos> nearly put to death <eos> by lightening strikes <eos> instead there was hot pink <eos> flashes in the sky <eos> we climbed the rocks in snow and rain <eos> in search of magic powers <eos> to heal our mothers pain they call her smokey taboo <eos> i got your name tattooed <eos> high like a helium balloon <eos> midnight to noon <eos> im a desert child <eos> and mountains make me nauseous <eos> i like to look up wild at an infinite sky <eos> twinkling with diamonds <eos> its true i get depressed in fancy hotel rooms <eos> undressed with nothing to flaunt but my loneliness <eos> thinking of the night song of your hair <eos> premature as evening falls it calls to me <eos> interrupted by the sirens in the street <eos> cristal heaven cristal heaven <eos> cristal heaven cristal heaven <eos> somedays youre like an anchor on my heart <eos> they say that stolen water tastes sweet <eos> more like rotten milk and rancid meat to me <eos> i prefers when it is free <eos> like looking at the stars <eos> dont need no fancy cars <eos> when we first <eos> our kisses sparked <eos> yeah im afraid of sharks <eos> but not the dark i love you <eos> i cried on your mothers shoulder <eos> like a broken hearted soldier <eos> she knew and i knew <eos> what all the tears were for <eos> weary exhausted flames of light <eos> trinitys crying in heaven worm souls flutter <eos> they flutter by with rosaries <eos> dangling from their necks <eos> german shepherds guide by nightfall <eos> little kinder <eos> little kinder dressed in starlight <eos> inside i feel like <eos> like im crying besides a tree <eos> im watching myself like an old tv <eos> im watching myself like an old movie on color tv <eos> when people whisper in portuguese <eos> its just as mysterious <eos> and the stubble on his face <eos> it hurt me when <eos> when we fell onto each others faces <eos> dawn retraces heart ached patterns across grey oceans <eos> windows brighten up the room <eos> and one could cast a smooth worn lovers stone <eos> worn smooth from days of fertile deliberation <eos> dawn retraces heart ached patterns across grey oceans <eos> worn smooth from days of fertile deliberation the worlds rose in the night and prayed <eos> people kissed kissed and hugged one last time <eos> saying what have we done for two thousand years <eos> the end it has begun <eos> should i let my mind run <eos> for a scrap of kettle wood <eos> blind woolen cat bad bat breath beside me <eos> fuzzy face of pear tree <eos> ghoulish and cartoony <eos> surprise me like a monster <eos> my brother liked to scare me <eos> a rape in the meadow <eos> a fornicating fellow <eos> a flea on the fur of a shaggy old sheep <eos> all tangled up like winter <eos> bramble branch of brown tree <eos> cut the very life of <eos> her blood bank that billows <eos> up from below her <eos> skirt and sunlit blouses <eos> kangaroo mommy <eos> rapunzel and a tomboy <eos> fatherless a heart broke <eos> a hankering a steak knife <eos> a wallowing a child <eos> a banquet a hollycaust <eos> a pussy wussy willow <eos> marshmallow a mantra <eos> a temper tantric tantrum <eos> a full steam ahead and <eos> watch out here i come deep inside my heart and its splintered at its core <eos> molden curdle of milken puddle <eos> dreams of warm breasts settling in my mouth <eos> to be my spouse make a babe and a house <eos> apple tree drunken brawl domestically <eos> a dirty dog a dusty pawed bloody nose rose embroidered sheets <eos> dangle like women in the breeze on a line above the yard <eos> in my heart a flower dies slow like a campfire covered <eos> in piss mellows like snow fall <eos> mellows like snow fall <eos> raphael you know just how <eos> to take me in the swimming pool <eos> like a child being baptized <eos> beneath the starry sky we lie <eos> drowning in your watery thighs <eos> luscious eyes <eos> you a teenage player <eos> in my heart an island sinks slow <eos> tears fall in the kitchen sink o <eos> dont speak i can hear you <eos> dont speak i can hear you i caught a glimpse out the window <eos> a polish graveyard filled with widows <eos> i coddle a bottle of warm beer <eos> i see a pool of liquid tears <eos> glimmering so sweet and mellow <eos> a sea of lilting wilting willow <eos> a secret book of forgotten wishes <eos> drown in ponds with broken dishes <eos> the

baby dinosaurs <eos> maybe could live through it or indians and butterflies <eos> whats crushed is my spirit oh i fear it is too fragile <eos> like fall leaves burn like paper <eos> i always knew i would spend a lot of time alone <eos> no one would understand me <eos> maybe i should go and live amongst the animals <eos> spend all my time amongst the animals <eos> and on the tracks i would go they lead to the sea <eos> to be amongst the animals <eos> oh im just a fall leaf something simple and shy lie that <eos> thats how my heart lies down beside the sidewalk <eos> like an empty restaurant filled with perfume and balloons <eos> i sit and entertain the bizarre ghosts of my soul <eos> his name still lingers maybe lactates on my tongue <eos> perhaps im just teething for a foreign fallen destiny <eos> miserable but mine i look like his mother <eos> or sophia loren in an old fashioned movie <eos> slow motion i cling to my child desperate for love <eos> one day soon my brother died made me remember all the <eos> subordinate feelings i cast aside <eos> and maybe i had lied when i said i was ok <eos> just getting along like a little song that stops to sing and say <eos> "wild willow windy winter wont you blow through me <eos> my whole eternity" <eos> now i always knew that i would spend alot of time alone <eos> nooone would understand me maybe i should go and live amongst the animals <eos> spend all my time amongst the animals <eos> and on the tracks i would go they lead to the sea <eos> to be amongst the animals just give me information <eos> give me information tell me everything <eos> come see me on the phone ring <eos> just give me the headphones turn up everything <eos> oh yeah <eos> if you see her out there <eos> climbing a wall <eos> trying

who faded long ago had once been good to you <eos> the same old cars were riding in the drive <eos> you looked down at your hands and saw the lines <eos> were gone <eos> i can make you stay if you wanna be alone <eos> now theres nothing left to do but watch you go <eos> dont look back now dont come around <eos> i wish you well and i wish you away <eos> our neighbors send their kids off to the void <eos> our bedrooms lit our heroes on the wall <eos> could anything ever be this good again <eos> would you go back and change it if you could <eos> its coming up through the dark ive seen it <eos> grow from the spark to phoenix <eos> and if you go then you cant come home <eos> and if you go then you cant come home <eos> and if you go if you go saturday night never gets better <eos> im home alone missing out on you <eos> hurts like moonlight chasing me away <eos> dancing outside nobodys missing <eos> these nights dont feel like theyre ever gonna end <eos> someone come <eos> dont go

your mouth <eos> when i hold my breath <eos> when i break your stare <eos> when im caving in <eos> i speak to you while youre sleeping <eos> a sad code that goes i cant breathe anymore <eos> and ive got your back <eos> but youre changing right in front of my eyes <eos> ill keep you here for now <eos> and i wont let up <eos> ive got plenty to hide <eos> its a death <eos> you wont say my name <eos> you wont watch me sleep <eos> you wont turn my eyes <eos> you wont shut your mouth <eos> when i hold my breath <eos> when i break your stare <eos> when im caving in <eos> i want to keep you inside <eos> say our prayers <eos> and live in a lie <eos> pull the stars that hang in the sky <eos> and sleep with our bodies frozen in time <eos> ill keep you here for now <eos> and i wont let up <eos> ive got plenty to hide <eos> its a death <eos> you wont say my name <eos> you wont watch me sleep <eos> you wont turn my eyes <eos> you wont shut your mouth <eos> when i hold my breath <eos> when i break

it felt like losin a friend <eos> and well i dont want you anymore <eos> so take the money and run to your man i quit givin a fuck <eos> and well i dont trust you anymore <eos> so take the last train home in the dark and quit breakin my heart go on and tell them all your lies <eos> i saw you touch her in her sleep <eos> and it was no surprise <eos> youre burning papers in the field <eos> im downtown trying to push myself to steal <eos> but thats the way it goes <eos> you came and met me in the street <eos> we stole a car <eos> got high and went to sleep <eos> and dreamt we were the people that we want to be <eos> and when i met you you were sweet <eos> but now youre out sucking dick <eos> havent slept in a week <eos> but dont come crying to me took my hand and brought me down in the morning <eos> and i was sitting waiting for the telephone to swallow me whole <eos> i saw your face reflected on the resonant screen <eos> and i watched your mouth moving like a tired machine <eos> trying to plead with me <eos> trying to swallow me whole <eos> its been a while <eos> since ive been gone and away <eos> and i watched your eyes reflect me in a terrible way <eos> as you cast your gaze to the flickering hall <eos> and you knelt beside me and <eos> you started to pray <eos> and the whites of your eyes blackened <eos> with a hardened decay <eos> and you talked to me in a broken voice <eos> "in your open mouth <eos> silence me in your coursing <eos> blood in my eyes <eos> dress me in your clothes <eos> swallow me whole swallow me whole" <eos> your open mouth <eos> silence me in your coursing <eos> blood in my eyes <eos> dress me in your clothes <eos> swallow me whole swallow me whole <eos> your open mouth <eos> silence me in your coursing <eos> blood in my eyes <eos> dress me in your clothes <eos> swallow me whole swallow me whole <eos> your open mouth <eos> silence me in your coursing <eos> blood in my eyes <eos> dress me in your clothes <eos> swallow me whole swallow me whole your eyes they did flutter again <eos> and my mouth it did hang wide <eos> when you told me every little thing is going to be alright <eos> but we were younger then <eos> and now were not <eos> and if there was a plan made <eos> then we forgot about it <eos> and if there was time <eos> i could figure it out now <eos> but life is short and i dont care for most of it <eos> because youre all that i want <eos> well i know im hard to take <eos> and my bones are calling out your name <eos> while i beat your cold windows <eos> break the locks on the gate <eos> while i try to forget i used to be something great <eos> because youre all that i want i woke up today with a darkness keeping me cold <eos> wild bird flocks guarding my home <eos> i dont know what to do <eos> my eyes gone black from the stolen heart that i gave to <eos> you <eos> darkness keeps me all alone <eos> darkness eats away at the place that were calling <eos> our home <eos> i went to bed on a starless night <eos> i took the bus downtown in the morning light <eos> and hung your ghost from the power lines <eos> your crooked mouth trying hard not to say goodbye <eos> saying i wont ask you <eos> darkness keeps me all alone <eos> darkness eats away at the place that were calling <eos> our home <eos> while youre dreaming i can barley breathe <eos> i tell you that i love you but you dont mean shit to me <eos> its like were living in a fantasy <eos> and im watching you try to pretend that youre asleep <eos> but i wont wake you <eos> i know a place where we can go tonight <eos> where we can trade all of our money for a homesick fade <eos> to white <eos> you tell me that you never want to leave <eos> and you hang your body form the balcony and swing <eos> saying please just let me let go <eos> darkness keeps me all alone <eos> darkness eats away at the place that were calling <eos> our home theres some stars in my eyes <eos> your sisters high peaking on pills in the alleyway <eos> theres a mad death in your eyes <eos> warm light shudders in the glow of my heart <eos> and the kids with black eyes shine bright in the morning light <eos> warm day in the sun <eos> it keeps me balling up my fists for someone <eos> why do you always plead <eos> keep me on my knees <eos> keep running for the train <eos> but i guess i always worked better alone <eos> with my black eyes shining in the sunset <eos> never give up <eos> theres some stars in your eyes <eos> the kids who shot mikey are down low and telling their lies <eos> well he died here with me <eos> but were digging through his pockets <eos> singing no ones ever going to be free <eos> were singing hallelujah <eos> im sorry <eos> are there stars <eos> that the gods dont know about <eos> if there are <eos> well be digging through their pockets til dawn <eos> are there lights <eos> lights that shine for pretty fools like you and me <eos> were singing hallelujah i broke in <eos> to your house again today <eos> and i laid in your room <eos> and it was pretty but its sad <eos> cause it was all inside my head <eos> i dont know whats real or dreaming anymore <eos> its harder than it looks sometimes <eos> to stand up straight and look you in the eyes <eos> and believe in all your fucked up lies <eos> cause its your world i live inside <eos> its your world i live inside <eos> bury me <eos> inside the doll house in your bedroom <eos> and carve your name into my arm <eos> and quietly <eos> youll fall asleep <eos> and abandon me <eos> but i take it im ready <eos> its harder than it looks sometimes <eos> to stand up straight and look you in the eyes <eos> and believe in all your fucked up lies <eos> cause its your world i live inside <eos> its your world i live inside i held you in my arms just yesterday <eos> when you lie you always touch your hair <eos> when you tell me that he wasnt there <eos> you called me when you woke up <eos> and you stayed calm cause i choked up <eos> and maybe were both fcked <eos> or maybe im just bad luck <eos> so ill make up my bed <eos> try to get high <eos> try to forget what you said <eos> then i call you again <eos> cause i cant sleep <eos> i dont feel like i used to <eos> and you dont look like you want to <eos> and your skin crawls and my jaw clicks <eos> its not bad if youre used to it <eos> not broke if it cant be fixed <eos> not real if you question it <eos> not clean if were still a mess <eos> and were still a mess <eos> you got sick so you quit school <eos> and were dead broke but it fits you <eos> and its not like it wont get you too <eos> i was just like you <eos> so i make up my bed <eos> try to get clean <eos> try to forget you instead <eos> then i call you again <eos> cause i cant sleep on a parfois le cåur soulevã© par la sauvagerie du monde <eos> on est ã©cåurã© par lannonce dune nouvelle tyrannie <eos> le raffinement des anciennes par les mensonges <eos> lodeur du fumier dans les villes <eos> lhorreur qui pã¨se sur tous nos lendemain <eos> on sengloutit alors dans un sombre dã©sespoir <eos> on a peur on a honte puis on est triste dãªtre humain <eos> on rã©clame en pleurant une naissance nouvelle <eos> ou du moins ladmission par baptãªme dans une nouvelle confrã©rie <eos> et on redoute de npas pouvoir obtenir ni lune ni lautre <eos> que le monde refuse de sarrãªter pour nous et quon ne peut que le quitter <eos> plonger dans une douteuse ã©ternitã© <eos> notre foyer lui mãªme nous semble hostile <eos> comme si tous les talismans qui dã©finissaient notre identitã© <eos> sã©taient retournã©s contre nous <eos> on se sent dã©chirã© et en piã¨ce et en morceaux <eos> on prend alors avec terreur que si on npeut pas sasseoir pour rã©unir ces morceaux <eos> et les assembler ã  nouveau on va devenir fou <eos> mais parfois se produit pourtant une maniã¨re dã©vã©nements mystã©rieux et ã©blouissants <eos> quon contemple encore longtemps aprã¨s <eos> et avec un ã©merveillement mãªlã© du respect quimpose le sacrã© de ma fenãªtre je vois les ã©lã¨ves du lycã©e rodin <eos> qui sortent de cours en poussant des cris de joie <eos> les garã§ons paradent ils ont lair plein de sã¨ve <eos> et les leggings des filles

limpression de perdre le contrã´le <eos> de perdre le contrã´le sur toutes les choses <eos> dans lesquelles jã©tais impliquã© <eos> sur tous les ã©lã©ments de ma vie <eos> ãa ma plongã© dans un ã©tat de colã¨re <eos> absolument indescriptible <eos> cã©tait insoutenable <eos> cest comme ãªtre enfermã© dans une boite sans lumiã¨re <eos> dans laquelle le temps sarrãªte <eos> cest comme ãªtre dans les limbes en fait <eos> tu peux plus aller en avant plus aller en arriã¨re <eos> tu peux plus aller dans aucune direction <eos> tes complã¨tement bloquã© <eos> ã larrãªt en panne <eos> tas les pieds dans le ciment <eos> je me suis senti comme un requin tigre <eos> vous savez que les requins quand ils avancent plus <eos> ils crã¨vent <eos> et le requin tigre cest le plus agressif <eos> quand il est immobilisã© il dã©fonce tout ce qui passe <eos> et cest la mãªme chose avec les loups quand tu les coinces <eos> moi je me servais de la musique et des mots et de lã©criture pour avancer <eos> pour progresser ã  travers lexistence <eos> alors quand jai perdu ã§a ben <eos> ben jai perdu ma capacitã© ã  progresser <eos> cest comme ã§a que je me suis mis ã  gueuler <eos> tu peux plus interagir avec le monde <eos> tu te renfermes petit ã  petit <eos> tu deviens totalement hermã©tique aux autres et au quotidien <eos> parce que le matin quand tu te rã©veilles <eos> et le soir quand tu te couches <eos> quand tu marches quand tu bosses <eos> quand tu parles quand tu conduis <eos> tu te rã©pã¨tes en permanence <eos> en permanence <eos> je suis nulle part <eos> je vais nulle part <eos> je suis pã©trifiã© <eos> et je serai jamais rien dautre que ã§a <eos> il faut choisir de de pas y penser <eos> choisir que ã§a existe pas <eos> choisir de pas avoir de problã¨me avec ã§a <eos> il faut sortir <eos> faut voir ses amis <eos> et attendre que ã§a revienne vieux frã¨re <eos> tu dois encore ãªtre en cage ã  cette heure ci <eos> moi jai pas fait grand chose depuis ce matin jai ã©cris un peu <eos> je me suis touchã© un peu aussi <eos> ce midi jai vu les autres vieux frã¨re elle est belle <eos> cã©tait ã©clairant comme ã  chaque fois <eos> et puis cette aprã¨m je suis allã© rã©cupã©rer mes affaires <eos> cã©tait tellement ã©trange <eos> jai dis au revoir ã  la photocopieuse <eos> puis ã  ceux et celles qui restent ã  bord <eos> ils mont souhaitã©s bonne chance <eos> jai hã¢te quon se rejoigne tous dehors demain <eos> au premiã¨res heures du jour et quon sen aille enfin <eos> tu te souviens quand on parlait de changer de vie <eos> si on avait su que ã§a arriverait <eos> moi aussi je suis inquiet forcement <eos> on a pas ã©tã© habituã© ã  tous ã§a cest vrai <eos> mais je sais aussi quon sera pas seul quon sera avec tout les autres vieux frã¨res <eos> et quensemble on a de quoi faire <eos> et puis les signaux sont lã  tu les entends et tu les vois comme moi <eos> alors finalement mãªme si on sait pas oã¹ tout ã§a nous emmã¨nera il faut quon ose <eos> quon fasse le geste <eos> il faut quon se lance vieux frã¨re <eos> je crois quy a rien de plus fort <eos> je sais pas comment expliquer ã§a cest que ã§a se voit dans les yeux <eos> tu te dis merde jai limpression de

un blizzard <eos> comme les mystiques losers au grand cåur <eos> il faut quon sonne lalarme quon se retrouve quon se rejoigne <eos> quon sembrasse quon soit des milliards de mains sur des milliards dã©paules <eos> quon se rã©pã¨te encore une fois que lennui est un crime <eos> que la vie est un casse du siã¨cle un putain de piment rouge <eos> nique sa mã¨re le blizzard <eos> nique sa mã¨re le blizzard <eos> tout ã§a cest fini regardes pas les affiches <eos> fais pas gaffe aux signaux <eos> mets bien tes mains sur tes oreilles <eos> quand tentends rire les narvalos sauvagement <eos> ceux qui portent leur membre ã  bout de bras <eos> qui te disent quun cul ã§a sattrape ou ã§a nest pas <eos> de quoi tas peur <eos> alors dis leur que ton machin est contrariã© <eos> que parfois quand une fille te parle <eos> tu sens tes billes se rã©tracter <eos> depuis que cartonne au boxoffice <eos> la grande idã©e selon laquelle la compassion cest dã©passã© <eos> disleur que tu te sens seul <eos> et que tu sais plus quoi faire pour trouver un peu de chaleur humaine <eos> aller au bois pour que quelquun accepte enfin <eos> de toucher ton zob <eos> tripoter de la lycã©enne <eos> porter des robes <eos> te trã©mousser en talons hauts comme un gogo <eos> puis arpenter les ruelles sombres en secouant ta clochette <eos> cest un peu ã  cause de tout ã§a si tous les soirs cest la mãªme histoire <eos> mã©tro apã©ro lexo clopes et pornos ã  lancienne <eos> sur lesquels tu tentraã®nes rageusement <eos> mãªme si ã§a fait longtemps que ã§a tamuse plus vraiment <eos> mais il faut pas que tu dã©sespã¨res <eos> perds pas espoir <eos> promis jurã© quon la vivra notre putain de belle histoire <eos> ce sera plus des mensonges <eos> quelque chose de grand <eos> qui sauve la vie qui trompe la mort qui dã©glingue enfin le blizzard <eos> imaginetoi tes lã  en train de te reprendre un verre au bar <eos> quand tout ã  coup tu croises un regard qui te perfore de part en part <eos> imaginetoi tes lã  ã§a te tombe dessus sans crier gare <eos> un truc bandant un truc dã©ment qui redonne la foi <eos> un truc comme ã§a <eos> â«bonsoir quelle chance de se croiser ici <eos> bonsoir bonsoir je voudrais partager tes nuitsâ» <eos> tu connaã®tras les nuits fauves je te le promets <eos> elle sera tigre en embuscade quand tu viens te glisser sous ses draps <eos> tandis que toi tu feras scintiller tes canines lorsquelle enlã¨ve le bas <eos> elle toffrira des feulements dans sa voix lorsquelle reprend son souffle <eos> qui sã©chappent dans la cour pour aller faire gauler la lune <eos> des coups de bã©lier invoquã©s comme un miracle <eos> et qui veulent dire â«si tu tarrãªtes je meursâ» <eos> toutes ces choses qui te la feront raidir rien quã  te souvenir <eos> pour le million dannã©es ã  venir <eos> malheureusement tout ce quon toffre pour linstant <eos> cest des chattes ã©pilã©es et des seins en plastique en vidã©o <eos> cest terrifiant <eos> tout le monde veut la mãªme chose <eos> mãªme les travelos rãªvent du prince charmant <eos> et pourtant on passe notre temps <eos> a se mettre des coups de cutter dans les paumes <eos> a trop mentir ã  force de dire <eos> je ten supplie me parle pas range la guimauve ã©carte les cuisses <eos> ferme ta gueule laissemoi juste kiffer mon vaetvient de taulard <eos> et mendormir direct moins de trois minutes plus tardâ» <eos> a force de faire tout ã§a on croyait quoi <eos> on se meurtrit on fait lamour comme on sessuie <eos> quel putain dgaspillage <eos> mais il faut pas que tu dã©sespã¨res perds pas lespoir <eos> promis

les nuits fauves <eos> en ã©change de tout ã§a <eos> je toffre ce dont je dispose <eos> mon corps mon ã¢me prends tout tout de suite <eos> et quon se noie dans les nuits fauves <eos> et tant pis si on nous prend pour des demeurã©s <eos> bien sã»r quon sait quici cest pas hollywood <eos> sauf quaux derniã¨res nouvelles <eos> le fantasme cest encore gratuit <eos> cest pour ã§a quon se rã©fugie dans nos pensã©es <eos> quon ferme les yeux trã¨s fort jusquã  voir des couleurs <eos> en attendant que ã§a passe <eos> y a que comme ã§a quon peut rãªver de caresses au rã©veil <eos> et de regards qui veulent dire â«tinquiã¨tes plus tinquiã¨tes plusâ» <eos> de coups de poings dans le cåur <eos> de e qui rugissent dans nos poumons ã  faire sauter les cã´tes <eos> de torrents dans nos veines <eos> dune ã©paule pour pleurer sans honte <eos> et dune oreille pour tout dire <eos> tout dire toujours quoiquil arrive <eos> de serments argentã©s prononcã©s face au rayon vert <eos> â«estce que tu veux

dã©sespã©rã©ment celui ou celle <eos> qui apaisera dun doigt nos muscles nouã©s <eos> et nos encã©phales en sousrã©gime <eos> on attend dã©sespã©rã©ment celui ou celle <eos> qui fera battre notre

encore dan mexpliquer sa thã©orie <eos> en sagrippant fermement lentrejambe <eos> il me disait comme ã§a avec cet accent que je tã©pargne <eos> "il faut distinguer le cock music et le smart music tu vois <eos> rolling stones pixies acdc gunsnroses et cetera et cetera <eos> cest une question de gã©nã©ration mon petit gars" <eos> ok il a peutãªtre raison je sais pas <eos> ya quelque chose dironique dans tout ã§a <eos> comme si une fois le big magnet sã©tait dis <eos> "tiens pierrot amã¨nestoi amã¨nestoi quon rigole <eos> tiens tu le vois lautre tarã© en bas <eos> et ben moi jai dã©cidã© que pour les prochaines annã©es <eos> il avancera les yeux bandã©s" <eos> et pierre de rã©pliquer <eos> "seigneur soyez pas pute <eos> laissez lui au moins des indices parci parlã  jen sais rien" <eos> et il en fã»t ainsi <eos> depuis depuis <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun dã©ment dun amant quon plaque <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun amant quon plaque <eos> dun dã©ment quon claque <eos> je revois encore matthieu <eos> et les ã©toiles dans ses yeux <eos> entre deux cigarettes <eos> fumã©es ã  la fenãªtre de ma chambre <eos> il me disait comme ã§a <eos> "mon vieux tu savais que le verbe cristallisait la pensã©e <eos> je te jure un mot sã»r une idã©e foireuse <eos> cest exactement comme un baiser <eos> tas pas remarquã©" <eos> cest une question de perception <eos> et au fond je sais quil a raison <eos> y a quelque chose de mystique dans son affaire <eos> pouvoir ramasser les mots par terre <eos> et les jeter comme des pierres <eos> contre les parois plongã©es dans le noir <eos> pour en faire sortir les choses qui blessent <eos> grã¢ce ã  la parole rã©ussir ã  sarmer <eos> contre les sales pensã©es et faire des plans <eos> serrer les poings serrer les dents <eos> les cogner leur rentrer dedans <eos> essayer dattraper les syllabes ã  la volã©e <eos> pour en faire des bougies qui ã©clairent <eos> et quon placera sous les paupiã¨res <eos> ou des jolies bouquets <eos> pour une fille qui nous plaã®t <eos> finalement cest pour ã§a que jã©cris <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun dã©ment dun amant quon plaque <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun amant quon plaque <eos> dun dã©ment quon claque <eos> je revois encore thibault ã©clairã© par le halo <eos> de la lampe ã  pã©trole <eos> il me disait comme ã§a <eos> entre les vapeurs dalcool <eos> â«tu sais quon peut flotter audessus du sol <eos> rien quavec la parole <eos> je te jure on faisait ã§a quand jã©tais enfant <eos> sur le terrain vague derriã¨re chez mes parentsâ» <eos> cest juste une question de conviction <eos> et je prie pour quil aie raison <eos> y a quelque chose de magnifique dans son histoire <eos> de savoir que si tout foire <eos> il nous en reste dans les tiroirs <eos> grã¢ce ã  eux eux qui ont reã§u le feu sacrã© <eos> qui permet de tout voir <eos> eux les machine ã  observer <eos> les machines ã  mettre des mots sur tout <eos> eux qui ã©crivent plus vite que la pensã©e <eos> et avec ã§a ils agrandissent la vie <eos> ils font apparaã®tre les fils <eos> qui relient toutes les choses entre elles <eos> et ã§a leur donne le courage de tout affronter <eos> mãªme la kolyma <eos> en attendant moi <eos> en attendant moi quoi <eos> moi jai rien vu rien lu <eos> rien entendu et surtout rien compris <eos> mais cest pas grave je tattend tant pis <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun dã©ment dun amant quon plaque <eos> jour et nuit je traque les ã©piphanies <eos> avec la rage dun mercenaire sous crack <eos> dun alcoolique en manque de jack <eos> dun amant quon plaque <eos> dun dã©ment quon claque quon claque <eos> la parole comme vaccin contre la mort <eos> la parole comme rempart contre lennui <eos> parlez parlez parlez encore <eos> parlez pour affronter la nuit <eos> la parole comme vaccin contre la mort <eos> la parole comme rempart contre lennui <eos> parlez

du wagon <eos> elles dansent par dessus le monde matã©riel <eos> jte revois sur lherbe au bord du fleuve <eos> jrevois la forme des nuages les pã©ages les routes les villages <eos> et jnous revois dans le nuit chaude tout ã  lheure <eos> le vent dans tes cheveux les lampadaires qui dã©filent en orange <eos> et toi qui texcuse en pleine rue <eos> et puis tes larmes et puis tes bras <eos> et moi

dentendre les sirã¨nes <eos> mãªme ã  travers le double vitrage <eos> on prend les mãªmes et on recommence <eos> je mã©tais dã©cidã© ã  sortir parce que <eos> je supportais plus dãªtre chez moi <eos> je suis allã© rejoindre des gens <eos> dans un de ces pubs irlandais merdiques <eos> quon trouve sur les grands boulevards <eos> ã une table sur ma gauche y avait un groupe de filles <eos> dont une qui ma tout de suite plu <eos> elle ã©tait un peu mate de peau <eos> mais avec des cheveux chã¢tains clairs <eos> ou blonds foncã©s je sais jamais <eos> mais surtout elle avait lair douce <eos> bienveillante et sereine <eos> comme si elle avait pas renoncã© <eos> ã rien comme si elle avait jamais doutã© de la beautã© du monde <eos> ni de celles des hommes <eos> je me suis fait quelques films <eos> osã©s mais jolis <eos> restait tout de mãªme ã  ã©tablir le contact <eos> ce qui est impossible ã  faire en rã©alitã© <eos> on nous le fait croire dans les films <eos> mais cest une vaste

envoyã©e par un genre de rugbyman pas trã¨s discret <eos> un gars que je connaissais un peu <eos> alors ã§a va lartiste <eos> il me dit <eos> les amours tout ã§a <eos> dailleurs aux concerts tu dois bien te faire plaisir mon salaud <eos> le genre de choses qui met tout de suite super ã  laise <eos> qui te rapproche encore un peu plus de leunuque dans son harem <eos> je lui rã©ponds que ã§a <eos> cest soit un mythe complet <eos> soit cest moi et mes petits camarades qui sommes des manches <eos> ãvidemment il se met ã  me charrier <eos> me dit que cest pas possible <eos> que jai un problã¨me

babe youve got a lot of love <eos> coming my name is mary magdalen <eos> i come from palestine <eos> please excuse these rags im in <eos> but ive fallen on hard times <eos> but long ago i had my work <eos> when i was in my prime <eos> but i gave it up and all for love <eos> it was his career or mine <eos> jesus loved me <eos> this i know <eos> but why on earth <eos> did i ever let him go <eos> he was always faithful <eos> he was always kind <eos> but he walked off <eos> with this heart of mine <eos> a love like this will come but once <eos> this i do believe <eos> and ill not see his like again <eos> as i live and breath <eos> and im sorry if i might offend <eos> but i will never see <eos> how the tenderness i shared with him <eos> became a heresy <eos> jesus loved me <eos> this i know <eos> but why on earth <eos> did i ever let him go <eos> he was always faithful <eos> he was always kind <eos> but he walked off <eos> with this heart of mine <eos> but i remember nights we spent <eos> whispering our creed <eos> our rituals our sacraments <eos> the stars our canopy <eos> there beneath an olive tree <eos> wed offer up our plea <eos> gods creation innocent <eos> his arms surrounding me <eos> jesus loves me <eos> this i know <eos> but why on earth <eos> did he ever have to go <eos> he was always faithful <eos> he was always kind <eos> but he walked off <eos> with this heart of mine button up that shirt youre supposed to wear <eos> dont forget your airline ticket or to brush your hair <eos> show that family that you care <eos> but could you wear something that celebrates <eos> everything you love and maybe what your family hates <eos> cause that might be what it takes <eos> its your fire its your soul you shouldnt have to go <eos> its your fire its your soul you shouldnt have to go <eos> first thing theyll says take off your shoes <eos> and theyll say they want your story but they get confused <eos> by all those words you use <eos> a year ago your car went off a cliff <eos> and you saw an angel in midair who said youd live <eos> well thats a story you can give <eos> its your fire its your soul you shouldnt have to go <eos> your fire your soul you shouldnt have to go <eos> and theyll say "youre family you belong to us <eos> you can stay at home and have our love and trust <eos> but any day now one of us could die <eos> and if we make you suffer dont you want to find out why <eos> cause we love to watch you try <eos> with your fire your soul your soul <eos> its your fire its your fire its your fire <eos> then youll fly home and get the flu <eos> and youll keep staring at the ground you always do <eos> when they get their time with you <eos> you are not a punching bag my dear <eos> i think your darkest day should have some light this year <eos> i think you should stay right here <eos> its your fire its your soul you shouldnt have to go <eos> its your fire its your soul you shouldnt have to go two sides of a river <eos> the river rushes through <eos> two sides of a river <eos> one for me and one for you <eos> we can build a bridge or baby <eos> we can jump in <eos> see what the river do <eos> its two sides of a river <eos> great big river rushin through <eos> i know the tides of the river <eos> know how fast and how deep <eos> i know the tides of a river <eos> hope and pray they dont shift in your sleep <eos> cause the river bides its lonely loss <eos> it has no vows to keep <eos> i know the tides of a river <eos> pray pray they dont shift in your sleep <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> before i ever met you <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> where it took me was all that i knew <eos> now i finally found a love to share my secrets with <eos> lots of things we can do <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> thats where i learned to rock you <eos> now i finally found a love to share my secrets with <eos> lots of things we can do <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> thats where i learned to rock you why is it that as we grow older and stronger <eos> the road signs point us adrift and make us afraid <eos> saying "you never can win" "watch your back" "wheres your husband" <eos> oh i dont like the signs that the sign makers made <eos> so im going to steal out with my paint and brushes <eos> ill change the directions ill hit every street <eos> its the tinseltown scandal the robin hood vandal <eos> she goes out and steals the kings english <eos> and in the morning you wake up and the signs point to you <eos> they say <eos> "im so glad that you finally made it here" <eos> "you thought nobody cared but i did i could tell" <eos> and "this is your year" and "it always starts here" <eos> and oh "youre aging well" <eos> well i know a woman with a collection of sticks <eos> she could fight back the hundreds of voices she heard <eos> and she could poke at the greed she could fend off her need <eos> and with anger she found she could pound every word <eos> but one voice got through caught her up by surprise <eos> it said "dont hold us back were the story you tell" <eos> and no sooner than spoken a spell had been broken <eos> and the voices before her were trumpets and tympani <eos> violins basses and woodwinds and cellos singing <eos> "were so glad that you finally made it here <eos> you thought nobody cared but we did we could tell <eos> and now youll dance through the days while the orchestra plays <eos> and oh youre aging well" <eos> now when i was fifteen oh i knew it was over <eos> the road to enchantment was not mine to take <eos> cause lower calf upper arm should be half what they are <eos> i was breaking the laws that the sign makers made <eos> and all i could eat was the poisonous apple <eos> and thats not a story i was meant to survive <eos> i was all out of choices but the woman of voices <eos> she turned round the corner with music around her <eos> she gave me the language that keeps me alive she said <eos> "im so glad that you finally made it here <eos> with the things you know now that only time could tell <eos> looking back seeing far landing right where we are <eos> and oh youre aging oh and i am aging <eos> oh arent we aging well" welcome to the golden age of speed with grace waiting for the angry gods to smite our race <eos> i logged on to africa for just one day i opened a door and thats ok <eos> its not an end its just a start not an end its just a start <eos> the worlds not falling apart the worlds not falling apart because of me <eos> i have watched the kids who make their scenes i have met the riot grrls who print their zines <eos> they write the word they raise a thought they say who they are they try what theyre not <eos> because life is such a changing art life is such a changing art <eos> the worlds not falling apart the worlds not falling apart because of me <eos> the closest thing to god that i have heard is when i knew i did not have the final word <eos> you say the world has lost its love i say embrace what its made of <eos> ill snake a camera to your heart snake a camera to your heart <eos> the worlds not falling apart the worlds not falling apart because of me when i want to go somewhere i dont ask forgiveness <eos> i just go where i like and he knows that <eos> i walk alone into any party im alone tonight <eos> in that highheeled ego old hat <eos> oh blue night laughter at the bell toll <eos> people move like streaks of charcoal <eos> someone found a prince in the punchbowl <eos> but high times fizzle out in a change of heart <eos> and we know things fall apart <eos> the mornings off to a bad start <eos> its raining have you had nights like this <eos> i run miles to his place wake him up to look at his face <eos> i feel astray and i love it when it gets that way <eos> the child is so young they say that child is truly free <eos> and with a mind of perpetual invention <eos> so why is it now im a grownup all grown up <eos> and yet now i fly through the ceilings of convention <eos> oh new friend borne out of a mindcloud <eos> make believe and yet i laugh aloud <eos> ive cried when you have stood ground <eos> but sometimes playtimes are a ghost ive faced <eos> in that room that ive erased <eos> the air is empty and druglaced <eos> i am completely gone are you still with me then <eos> with my head so big and awfully <eos> take my hand and lead me softly <eos> and then you stay and i love it when it gets that way <eos> and when i was crazy maybe i wanted i wanted i wanted to be steady as an iceberg <eos> and with nowhere fast agoing <eos> now now i can handle the danger zone with hailstones all aflying <eos> and the crazy winds ablowing <eos> these days i havent been smoking my lungs brown <eos> have that itch to turn my life around <eos> maybe move on to a new town <eos> cause good friends lifted me out of an early tomb <eos> pulled my life out from its doom <eos> like sun into a big room <eos> and where my roots have grown <eos> i really cant let go <eos> through the woods and through the fields climb <eos> up the mountain into nighttime <eos> into the day and i love it when it gets that way i tried again i went last night <eos> another date was just not right <eos> and as i drove myself back home <eos> a little voice said "just be alone" <eos> but sometimes i think <eos> i see you in a crowd <eos> its not picture perfect youre just meant for me somehow <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you <eos> oh ill miss you till i meet you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> i love the world just as it is <eos> and i wont lose my faith in it <eos> but there are days i think of you <eos> saying "hey thats beautiful yeah i see it too" <eos> it all goes by so fast like waving hands <eos> wanna capture things <eos> find someone who understands <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you <eos> oh ill miss you till i meet you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> can you keep me awake <eos> i thought you could help <eos> just to feel my way <eos> find my better self <eos> oh ill miss you <eos> oh ill miss you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> the mornings gone <eos> all dreamed away <eos> but thats all right <eos> its saturday <eos> when people think <eos> that they might see <eos> the next chapter of their destiny <eos> and on monday morning comes around <eos> get the work done but i listen for the sound <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you well were heading for a past that you leave not defend <eos> where the downtowns hold the sadness of you cant go back again <eos> its there youll find the rust and debtors <eos> motel signs with missing letters <eos> cause theres a monster on the outskirts <eos> says it knows what your town needs <eos> then it eats it up like nothing and it wont spit out the seeds <eos> and we can be the super shoppers <eos> we can say were really smart <eos> we can say our town is doing fine without a beating heart <eos> we can even say the money saved is all our own <eos> its bought and sold its bought and sold <eos> and were heading for a nasty business keeps our country growing <eos> where the weapons that were selling are the only seeds were sowing <eos> you get to blow the fruits of all your labors <eos> sell fs to all the neighbors <eos> and we know that its for money <eos> and thats how the west gets bargained <eos> you the know the last time this happened <eos> even vietnam got jargoned <eos> and you can say theyre out to hunt you <eos> you can say theyre out to fish you <eos> you can join a gang of restless boys <eos> or start your own militia <eos> you can even say your violence is all your own <eos> its bought and sold its bought and sold <eos> well i look up to the people who are less bought than i <eos> you can show them what youre selling <eos> and theyll only ask you why <eos> and their paychecks dont have lots of zeros <eos> theyre my friends and theyre my heroes <eos> and the tv sets are angry cause they just cant make em pay <eos> but i like the way these people read the signs and walk away <eos> and we can call ourselves the makers <eos> and the keepers of the times <eos> we can spend our sand dollars <eos> and sand nickels and sand dimes <eos> we can even say prosperity is all our own <eos> its bought and sold its bought and sold <eos> we can even say our loneliness is all our own <eos> its bought and sold its bought and sold <eos> its bought and sold its bought and sold im not a leader <eos> im not a leftwingrehtoric <eos> mobilizing force of one <eos> but but there was a time way back <eos> many years ago in college <eos> dont laugh <eos> but i thought i was a radical <eos> i ran a hemp liberation league with my boyfriend <eos> it was true love with a common cause <eos> and besides that he was a sagittarius <eos> we used to say that our love was like hemp rope <eos> three times as strong as the rope that you buy domesticly <eos> we would bond in the face of oppression from big business <eos> and the deans <eos> but i knew there was a problem <eos> every time the group would meet <eos> everyone would light up <eos> it made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights <eos> not to mention chemotherapy <eos> well sometimes life gives us lessons <eos> sent in ridiculous packaging <eos> so i found him in the arms of a "student <eos> against the treacherous use of fur" <eos> and he gave no apology <eos> he just turned to me stoned out to the edge of oblivion <eos> he didnt pull up the sheets and i think he even smiled <eos> as the said to me spoken <eos> well i guess our dreams went up in smokehuhuh <eos> and i said <eos> no our dreams went up in dreamsyou stupid pothead <eos> and another thing <eos> what kind of a name is "students <eos> against the treacherous use of fur" <eos> fur is already dead and besides <eos> a name like that doesnt make a good acronym <eos> i am older now <eos> i know the rise and gradual fall of a daily victory <eos> and i still write to my senators saying they should <eos> legalize cannabis and i should know <eos> cause i am a horticulturist <eos> i have a husband and two children out in lexington mass <eos> and my exboyfriend cant tell me ive sold out <eos> because hes in a cult <eos> and hes not allowed to talk to me lets go fishing in the morning just like weve always gone <eos> you can come inside and wake me up <eos> well pack and leave by dawn we will pack and leave by dawn <eos> and youll say ill hear something and ill say never you mind <eos> its just our two poles knocking in the back seat <eos> and your truck is doing fine today and everything is fine <eos> and your truck will climb up slowly and well see how far weve gone <eos> and the hills will stretch before us <eos> they are rolling on and on they are rolling on and on <eos> and the fish will look up at our boat with envy and with fear <eos> because we will live forever and our days are slow and dear <eos> and our days are slow and dear "hes a quiet man" thats all she said <eos> and hes a thoughtful man <eos> its just he likes to keep his thoughts up in his head <eos> and we finally meet and she tries to draw him out a bit <eos> she says "hes writing something <eos> hey now why dont you talk about it" <eos> and he doesnt make a sound <eos> hes just staring at his coffee <eos> and i know theres all this beauty <eos> and this greatness shell defend <eos> but i think its in my friend <eos> i have a friend in a bright and distant town <eos> shes found a common balance <eos> where you do your work and you do your love <eos> and they pay you and praise your many talents <eos> well im passing through and we know we wont sleep <eos> she laughs puts up the tea <eos> she says "you know i think you remember every part of me" <eos> and the water starts to boil <eos> and if i had a camera <eos> showing all the light we give <eos> and showing where the light extends <eos> id give it to my friends <eos> sometimes i see myself fine sometimes i need a witness <eos> and i like the whole truth <eos> but there are nights i only need forgiveness <eos> sometimes they say "i dont know who you are <eos> but let me walk with you some" <eos> and i say "i am alone thats all <eos> you cant save me from all the wrong ive done" love took a long time it followed me here <eos> and it landed on light feet and it whispered in my ear <eos> love spoke of my past as a valuable test <eos> and smiled and said she who loves last loves best <eos> cause you know life is hard but now you also know your mind <eos> so now youre going out to love but on your own side this time <eos> where you still think of famine and you still dig up train fare <eos> and you wont mind the wrinkles cause you know how they got there <eos> in love but not at peace in love but not at peace <eos> once for me love was the boat inside of a bottle it felt like a gondola ride <eos> when you float with the nicknacks and you dont hear a sound <eos> where the fish never lived and you dont miss the ground <eos> then the moon hangs above like a valium pill <eos> and i say ill be fine but i dont think that i will <eos> but today i got work and i like it that way <eos> its a case of a still life gone cine a verit <eos> in love but not at peace in love but not at peace <eos> and i still need the beauty of words sung and spoken <eos> and i live with the fear that my spirit will be broken <eos> and thats the way i thought it would be <eos> thats the way i always wanted it to be <eos> so ill keep you wondering what time im arriving <eos> you drive me crazy with your backseat driving <eos> and ill talk in my sleep and youll steal all the covers <eos> well argue it out and well call ourselves lovers <eos> and ill stay in my body and youll stay in your own <eos> cause we know that were born and were dying alone <eos> so turn out the light while the sirens are screaming <eos> and we kiss for the waking and then join the dreaming <eos> in love but not at peace in love but not at peace its a small town life and i like it <eos> cause the bad dont get in your way <eos> theres an angry god gonna strike it <eos> yeah thats what we pay him for thats why we pray <eos> well i guess the angry god he was afishing <eos> when molly called me up with the news <eos> within the space of a week <eos> yeah a pervert or a sex freak <eos> let the kids take a peek <eos> thats more than a little cheek <eos> no pun intended <eos> going east of mississippi got a flinty kind of woman <eos> and you dont act smart and you dont touch my children <eos> if the young man wants to see the sun go down <eos> well there was no time fooling with the trifles <eos> so there was no use in telling the men <eos> they would just go running for their rifles <eos> and then once you got him couldnt get him again <eos> so peg got a bolt of fishing tackle <eos> and marge got her gardening clips <eos> and sally labiche put her hound on a leash <eos> and the timer on the quiche shes kind of nouveau riche <eos> but we like her <eos> going east of mississippi got a flinty kind of woman <eos> and you dont act fresh and you dont touch my children <eos> if the young man wants to see the sun go down <eos> it was the kids who spotted him a running <eos> as we drove through the harbor fog <eos> and thats when we got our engines gunning <eos> cause we knew he was headed for the cranberry bog <eos> we got our hiphigh rubber boots strapped on <eos> and molly got the big flashlights out <eos> and by the "welcome to new england" sign <eos> got him with the fishing line <eos> in the dark smell of brine <eos> betty said "this one is mine" <eos> she is ruthless <eos> going east of mississippi got a flinty kind of woman <eos> and you just say no and you dont touch my children <eos> if the young man wants to see the sun go down <eos> well we didnt have to drag him and ajail him <eos> cause you dont have to take it so far <eos> when your roots go back to old salem <eos> and youve got a local chapter of the dar <eos> now i dont go tooting on my lobsters <eos> cause your pride doesnt go with your plaid <eos> but its a victory won and it couldnt be done <eos> by the hippydippy flakyshaky funinthesun <eos> bra less wonders <eos> going east of mississippi got a flinty kind of woman <eos> and you know your place and you dont touch my children <eos> if the young man wants to see the sun go down <eos> if the young man wants to see the sun go down well you have been kind and i know it seems hopeless <eos> you smooth the ground tear the knots all apart <eos> youre helping me move from the inside to the outside <eos> youre trying so hard and i cant even start <eos> its a war in there <eos> its a war in there <eos> and you peacemakers go to the same place as soldiers <eos> if you want to make peace well you gotta find the pain <eos> you bring your words but youre just like them youre unprepared <eos> cause you dont know the terrain <eos> its a war in there <eos> its a war in there <eos> and dont you know ill never give you a medal <eos> laid back on stateside in the central time zone <eos> the one that they pinned to the outside to the outside <eos> and it leads you all the way home <eos> its a war in there <eos> its a war in there <eos> you can hold me now <eos> you can hold me now its the start of a new life day <eos> oh yeah right like i havent heard that one before <eos> you know everything i try to quit i only want it some more <eos> so i let the weeds grow up call them flowers of the common man <eos> but in my head in my head i can hear the gentle voices say <eos> stop smoking take a deep breath and stop smoking <eos> then you can take more deep breaths stop smoking <eos> spend a few more days with your family and friends <eos> and if you want to keep hitting that high note stop smoking <eos> and i wont do it for another soul no its gotta be me <eos> i want to say when and where theres a mountain to climb <eos> and thank you very much i want to waste my own time <eos> after his way and her way and they left me in the darkest allies <eos> but its time i guess its time cause the voice is getting stronger still <eos> stop smoking time to reach for higher realms stop smoking <eos> time to boycott jesse helms stop smoking <eos> and then you can check no when they ask if you smoke <eos> and all that stuff feels great stop smoking <eos> well theres a door i ran away from for every door i tried <eos> and now i got my guilty conscience and i got my guilty pride <eos> and now you tell me that the world needs my hot my wildest dreams <eos> and all that my mending bones and unschooled heart have to give <eos> so big surprise i just stopped smoking <eos> yeah la dee dah now dont remind me i think im going insane <eos> but i got the guts to leave the cult of beautiful pain <eos> where i danced with seven veils of mysterious pollution <eos> and its hard i think its hard trying to find a life that i can live <eos> janis joplin great spirit lost the wheel stop running <eos> the center could not feel start feeling <eos> i know life can make and break an acid queen <eos> us great spirits gotta watch it stop smoking my house is hard to find but ill give you directions <eos> you can visit sometime down where all that i built surrounds me <eos> just make sure your cars got good shocks <eos> theres steep hills theres potholes theres rocks <eos> i work in the garden my son plays around me <eos> close the gate behind you theres a horse that cant get out <eos> i will see you first is that all right <eos> and can you remember can you remember <eos> this is not the house that pain built <eos> this is not the house that pain built <eos> i was drowning in something i jumped in the rift <eos> and you knew me back then when i spat on my gift but no <eos> its tough and its tiring when you go it alone <eos> i learned about wiring i learned about stone <eos> the building is done but the works never through <eos> and i wont give up no how it reminds me of who i am and where i am now <eos> i remember myself thats the work that i do <eos> on a spring night when the snow is melting <eos> youll see two sets of footprints walking <eos> look at all the stars and turn around and walk home <eos> slowly walk home <eos> this is not the house that pain built <eos> that is not a house that pain built <eos> my friends all think that i holed up and hid <eos> but i tell them i didnt you know i dont think i did no oh i fell in love like they do in the magazines <eos> on a football field it was a long daydream <eos> all my high school spent in faithful disbelief <eos> i know that he looks dumb but hes smart underneath <eos> they say im a bright kid and i have a future <eos> with the puritan blessing of work to be done <eos> but to see him cradling that beer is all that im seeing <eos> but now its college days and now im driving home <eos> with my list of books to read and that selfimportant tone <eos> and my parents i read them like the news <eos> i know where they went wrong and theyre not friends i would choose <eos> and theres a sunset over the mountains <eos> i shout my scorn to the splendorous sky <eos> for how does this light compare to all the world suffering <eos> but now its a working day ive lain those gloves to rest <eos> and now im hanging over the sink with a pregnancy test <eos> you can relax babe results are negative <eos> oh but how i thought of kids who theyd be about where wed live <eos> and i saw them climbing up break neck ridge <eos> they found the neighbors woods for to make them their own <eos> and ill see them dancing across the lawns of my homeland <eos> we found the town in sixteen fortyone <eos> for to farm and to pray and metro north to run <eos> we took the fields the marsh and the moon and the sun <eos> we got to work before the day was done <eos> and ill see them dancing across the lawns of my homeland <eos> i am an american <eos> from the fourth grade turkey pageant to the protest march i stand <eos> i am an american <eos> i know theres blood in the pavement and weve turned the fields to sand <eos> hey i know where i come from but i have a question <eos> shall we the people never come home <eos> for after all that weve been are the dreams to come after stopped pretending <eos> happy ending <eos> everything i ever wanted stands in front of me <eos> i have lost my dreams <eos> i have lost my dreams <eos> now they say i told the truth <eos> life beyond the burden of proof <eos> paper thin blue skies and windless fields <eos> i have lost my dreams <eos> i have lost my dreams <eos> traffic crawling <eos> life is moving <eos> up through stately trees into their green leaves <eos> find a new dream <eos> find a new dream <eos> i have lost my dreams <eos> i have lost my dreams how can i ask love to hold the mystery <eos> when just look at me <eos> its all push and pull collateral <eos> i dont want to be the one who gets the next surprise <eos> ill plan it out this time <eos> though i used to think that things were meant to be <eos> so farewell to the old me <eos> farewell to the old me <eos> my life is working better now <eos> its always changing anyhow <eos> i danced a lot of nights until the grass was wet <eos> it wasnt over yet <eos> round bout am you made a friend <eos> and i followed a lot of vital crazy thoughts <eos> because its where the meaning was <eos> and i tried to find it every other way <eos> so farewell to the old me <eos> farewell to the old me <eos> my life is getting better now <eos> but always changing anyhow <eos> but i can turn on the charm <eos> show them nothing more <eos> than what ive done before <eos> its nothing much new <eos> but itll do <eos> cause i dont want to be the one who makes you laugh out loud <eos> i want to make you proud <eos> and you always said you knew what i could be <eos> so farewell to the old me <eos> farewell to the old me <eos> farewell to the old me <eos> my life is working better now <eos> but always changing anyhow <eos> time <eos> and the old me <eos> farewell to the old me <eos> farewell i asked the habitual party goer just how high she thought shed get <eos> and i asked the ethereal girls if they were floating yet <eos> and so i asked the light of the day whats this rush for heaven <eos> then i saw a bird fly away and i could not ask again <eos> the tabloid tainted actress knows the myth of higher ground <eos> the thing she got from playing a nun she got from sleeping around <eos> and so i asked the light of the day whats this rush for heaven <eos> then i saw a bird fly away and i could not ask again <eos> and ive been running uphill panting punching at the air <eos> fighting whats been pushing me down like i can see it there <eos> and so i asked the light of the day whats this rush for heaven <eos> then i saw a bird fly away and i could not ask again <eos> and i saw all this climbing climbing just as far from heaven <eos> then i saw a bird fly away and i started climbing again if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream <eos> inside my lonely room there is no in between <eos> whispering pines rising of the tide <eos> if only one star shines <eos> thats just enough to get inside <eos> i will wait until it all goes around <eos> with you in sight the lost are found <eos> foghorn through the night calling out to sea <eos> protect my only light cause she once belonged to me <eos> let the waves rush in let the seagulls cry <eos> for if i live again these hopes will never die <eos> i can feel you standing there <eos> but i dont see you anywhere <eos> standing by the well wishing for the rains <eos> reaching for the clouds for nothing else remains <eos> drifting in a daze when evening will be done <eos> try looking through a haze <eos> at an empty house in the cold cold sun <eos> i will wait until it all goes around <eos> with you in sight the lost are found we could pretend that were walking on petals and light golden light <eos> flaunting our love like a dance step mastered turning from left to right <eos> but after all the colored lights are gone <eos> time will leave the ashes and the dawn <eos> you rise and meet the day <eos> im watching you go its like spying on hope ever onward with more to burn <eos> giving your hands and your heart to the weave of the world though it fights each turn <eos> but you do not give up so easily <eos> thats how i know you wont surrender me <eos> you rise and meet the day <eos> its all i need its all i need to know its all i need to know <eos> and i love you all the time <eos> i had always feared that some gloomy ingratitude would seize me <eos> but you have held the dream like every morning finds <eos> a way to hang the sun up in the sky <eos> and now i think i have it too <eos> the greatest part i learned from you <eos> you rise and meet the day <eos> and i can see kids maybe yours maybe not oh oh oh <eos> i can hear what theyll say <eos> laughing at pictures with the oldfashioned hats <eos> and the clothes that were wearing today <eos> and they will know the true and humble power <eos> of love that made it through the darkest hour <eos> you rise and meet the day <eos> its all i need its all i need to know its all i need to know i saw your flag <eos> another star another stripe <eos> whats your new bag <eos> something real

leaving gods bright stamp <eos> on peach branch horse and bible camp <eos> where were splashing in the water <eos> joined in song <eos> swimming with the spirit the whole day long <eos> im a teen for god <eos> god is watching teen for god <eos> god is watching teen for god <eos> the girls have looks and the girls have rules <eos> they came here from their bible schools <eos> they can make you pay attention <eos> to the way you dress and eat <eos> make you trip over your own two feet and they <eos> kneel down on their towels at night <eos> their nightgowns glow with a holy light <eos> and we pray for the sinners <eos> and their drunken car wrecks <eos> and vow that ill never get high <eos> and have sex <eos> im a teen for god <eos> god is watching teen for god <eos> god is watching teen for god <eos> and god made every leaf on every tree <eos> each grain of sand <eos> god has a plan <eos> for what were meant to be <eos> i gotta wait for god <eos> dear lord <eos> i plan each day <eos> the things i will not do or say <eos> but im driven by a passion <eos> is it only there to tame <eos> it fills my heart and it calls my name and <eos> this world that you made for us <eos> i know i know is dangerous <eos> so i ride a lot of horses <eos> and i never even swear <eos> sorta like praying im just not there <eos> oh god <eos> god is watching oh god <eos> god is watching <eos> but god made love <eos> god made the rivers run <eos> and cowboy boots and bathing suits <eos> and the boys skin dries in the sun <eos> you gotta help me god <eos> help me know four years from now <eos> i wont believe in you anyhow <eos> and ill mope around the campus <eos> and ill feel betrayed <eos> all those guilty summers i stayed <eos> but then ill laugh <eos> that i fell for the lure <eos> of the pain of desire to feel so pure <eos> and ill bear all the burdens <eos> of my little daily crimes <eos> wish i had a god for such cynical times <eos> far from today <eos> but for now im a sacred vessel <eos> rip me open i spread your word <eos> like a milkweed pod <eos> im a radio station <eos> your holy transmission <eos> even more like a lightning rod <eos> im a lightning rod a teen for god <eos> god is watching teen for god <eos> god is watching a teen for god every time you love just a little <eos> take one step closer solving a riddle <eos> it echoes all over the world <eos> every time you opt in to kindness <eos> make one connection used to divide us <eos> it echoes all over the world <eos> every time you choose one more morning <eos> goodness or meanness life has one warning <eos> it echoes all over the world <eos> when a leader gets the hungry fed food <eos> when you just make love inside your bedroom <eos> it echoes all over the world out where the children all get their own rooms <eos> where they stir coffee with old silver spoons in their mansions <eos> theres a girl that the whole town can see doesnt fit in <eos> but they all know that she understands them <eos> and they want to know <eos> where the kid came from <eos> she wont tell anyone <eos> but they know shes a liar <eos> thats what they know <eos> shes a liar <eos> thats what they know <eos> you do what you have to do <eos> maybe you could be a liar too <eos> theres a school where she goes every day <eos> everything that you could want if you pay you can find there <eos> she came in with a dream and a plan <eos> learned how to use movie cameras and started to shine there <eos> and they want to know <eos> where the kid came from <eos> she wont tell anyone <eos> but they know shes a liar <eos> thats what they know <eos> shes a liar <eos> thats what they know <eos> and if she had to <eos> she could turn the camera right on you <eos> as for the teachers they all knew her crime <eos> when she was everyday always on time they saw through her <eos> she took the train from the city at dawn <eos> broke through the woods and crept through the lawns to her future <eos> so maybe they know <eos> where the kid came from <eos> they wont tell anyone <eos> and they know shes a liar <eos> thats what they know <eos> shes a liar <eos> just because <eos> she reached higher <eos> they are so proud of their liar <eos> they are so proud <eos> you do what you have to do <eos> maybe you could be a liar too i never had a friend as close as you <eos> so close to my heart <eos> i dropped everything when you came through <eos> so close to my heart <eos> and i put my pens and my paint box aside <eos> oh so close to my heart <eos> and the river that ran down the rock face dried <eos> oh so close to my heart <eos> when you were close to my heart <eos> it was an honor that you ran so free <eos> so close to my heart <eos> i thought id lost something forever silly me <eos> so close to my heart <eos> but the place you hid in as bare as it seems <eos> so close to my heart <eos> it held my will in its infinite dreams <eos> so close to my heart <eos> when you were close to my heart <eos> so now youre gone and now well both find our ways <eos> so close to our hearts <eos> by the forge that leaves a stamp on each day <eos> so close to our hearts <eos> and well long to make great things in our lives <eos> so close to our hearts <eos> and well wonder if what we make survives <eos> oh to the beat of the heart <eos> its the work of the heart <eos> but you were close to my heart if were lucky we feel our lives <eos> know when the next scene arrives <eos> so often we start in the middle and work our way out <eos> we go to some grey sky diner for eggs and toast <eos> new york times or the new york post <eos> then we take a ride through the valley of the shadow of death <eos> but even for us new yorkers theres a time in every day <eos> the river takes our breath away <eos> chorus <eos> and the hudson it holds the life <eos> we thought we did it on our own <eos> the river roads collect the tolls <eos> for the passage of our souls <eos> through silence over woods through flowers and snow <eos> and past the george washington bridge <eos> down from the trails of breakneck ridge <eos> the rivers ancient path is sacred and slow <eos> and as it swings through harlem <eos> its every shade of blue <eos> into the city of the new brand new <eos> and the hudson it holds the life <eos> we thought we did it on our own <eos> i thought i had no sense of place or past <eos> time was too slow but then too fast <eos> the river takes us home at last <eos> where and when does the memory take hold <eos> mountain range in the autumn cold <eos> and i thought west point was camelot in the spring <eos> if youre lucky youll find something that reflects you <eos> helps you feel your life protects you <eos> cradles you and connects you to everything <eos> this whole life i remember as they begged them to itself <eos> never turn me into someone else <eos> chorus x two sides of a river <eos> the river rushes through <eos> two sides of a river <eos> one for me and one for you <eos> we can build a bridge or baby <eos> we can jump in <eos> see what the river do <eos> its two sides of a river <eos> great big river rushin through <eos> i know the tides of the river <eos> know how fast and how deep <eos> i know the tides of a river <eos> hope and pray they dont shift in your sleep <eos> cause the river bides its lonely loss <eos> it has no vows to keep <eos> i know the tides of a river <eos> pray pray they dont shift in your sleep <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> before i ever met you <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> where it took me was all that i knew <eos> now i finally found a love to share my secrets with <eos> lots of things we can do <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> thats where i learned to rock you <eos> now i finally found a love to share my secrets with <eos> lots of things we can do <eos> i was a bride of the river <eos> thats where i learned to rock you how did we lose this great right <eos> everything burns in our past <eos> the balance we broke <eos> left us running through smoke <eos> youre at the blue light of the flame <eos> as the earth melted the poles <eos> i raise to mend the controls <eos> and i work harder fiercer and smarter <eos> you are at the blue light of the flame <eos> so this is where it all ends <eos> with the flowers by your belt <eos> and your friends come to you <eos> as the light turns to dark <eos> but the light shines through <eos> yes when the hurricanes came <eos> we were the gods that we blame <eos> we have all injured file <eos> we feel our desire <eos> you kneel at the blue light of the flame <eos> happy on rescue <eos> somebody left you <eos> looking to the blue light of the flame i tried again i went last night <eos> another date was just not right <eos> and as i drove myself back home <eos> a little voice said "just be alone" <eos> but sometimes i think <eos> i see you in a crowd <eos> its not picture perfect youre just meant for me somehow <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you <eos> oh ill miss you till i meet you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> i love the world just as it is <eos> and i wont lose my faith in it <eos> but there are days i think of you <eos> saying "hey thats beautiful yeah i see it too" <eos> it all goes by so fast like waving hands <eos> wanna capture things <eos> find someone who understands <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you <eos> oh ill miss you till i meet you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> can you keep me awake <eos> i thought you could help <eos> just to feel my way <eos> find my better self <eos> oh ill miss you <eos> oh ill miss you <eos> i miss you all the time <eos> the mornings gone <eos> all dreamed away <eos> but thats all right <eos> its saturday <eos> when people think <eos> that they might see <eos> the next chapter of their destiny <eos> and on monday morning comes around <eos> get the work done but i listen for the sound <eos> and ill miss you till i meet you whos afraid of the sun <eos> whod question the goodness of the mighty <eos> we who banish the threat <eos> when your little ones all go nightynighty <eos> well theres no time for doubt right now <eos> and less time to explain <eos> so get back on your horses <eos> kiss my ring join our next campaign <eos> and the empire grows with the news that were winning <eos> with more fear to conquer <eos> and more gold thread for spinning <eos> bright as the sun shining on everyone <eos> some would say that we forced our words <eos> and we find that ingenuously churlish <eos> words are just words <eos> dont be so pessimistic weak and girlish <eos> we like strong happy people <eos> who dont think theres something wrong with pride <eos> work makes them free <eos> and we spread that freedom far and wide <eos> and the empire grows <eos> the seeds of its glory <eos> for every five tanks <eos> plant a sentimental story <eos> till they worship the sun <eos> even christloving ones <eos> and well kill the terror who rises <eos> and a million of their races <eos> but when our people torture you <eos> thats a few random cases <eos> dont question the sun <eos> it doesnt help anyone <eos> but the journalist cried out <eos> when it was too late to stop us <eos> everyone had awakened <eos> to the dream they could enter our colossus <eos> and now im right <eos> here you said im right <eos> theres nothing that can harm me <eos> cause the sun never sets <eos> on my dungeons or my army <eos> and the empire fell <eos> on its own splintered axis <eos> and the emperor wanes <eos> as the silver moon waxes <eos> and the farmers will find our coins <eos> in their strawberry fields <eos> while somebody somewhere <eos> twists his ring as someone kneels <eos> oh where is the sun shining for everyone <eos> oh where is the sun shining for everyone i think id like to go back home <eos> and take it easy <eos> theres a woman that id like to get to know <eos> living there <eos> everybody seems to wonder <eos> what its like down here <eos> i gotta get away <eos> from this daytoday <eos> running around <eos> everybody knows this is nowhere <eos> everybody everybody knows <eos> every time i think about back home <eos> its cool and breezy <eos> i wish that i could be there right now <eos> passing time <eos> everybody seems to wonder <eos> what its like down here <eos> i gotta get away <eos> from this daytoday <eos> running around <eos> everybody knows this is nowhere <eos> everybody everybody knows <eos> everybody knows <eos> i think id like to go back home <eos> and take it easy <eos> theres a woman that id like to get

<eos> everybody everybody knows <eos> everybody knows <eos> repeat until ending the moon wanted more of my night <eos> i turned off the engine and the headlights <eos> the trees appeared as theyd never been gone <eos> i promised the fields id return from now on <eos> and the moon kept on rising <eos> i had no more to say <eos> i put my road maps away <eos> and surrendered the day <eos> and i know youll be calling me soon <eos> and if i dont answer im calling the moon <eos> calling the moon <eos> i was calling her then <eos> im wondering will she take me again <eos> oh i am calling the moon <eos> when i called the moon back to me <eos> i thought she wanted my beauty <eos> i shone in the best that vanity buys <eos> i covered the path where my life turned to lies <eos> and the moon kept on rising <eos> but i felt nothing at all <eos> she comes when the empire falls <eos> and shines on crumbling walls <eos> calling the moon <eos> by the name that she chose <eos> as tennessee wandered in motheaten robes <eos> oh i am calling the moon <eos> calling the moon <eos> oh im calling the moon <eos> oh make sense of me night <eos> i can see so much from this cold height <eos> the moon said oh darkness my work is done <eos> ive poured this bottle of light from the sun <eos> but their anger keeps on rising <eos> and they dont understand <eos> ive shown them all that i can <eos> that the world is at hand <eos> and i know theyll be calling me soon <eos> and if i dont answer im only the moon <eos> i can see by her light <eos> this ones going out to the moon tonight <eos> oh i am calling the moon <eos> calling the moon <eos> cause i know what its worth <eos> to tug at the seas and illumine the earth <eos> oh i am calling the moon <eos> oh i am calling the moon tonight was just great <eos> she taught us the sign for peace <eos> now shes made us some popcorn <eos> weve turned out the lights and were watching movies <eos> i dont understand and she tries to explain <eos> how a spaceship is riding through somebodys brain <eos> and their blood and guts and oh <eos> shes the best one that weve ever had <eos> she sits on her hair <eos> and shes tall as my dad <eos> and she tiedied my shirt <eos> and pierced her own ear <eos> and its peace man cool yeah the babysitters here <eos> her boyfriend is tom but we call him the king of romance <eos> he wears an american flag on the butt of his ripped up pants <eos> and will they get married with kids of their own <eos> he says "not if shes going to college we wont" <eos> and he kisses her oh <eos> someday ill have a boyfriend just like that <eos> shes the best one that weve ever had <eos> she sits on her hair and shes tall as my dad <eos> and she got mad at dinner when tom drank a beer <eos> but peace man cool hey the babysitters here <eos> and we all went to see her go dance at the high school <eos> we made her a big <eos> and she told us that shed be the unicorn wearing the pink leotard <eos> and there she was leaping up just like she said <eos> with a sparking horn coming out of her head <eos> and shes ohoh oh uh oh <eos> i cant wait to give her card i cant wait to give her the card <eos> shes the best one <eos> ok so the play was called the unicorn <eos> and she was the unicorn <eos> that means the starwas my babysitter <eos> but its saturday night <eos> i cant sleep and were watching the news <eos> she says "do me a favor <eos> dont go with a boy who would make you choose" <eos> and i dont understand and she tries to explain <eos> and all that mascara runs down in her pain <eos> cause shes leaving me oh no <eos> youre the best one that weve ever had <eos> you sit on your <eos> and youre tall as my dad <eos> and ill make you a picture for college next year <eos> so hush now peace man the babysitters here <eos> the best babysitters here <eos> we will see the spinache <eos> just sometimes though not all the time the summer ends and we wonder where we are <eos> and there you go my friends with your boxes in your car <eos> and you both look so young <eos> and last night was hard you said <eos> you packed up every room <eos> and then you cried and went to bed <eos> but today you closed the door and said <eos> "we have to get a move on <eos> its just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead <eos> we push ourselves ahead" <eos> and it was cloudy in the morning <eos> and it rained as you drove away <eos> and the same things looked different <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you move to another place <eos> and i feel like the neighbors girl who will never be the same <eos> she walked alone all spring <eos> she had a boyfriend when the summer came <eos> and he gave her flowers in a lightning storm <eos> they disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn <eos> and sometime in july she just forgot that he was leaving <eos> so when the fields were dying she held on to his sleeves <eos> she held on to his sleeves <eos> and she doesnt want to let go <eos> cause she wont know what shes up against <eos> the classrooms and the smart girls <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you hang your flowers up to dry <eos> and i had a dream it blows the autumn through my head <eos> it felt like the first day of school <eos> but i was going to the moon instead <eos> and i walked down the hall <eos> with the notebooks they got for me <eos> my dad led me through the house <eos> my mom drank instant coffee <eos> and i knew that i would crash <eos> but i didnt want to tell them <eos> there are just some moments when your family makes sense <eos> they just make sense <eos> so i raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on <eos> we walked out on the dark and frozen grass <eos> the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you send your children to the moon <eos> the summer ends and we wonder who we are <eos> and there you go my friends with your boxes in your car <eos> and today i passed the high school the river the maple tree <eos> i passed the farms that made it <eos> through the last days of the century <eos> and i knew that i was going to learn again <eos> again in this less hazy light <eos> i saw the fields beyond the fields <eos> the fields beyond the fields <eos> and the colors are much brighter now <eos> its like they really want to tell the truth <eos> we give our testimony to the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> you can spin the light to gold time it was i had a dream and youre the dream come true <eos> if i had the world to give id give it all to you <eos> ill take you to the mountains i will take you to the sea <eos> ill show you how this life became a miracle to me <eos> youll fly away but take my hand until that day <eos> so when they ask how far love goes <eos> when my jobs done youll be the one who knows <eos> all the things you treasure most will be the hardest won <eos> i will watch you struggle long before the answers come <eos> but i wont make it harder ill be there to cheer you on <eos> ill shine the light that guides you down the road youre walking on <eos> youll fly away but take my hand until that day so when they ask how far love goes <eos> when my jobs done youll be the one who knows <eos> before the mountains call to you before you leave this home <eos> i want to teach your heart to trust as i will teach my own <eos> but sometimes i will ask the moon where it shined upon you last <eos> and shake my head and laugh and say it all went by too fast <eos> youll fly away but take my hand until that day so when they ask how far love goes <eos> when my jobs done youll be the one who knows oh my fair north star <eos> i have held to you dearly <eos> i had asked you to steer me <eos> till one cloudscattered night <eos> i got lost and in my travels i met leo the lion <eos> met a king and met a giant with their errant light <eos> theres the wind and the rain and the mercy of the fallen <eos> who say they have no claim to know whats right <eos> theres the weak and the strong and the beds that have no answer <eos> and thats where i may rest my head tonight <eos> i saw all the bright people <eos> in imposing flocks they landed <eos> and they got what they demanded <eos> and they scratched at the ground <eos> then they flew and the field grew as sweetly for the flightless <eos> who had longing yet despite this <eos> they could hear every sound <eos> theres the wind and the rain <eos> and the mercy of the fallen <eos> who say they have no claim to know whats right <eos> theres the weak and the strong and the beds that have no answer <eos> and thats where i may rest my head tonight <eos> if your sister or your brother were stumbling on their last mile <eos> in a selfinflicted exile <eos> youd hope theyd meet a humble friend <eos> and i hope someday that the best of falstaffs planners <eos> give me seven halfbuilt manors <eos> where halfdreams may dream without end <eos> theres the wind and the rain and the mercy of the fallen <eos> who say they have no claim to know whats right <eos> theres the weak and the strong and the many stars that guide us <eos> we have some of them inside us i dont go to therapy to find out if im a freak <eos> i go and i find the one and only answer every week <eos> and its just me and all the memories to follow <eos> down any course that fits within a fifty minute hour <eos> and we fathom all the mysteries explicit and inherent <eos> when i hit a rut she says to try the other parent <eos> and shes so kind i think she wants to tell me something <eos> but she knows that its much better if i get it for myself <eos> and she says <eos> what do you hear in these sounds <eos> what do you hear in these sounds <eos> i say i hear a doubt with the voice of true believing <eos> and the promises to stay and the footsteps that are leaving <eos> and she says "oh" i say "what" she says "exactly" <eos> i say "what you think im angry <eos> does that mean you think im angry" <eos> she says "look you come here every week <eos> with jigsaw pieces of your past <eos> its all on little soundbites and voices out of photographs <eos> and thats all yours thats the guide thats the map <eos> so tell me where does the arrow point to <eos> who invented roses" <eos> and <eos> what do you hear in these sounds <eos> what do you hear in these sounds <eos> and when i talk about therapy i know what people think <eos> that it only makes you selfish and in love with your shrink <eos> but oh how i loved everybody else <eos> when i finally got to talk so much about myself <eos> and i wake up and i ask myself what state im in <eos> and i say well im lucky cause i am like east berlin <eos> i had this wall and what i knew of the free world <eos> was that i could see their fireworks <eos> and i could hear their radio <eos> and i thought that if we met i would only start confessing <eos> and theyd know that i was scared <eos> theyd would know that i was guessing <eos> but the wall came down and there they stood before me <eos> with their stumbling and their mumbling <eos> and their calling out just like me and <eos> the stories that nobody hears and <eos> i collect these sounds in my ears and <eos> thats what i hear in these sounds and <eos> thats what i hear in these <eos> thats what i hear in these sounds i threw your keys in the water i looked back <eos> theyd frozen halfway down in the ice <eos> they froze up so quickly the keys and their owners <eos> even after the anger it all turned silent and <eos> the everyday turned solitary <eos> so we came to february <eos> first we forgot where wed planted those bulbs last year <eos> then we forgot that wed planted at all <eos> then we forgot what plants are altogether <eos> and i blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and <eos> the nights were long and cold and scary <eos> can we live through february <eos> you know i think christmas was a long red glare <eos> shot up like a warning we gave presents without cards <eos> and then the snow <eos> and then the snow came we were always out shoveling <eos> and wed drop to sleep exhausted <eos> then wed wake up and its snowing <eos> and february was so long that it lasted into march <eos> and found us walking a path alone together <eos> you stopped and pointed and you said "thats a crocus" <eos> and i said "whats a crocus" and you said "its a flower" <eos> i tried to remember but i said "whats a flower" <eos> you said "i still love you" heres wishing you the bluest sky <eos> and hoping something better comes tomorrow <eos> hoping all the verses rhyme <eos> and the very best of choruses to <eos> follow all the doubt and sadness <eos> i know that better things are on their way <eos> heres hoping that the days ahead <eos> wont be as bitter as the ones behind you <eos> be an optimist instead <eos> and somehow happiness will find you <eos> forget what happened yesterday <eos> i know that better things are on their way <eos> its really good to see you rocking out <eos> and having fun <eos> living like youve just begun <eos> accept your life and what it brings <eos> i hope tomorrow you find better things <eos> i know tomorrow youll find better things <eos> heres wishing you the bluest sky <eos> and hoping something better comes tomorrow <eos> hoping all the verses rhyme <eos> and the very best of choruses to <eos> follow all the drudge and sadness <eos> i know that better things are on the way go ahead push your luck <eos> find out how much love the world can hold <eos> once upon a time i had control and reined my soul in tight <eos> well the whole truth <eos> is like the story of a wave unfurled <eos> but i held the evil of the world <eos> so i stopped the tide <eos> froze it up from inside <eos> and it felt like <eos> a winter machine that you go through and then <eos> you catch your breath and winter starts again <eos> and everyone else is spring bound <eos> but when i chose to live <eos> there was no joy its just a line i crossed <eos> it wasnt worth the pain my death would cost <eos> so i was not lost or found <eos> and if i was to sleep <eos> i knew my family had more truth to tell <eos> and so i traveled down a whispering well <eos> to know myself through them <eos> growing up my mom had a room full of books <eos> and hid away in there <eos> her father raging down a spiral stair <eos> till he found someone most days his son <eos> and sometimes i think my father too is a refugee <eos> i know they tried to keep their pain from me <eos> they could not see what it was for <eos> but now im sleeping fine <eos> sometimes the truth is like a second chance <eos> i am the daughter of a great romance <eos> and they are the children of the war <eos> well the sun rose <eos> with so many colors it nearly broke my heart <eos> it worked me over like a work of art <eos> and i was apart of all that <eos> so go ahead push your luck <eos> say what it is you gotta say to me <eos> we will push on into that mystery <eos> and it will push right back <eos> and there are worse things than that <eos> cause for every price and every penance that i could think of <eos> its better to have fallen in love <eos> than never to have fallen at all <eos> cause when you live in a world <eos> well it gets in to who you thought youd be <eos> and now i laugh at how the world changed me <eos> i think life chose me <eos> after all you can leave this house leave this town <eos> leave it all to me or youll never leave the ground <eos> look at that tiny screens too small for you <eos> i think you should learn to dream just like the dreamers do <eos> what can you do with a day <eos> what will you wake up and see <eos> the farther you get the closer to me <eos> am i the habit youre too tired to break <eos> i want you to love me with every step you take <eos> what can you do with a day <eos> what will you wake up and see <eos> the farther you get the closer to me <eos> taj mahal cameroon back in time <eos> to the moon frozen lake cypress trees <eos> floridas missing keys el dorado <eos> spain or bust eiffel tower paris just find your

<eos> and thats when i came back to town this town is a song about you <eos> you dont know how lucky you are you dont know how much i adore you <eos> you are the welcoming back from the ocean <eos> i went back to the ocean today <eos> with my books and my papers i went to the rocks by the ocean <eos> but the weather changed quickly oh the ocean said <eos> "what are you trying to find i dont care im not kind <eos> ive bludgeoned your sailors ive spat out their keepsakes <eos> oh its ashes to ashes but always the ocean" <eos> but the ocean cant come to this town this town is a song about you <eos> you dont know how lucky you are you dont know how much i adore you <eos> you are the welcoming back from the ocean <eos> and the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole <eos> i have a good and i have an evil i thought the ocean the ocean thought nothing <eos> you are the welcoming back from the ocean <eos> i didnt go back today <eos> i wanted to show you that i was more land than water <eos> i went to pick flowers i brought them to you <eos> look at me look at them with their salt up the stem <eos> but you frowned when i smiled and i tried to arrange them <eos> you said "let me tell you the song of this town" <eos> you said "everything closes at five after that well you just got the bars <eos> you dont know how precious you are walking around with your little shoes dangling <eos> i am the one who lives with the ocean i wont forget when peter pan came to my house took my hand <eos> i said i was a boy im glad he didnt check <eos> i learned to fly i learned to fight <eos> i lived a whole life in one night <eos> we saved each others lives out on the pirates deck <eos> and i remember that night <eos> when im leaving a late night with some friends <eos> and i hear somebody tell me its not safe someone should help me <eos> i need to find a nice man to walk me home <eos> when i was a boy i scared the pants off of my mom <eos> climbed what i could climb upon <eos> and i dont know how i survived <eos> i guess i knew the tricks that all boys knew <eos> and you can walk me home but i was a boy too <eos> i was a kid that you would like just a small boy on her bike <eos> riding topless yeah i never cared who saw <eos> my neighbor come outside to say "get your shirt" <eos> i said "no way its the last time im not breaking any law" <eos> and now im in a clothing store and the sign says less is more <eos> more thats tight means more to see more for them not more for me <eos> that cant help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat <eos> when i was a boy see that picture that was me <eos> grassstained shirt and dusty knees <eos> and i know things have gotta change <eos> they got pills to sell theyve got implants to put in theyve got implants to remove <eos> but i am not forgetting <eos> that i was a boy too <eos> and like the woods where i would creep its a secret i can keep <eos> except when im tired except when im being caught off guard <eos> ive had a lonesome awful day the conversation finds its way <eos> to catching fireflies out in the backyard <eos> and i tell the man im with about the other life i lived <eos> and i say now youre top gun i have lost and you have won <eos> and he says "oh no no cant you see <eos> when i was a girl my mom and i we always talked <eos> and i picked flowers everywhere that i walked <eos> and i could always cry now even when im alone i seldom do <eos> and i have lost some kindness <eos> but i was a girl too <eos> and you were just like me and i was just like you im sorry that i left you <eos> with your questions all alone <eos> but i was too happy driving <eos> and too angry to drive home <eos> i was thinking about the easy courage <eos> of my distant friends <eos> they said i could let this bridge wash out <eos> and never make amends <eos> can i blow this small town <eos> make a big sound <eos> like the star of a film noir postcard <eos> can i just forget the frames i shared with you <eos> and i cant believe what theyre saying <eos> theyre saying i can change my mind <eos> start over on spring street <eos> im welcome anytime <eos> well there are spring street storefront daisies <eos> floating on their neon stems <eos> there are new shirts on the clothes racks <eos> should i feel like one of them <eos> i can find a small apartment <eos> where a struggling artist died <eos> and pretend because i pay the rent <eos> i know that pain inside <eos> yeah lets watch the tour bus stop and tell us <eos> heres the scene of a spring green life dream <eos> take the best part <eos> write it in your caffeine diary <eos> and i cant believe what theyre saying <eos> theyre saying i can leave tonight <eos> start over on spring street <eos> im welcome anytime <eos> this year april had a blizzard <eos> just to show she did not care <eos> and the new dead leaves <eos> they made the trees look like children with gray hair <eos> but ill push myself up through the dirt <eos> and shake my petals free <eos> im resolved to being born <eos> and so resigned to bravery <eos> yeah the one who leaves this also grieves this <eos> too much rain on a prairie flood plain <eos> houses floating love is like that <eos> we built on the river <eos> and thats to say yeah im leaving <eos> but i dont have to go there <eos> i dont have to go to spring street <eos> cause its spring everywhere i never thought you were the letter writing type <eos> so now i see the words you chose the way you write <eos> so i started to write back about the trees in the snow <eos> and i saw a bird couldnt see what it was but i thought youd know <eos> you always surprised me <eos> and if i wrote you <eos> if i wrote you <eos> you would know me <eos> and you would not write me again <eos> and when the spring came and flooded all the streams <eos> its like how you got the night you told me all your dreams <eos> and when the barn roof sagged after an icy bout <eos> its like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out <eos> but not the only way <eos> and if i wrote you <eos> if i wrote you <eos> you would know me <eos> and you would not write me again <eos> we drew our arms around the bastard sons <eos> we never would drink to the chosen ones <eos> well you know the way i left was not the way i planned <eos> but i thought the world needed love and a steady hand <eos> so im steady now <eos> and im so happy <eos> i had to tell you <eos> and i love you <eos> and you will not write me again <eos> you will not write me again <eos> you will not write me again perhaps i am a miscreation <eos> no one knows the truth there is no future here <eos> and youre the dj speaks to my insomnia <eos> and laughs at all i have to fear <eos> laughs at all i have to fear <eos> you always play the madmen poets <eos> vinyl vision grungy bands <eos> you never know whos still awake <eos> you never know who understands and <eos> are you out there can you hear this <eos> jimmy olson johnny memphis <eos> i was out here listening all the time <eos> and though the static walls surround me <eos> you were out there and you found me <eos> i was out here listening all the time <eos> last night we drank in parking lots <eos> and why do we drink i guess we do it cause <eos> and when i turned your station on <eos> you sounded more familiar than that party was <eos> you were more familiar than that party <eos> its the first time i stayed up all night <eos> its getting light i hear the birds <eos> im driving home on empty streets <eos> i think i put my shirt on backwards <eos> are you out there can you hear this <eos> jimmy olson johnny memphis <eos> i was out here listening all the time <eos> and though the static walls surround me <eos> you were out there and you found me <eos> i was out here listening all the time <eos> and whats the future who will choose it <eos> politics of love and music <eos> underdogs who turn the tables <eos> indie versus major labels <eos> theres so much to see through <eos> like our parents do more drugs than we do <eos> oh <eos> corporate parents corporate towns <eos> i know every tv set that has them lit <eos> they preach that i should save the world <eos> they pray that i wont do a better job of it <eos> pray that i wont do a better job <eos> so tonight i turned your station on just so id be understood <eos> instead another voice said i was just too late <eos> and just no good <eos> calling olson calling memphis <eos> i am calling can you hear this <eos> i was out here listening all the time <eos> and i will write this down <eos> and then i will not be alone again yeah <eos> i was out here listening <eos> oh yeah i was out here listening <eos> oh yeah i am out here listening all the time amber called her uncle <eos> said "were up here for the holiday <eos> jane and i were having solstice <eos> now we need a place to stay" <eos> and her christloving uncle <eos> watched his wife hang mary on a tree <eos> he watched his son hang candy canes <eos> all made with red dye number three <eos> he told his niece "its christmas eve <eos> i know our life is not your style" <eos> she said "christmas is like solstice <eos> and we miss you and its been awhile" <eos> so the christians and the pagans <eos> sat together at the table <eos> finding faith and common ground <eos> the best that they were able <eos> and just before the meal was served <eos> hands were held and prayers were said <eos> sending hope for peace on earth <eos> to all their gods and goddesses <eos> the food was great the tree plugged in <eos> the meal had gone without a hitch <eos> till timmy turned to amber and said <eos> "is it true that youre a witch" <eos> his mom jumped up and said <eos> "the pies are burning" and she hit the kitchen <eos> and it was jane who spoke she said <eos> "its true your cousins not a christian" <eos> "but we love trees we love the snow <eos> the friends we have the world we share <eos> and you find magic from your god <eos> and we find magic everywhere" <eos> so the christians and the pagans <eos> sat together at the table <eos> finding faith and common ground <eos> the best that they were able <eos> and where does magic come from <eos> i think magics in the learning <eos> cause now when christians sit with pagans <eos> only pumpkin pies are burning <eos> when amber tried to do the dishes <eos> her aunt said "really no dont bother" <eos> ambers uncle saw how amber looked like <eos> tim and like her father <eos> he thought about his brother <eos> how they hadnt spoken in a year <eos> he thought hed call him up and say <eos> "its christmas and your daughters here" <eos> he thought of fathers sons and brothers <eos> saw his own son tug his sleeve saying <eos> "can i be a pagan" dad said <eos> "well discuss it when they leave" <eos> so the christians and the pagans <eos> sat together at the table <eos> finding faith and common ground <eos> the best that they were able <eos> lighting trees in darkness <eos> learning new ways from the old <eos> and making sense of history <eos> and drawing warmth out of the cold the summer ends and we wonder where we are <eos> and there you go my friends with your boxes in your car <eos> and you both look so young <eos> and last night was hard you said <eos> you packed up every room <eos> and then you cried and went to bed <eos> but today you closed the door and said <eos> "we have to get a move on <eos> its just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead <eos> we push ourselves ahead" <eos> and it was cloudy in the morning <eos> and it rained as you drove away <eos> and the same things looked different <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you move to another place <eos> and i feel like the neighbors girl who will never be the same <eos> she walked alone all spring <eos> she had a boyfriend when the summer came <eos> and he gave her flowers in a lightning storm <eos> they disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn <eos> and sometime in july she just forgot that he was leaving <eos> so when the fields were dying she held on to his sleeves <eos> she held on to his sleeves <eos> and she doesnt want to let go <eos> cause she wont know what shes up against <eos> the classrooms and the smart girls <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you hang your flowers up to dry <eos> and i had a dream it blows the autumn through my head <eos> it felt like the first day of school <eos> but i was going to the moon instead <eos> and i walked down the hall <eos> with the notebooks they got for me <eos> my dad led me through the house <eos> my mom drank instant coffee <eos> and i knew that i would crash <eos> but i didnt want to tell them <eos> there are just some moments when your family makes sense <eos> they just make sense <eos> so i raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on <eos> we walked out on the dark and frozen grass <eos> the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> when you send your children to the moon <eos> the summer ends and we wonder who we are <eos> and there you go my friends with your boxes in your car <eos> and today i passed the high school the river the maple tree <eos> i passed the farms that made it <eos> through the last days of the century <eos> and i knew that i was going to learn again <eos> again in this less hazy light <eos> i saw the fields beyond the fields <eos> the fields beyond the fields <eos> and the colors are much brighter now <eos> its like they really want to tell the truth <eos> we give our testimony to the end of the summer <eos> its the end of the summer <eos> you can spin the light to gold when you know the day is ending all too soon <eos> youre just two umbrellas one late afternoon <eos> you never know what you will say <eos> this is your favorite kind of day <eos> it has no walls the beauty of the rain <eos> is how it falls how it falls how it falls <eos> and theres nothing wrong but there is something more <eos> and sometimes you wonder what you love her for <eos> she says youve known her deepest fears <eos> cause she showed you a box of stainedglass tears <eos> it cant be all the truth about the rain <eos> is how it falls how it falls how it falls <eos> but when she gave you more to find <eos> you let her think shed lost her mind <eos> and thats all on you <eos> feeling helpless if she asked for help <eos> or scared youd have to change yourself <eos> and you cant deny this room will keep you warm <eos> you can look out of your window at the storm <eos> but you watch the phone and hope it rings <eos> youll take her any way she sings <eos> or how she calls the beauty of the rain <eos> is how it falls how it falls how it falls <eos> how it falls how it falls how it falls yea there was a time i didnt like the love i liked the climbers <eos> i was no sister then i was running out of time and one liners <eos> and i was afraid like you are when youre too young to know the time and <eos> so i watched the way you take your fear and hoard the horizon <eos> you point you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on <eos> like you own them just because you bought the time <eos> and you turn to me you say you hope im not threatened <eos> oh im not that petty as cool as i am i thought youd know this already <eos> i will not be afraid of women i will not be afraid of women <eos> so now were at a club you watch the woman dancing she is drunk <eos> she is smiling and shes falling in a slow descending funk <eos> and the whole bar is loud and proud and everybodys trying yeah <eos> you play the artist saying "is it how she moves or how she looks" <eos> i say its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks <eos> and as long as shes got noise shes fine <eos> but i could teach her how i learned to dance when the musics ended <eos> oh and thats not petty as cool as i am i thought youd know this already <eos> i will not be afraid of women i will not be afraid of women <eos> you tried to make me doubt to make me guess tried to make me feel like a little less <eos> oh i liked you when your soul was bared i thought you knew how to be scared <eos> and now its amazing what you did to make me stay <eos> but truth is just like time it catches up and it just keeps going <eos> and so im leaving you can find out how much better things can get <eos> and if it helps id say i feel a little worse than i did when we met <eos> so when you find someone else you can try again it might work next time <eos> you look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low <eos> "if i could believe that stuff id say that woman has a halo" <eos> and i look out and say "yeah shes really blond" <eos> and then i go outside to join the others i am the others <eos> oh and thats not easy i dont know what you saw i want somebody who sees me <eos> i will not be afraid of women i will not be afraid of women oh what have we here he must be three or four <eos> checking out of the booth on his way back to war <eos> and hes not looking for a father or a mother <eos> just a seven year old brother <eos> on this match line border camp of refugees <eos> i am the one who will remember everything <eos> i am the one who will remember everything <eos> so where are we now he must be five or six <eos> just running around hungry kids sharpen sticks <eos> and he will grow with pain and fear and jealousy <eos> taking in by school of zealotry <eos> who trained orphans to make orphans evermore <eos> i am the one who will remember everything <eos> i am the one who will remember everything <eos> i am the one who will remember everything <eos> i am the one who will remember everything have you called before your time <eos> rest your head against me im a friend to travelers <eos> hold me tight my wings are strong <eos> wrap your arms around me <eos> its a long way through the tunnel to the light <eos> speeding through the fields of flowers <eos> silver skies with distant showers <eos> my sister brought them <eos> all the seeds in spring were sown <eos> how the tendriled vines have grown <eos> so full in autumn <eos> may i say you seem too strong <eos> loose your silver hair <eos> cause its a long way through the tunnel to the light <eos> fates are poised above the strings <eos> they know the span of life and wings <eos> you are not of them <eos> see the life these travelers chose <eos> highway lamps on open roads <eos> that shine above them <eos> do your fingers want to feel <eos> tunnels made of dampened steel <eos> and why pretend that youre so dull <eos> may i say youre beautiful <eos> it makes me want to turn this thing around <eos> youll ride with me tonight <eos> you will ride with me tonight <eos> you will ride with me tonight in my life on earth <eos> the things i have invented have invented me <eos> i found my industry <eos> i am not alone <eos> i fashion friends from precious scraps <eos> they hold the light they bend to serve me <eos> joking that they dont deserve me <eos> after days of craft and care <eos> i lift a sword and slice the air <eos> such has been my time upon this earththis earth <eos> then my wife returns <eos> more beautiful then when she left the night before <eos> i show her things i made <eos> the filigree of ferns diamonds snowflakes tears of gold <eos> she murmurs praise a small caress i smile to see her happiness <eos> silver webs with sand engrained <eos> that catch and hold real drops of rain <eos> such has been my toil upon this earththis earth <eos> when im feeling vexed i go upstairs and bury something deep <eos> then stand back and push a button from a distance watch the earth explode <eos> this earth <eos> i love this land of mortal men <eos> they wake to know the fire again <eos> the things we make the things we feel <eos> armored plates and molten steel <eos> all of these inventions of the earththe earththis earth we shook the last drops from glen gariochs finest hour <eos> we sipped it like the blood of burns <eos> through the mountain thyme <eos> belting auld lang syne <eos> this is how ill free myself <eos> ill free myself <eos> youll come to wellfleet where the sun through fairy pines <eos> shines soft and gold as chardonnay <eos> and then well retire <eos> sitting by the fire <eos> this is how ill free myself <eos> ill free myself <eos> this vodka comes from rain descending from a single cloud <eos> these cherries ripened in the groves of the hesperides <eos> where heroes lie <eos> i rolled my pant legs up for darting fish in tadpole ponds <eos> i picked the berries in the field <eos> light pools in my glass <eos> shines into the past <eos> this is how ill this is how ill how ill free myself sitting out upon the waves in darkness and upheaval <eos> i was told that i alone would not know good and evil <eos> oh but in time but oh in time it came to me <eos> as my shepherd fallen rise <eos> i could turn and lift my eyes <eos> to the light that distant light <eos> there will always be <eos> the light and the sea <eos> rolling seathe light and me <eos> and as the days rolled by i turned my wheel toward the thunder <eos> taking on a challenge that i knew could take me under <eos> ohand it took me down and ohit took me down <eos> and it came to me <eos> as i cursed the stem and sail <eos> because its fate that i should fail <eos> there is a lightthere is a light <eos> there will always be the light and the sea <eos> the rolling seathe light and me <eos> and it all comes downdown to me <eos> to feel the presence of my soul <eos> amid the torrents and the cold <eos> of the sea <eos> and there will always be the light and the sea <eos> the rolling seathe light and me <eos> the light and me write this number down you can call it anytime <eos> we have been waiting for the day that you would finally drop the dime <eos> i praise the ones who persevere and seeking justice through the law <eos> i caution there were those who fell to bend and the betrayed by what they saw <eos> some stood in halls of silence with icy hints of violence <eos> when they to seek justice through the law <eos> im witness to the comments and the institutions of the peoples rule <eos> the parents take their kids to local parks and then their kids head off to school <eos> you might see the same old story greed and profits allegory i see kids who go to school <eos> the vote for one the vote for all a right to silence one free call youll need a warrant for

first your heart and then your breath <eos> venturing out scanned a thousand blades of grass <eos> and when you drew your bow string <eos> it was a swift and cordial death <eos> as you stood in the wilderness <eos> did you feel the silence in the stillness <eos> and was me with you in the forest <eos> for you knew the balance the balances before us <eos> i was guarding crystal creek <eos> our tree its a record a home of memories <eos> and every bird springs from an old masters canvas full and flight <eos> and the pond i go to sparkles in a vast estuary <eos> and those men saw nothing <eos> staring drunken through their sights <eos> the one who spied me out as god still plunder <eos> had to show the world that he was not a true hunter <eos> and it was me when he saw me naked <eos> he was interrupting something sacred <eos> i was guarding crystal creek <eos> and the newsmen circled <eos> leaving trails of cigarette butts <eos> machine like up the hill to crystal creek <eos> jane she said who would do this thing <eos> ive seen today i cannot hold my mic <eos> my hands are shaking knees are weak <eos> found a man and he was wrapped in a deerskin <eos> riddled through with boxes of his friends ammunition <eos> turn the camera off she said <eos> and that was me <eos> all my noble animals <eos> you must act with reverence not like cannibals <eos> i was guarding crystal creek the

is coming soon <eos> as we sail the river up and down <eos> the storm king has borne the seasons all <eos> worn them upon his brow <eos> he guides the watchful boats below <eos> i am the storm king now <eos> he is bemused sometimes delighted <eos> sees the trains the hikers on the hill <eos> in our progress and our industry <eos> may we grow better still <eos> the storm king has seen us from above <eos> rising up on the starboard bow <eos> he knows the turning of the years <eos> i am the storm king now well you make my coffee and its only am but soon im going on my way <eos> and my time is almost up i hold my coffee cup we sit with nothing left to say <eos> and i know that soon i will be touching down <eos> in a shining city or a mountain town <eos> i have been around the world but all that i can see <eos> are these moments that we have youre all the world to me <eos> well theres always laughter and the parties after and the fond farewell will before i go <eos> leaving town the window panes they flash like movie frames the last scene in a picture show <eos> but i know that i am not alone and you are the one that i can tell my stories to <eos> i have been around the world theres so much there to see <eos> and the story never ends youre all the world to me <eos> then i know there are times you think ive lost my way but there is no way this can be true <eos> cause when

stores we passed the hotels <eos> filled our car with gasoline <eos> we drove that night i saw the moon <eos> almost got us in an accident <eos> and then at the rest stop <eos> when that woman tried to steal my wallet <eos> it felt like an adventure <eos> isnt that what you would call it <eos> isnt that what you would call it <eos> youre my road buddy but im lonely all the time <eos> i thought wed be joking having long talks on late night drives <eos> but you drive so bad i lost my patience <eos> so pass the chips and turn the station <eos> this is not a romance with the road <eos> where the moss grows up the trees <eos> to where the bird is rusty <eos> i thought wed find each story like a snakeskin or an arrowhead <eos> but we only stop at fast food places <eos> they hate their jobs i understand <eos> they try to act familiar but theyre floating just above the land <eos> and we are all floating <eos> youre my road buddy but im lonely all the time <eos> i thought wed show that friendship could be stronger than the crossroads double back <eos> i thought i heard the tori sing ill take that thing i <eos> this is not a romance with the road <eos> in those cliffs are the same as in the magazines i have at home <eos> and the tall grass reminds me of the same dreams i had at home <eos> i thought life was a road and i wanted to begin it <eos> i said my friend and i going on a trip so i could only stop a minute <eos> we go to the venting machines <eos> i want to watch these kids with their mother <eos> sipping on their juice boxes and smiling at each other <eos> and maybe thats their dad on the phone <eos> saying hey mom you couldnt wait go ahead have dinner <eos> cause were running just a little late <eos> but were on our way <eos> road buddy road buddy i heard about the boxcars and the family of travelers <eos> but theres real estate sides in the cornfields <eos> i know theres love i bet theres trouble <eos> but you just cant spend a lifetime on the road <eos> and theres something i finally faced <eos> i finally think i come from some place <eos> this is not a romance with the road god of the poor man this is how the day began <eos> eight co defendants i daniel berrigan <eos> oh and only a laymans batch of napalm <eos> we pulled the draft files out <eos> we burned them in the parking lot <eos> better the files than the bodies of children <eos> i had no right but for the love of you <eos> i had no right but for the love of you <eos> many roads led here walked with the suffering <eos> tom in guatemala phillip in new orleans <eos> oh its a long road from law to justice <eos> i went to vietnam i went for peace <eos> they dropped their bombs <eos> right where my government knew i would be <eos> i had no right but for the love of you <eos> i had no right but for the love of you <eos> and all my country saw <eos> were priests who broke the law <eos> first it was question then it was a mission <eos> how to be american how to be a christian <eos> oh if their law is their cross and the cross is burning <eos> the love of you <eos> the love of you <eos> god of the just ill never win a peace prize <eos> falling like jesus <eos> now let the jury rise <eos> oh its all of us versus all that paper <eos> they took the only way they know who is on trial today <eos> deliver us unto each other i pray <eos> i had no right but for the love of you <eos> and every trial i stood i stood for you <eos> eyes on the trial <eos> eight am arrival <eos> hands on the bible when he turned but whos counting <eos> he couldnt find anyone who wanted to party <eos> so he walked around a playground with a bag of mickeys tallboys <eos> and he heard the sound of laughter and he followed it for fifteen blocks <eos> there was a house between mavis and water <eos> they were out on the porch they were inside playing quarters <eos> and he said "dont you know the game kazaam its a better game <eos> you point your elbow at someone and say somebody elses name <eos> and it alternates whose turn it is and if you lose you drink" <eos> they said "man you really make us think <eos> yeah you make us think and so <eos> tonight were gonna be the party <eos> we will party all night long <eos> we are the party generation <eos> so have a seat whats in the bag <eos> party on" <eos> round about one or two it started winding down <eos> and he knew what they needed they needed donuts <eos> so they walked out to krispy krullers all night sugar palace <eos> it was there in the doorway he said "oh well maybe not" <eos> inside there were six women talking <eos> they were the most justified angry exgirlfriends <eos> and they swivelled around slowly like they saw something bad <eos> through the eyes in the back of their heads <eos> like he always knew they had <eos> and they said "what a coincidence" and "hey youre just the man <eos> we were saying that you did the best you could <eos> youre fine we understand and so <eos> tonight were gonna be the party <eos> we will party all night long <eos> we are the party generation <eos> you were the best but well survive <eos> party on" <eos> in the morning they sent him home with a designated driver <eos> and he lay down and thought about the whole night <eos> and he looked up at the photo that he bought at a junk shop <eos> it was only fifty cents but he framed it and everything <eos> it was the kind of party that you hope never ends <eos> the lucky party boy surrounded by his friends <eos> and they were all in pointed hats <eos> caught in a rebel birthday shout <eos> and he was at the candles with his mom there to help him out <eos> there was a lot that you could learn if you lay near them <eos> like if you listened you could hear them and he could hear them <eos> they say <eos> tonight were gonna be the party <eos> we will party all night long <eos> we are the party generation <eos> so lift your head and blow em out <eos> tonight were gonna be the party <eos> we will party all night long <eos> we are the party generation <eos> so lift your head lift your head <eos> party on well the mountain was so beautiful <eos> that this guy built a mall and a pizza shack <eos> yeah he built an ugly city because <eos> he wanted the mountain to love him back <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> when you know that you wont get your heart in that stone <eos> when you drop your tools and you stand alone <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> well when my love felt like another addiction <eos> i held my breath and i packed my bags <eos> and i went to the land of the monastery <eos> and the sunshine children and the prayer flags <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> when you feel your soul go beyond your skin <eos> when you know thats the way that its always been <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> well i climbed a mountain and i thought about attachment <eos> and i thought about the buddhist king <eos> he said "you can keep your superpower <eos> it just short circuits my country" <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> when you question what your desire is for <eos> when you dont just figure that you just want more <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> well i love the way the world is your garden <eos> and you plant your seeds and you let them grow <eos> and you take things out of the ground just like <eos> you take what comes but you never know <eos> yeah and the mountain is so beautiful <eos> and we dont know if were any good at all <eos> and we give our love when we think we still need it <eos> yeah we give and give and fall and fall <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> when the giving is all that you ever get back <eos> oh how long do you love like that <eos> can you tell me oh how to love <eos> hey what do you love more than love <eos> hey what do you love more than love step through this trampled wall <eos> the unhinged door betrays it all <eos> that far within our faith we were all waiting <eos> the broken glass reflects the haze <eos> it shines like endless holy days <eos> struggling to remember what theyre celebrating <eos> well a god descended <eos> and the reason ended <eos> his life was lifted just above the law <eos> and now we have to live with what we did <eos> with what we saw <eos> well you mend your clothes and patch your roof <eos> and slivers of gods shattered truth <eos> grow tender as the grass in cleanswept yards <eos> but a savior came and told us how <eos> the truth was all around us now <eos> abandon house and field and gather up the shards <eos> well a god descended <eos> and the reason ended <eos> his life was lifted just above the law <eos> and now we have to live with what we did <eos> with what we saw <eos> well you build your faith with strength and duty <eos> build your love but theres a beauty <eos> well you know the scriptures tell <eos> there are a few shards left in hell <eos> and if we want a god we had to follow follow him down <eos> pictures torn out of their frames <eos> and orgies where we lost our names <eos> all were gone with times real desire <eos> well you ask how god can curse you thus <eos> thats not a question asked by us <eos> we burned our beds and books <eos> we fear weve lost the fire <eos> the god descended <eos> and the reason ended <eos> his life was lifted just above the law <eos> and now we have to live with what we did <eos> with what we saw if youre gonna get your heart broke you better do it just right <eos> its gotta be raining and you gotta move your stuff that night <eos> and the only friend you can reach isnt a good friend at all <eos> and you know when he says "now who dumped who" that you never should have made that call <eos> i had the blessings theres nobody there theres nobody home <eos> yeah the blessings at the moment i was most alone <eos> and aimless as a fulltime fool the joke was on me <eos> i got all those birds flying off of that tree and thats a blessing <eos> and the blessings were like poets that we never find time to know <eos> but when time stopped i found the place where the poets go <eos> and they said "here have some coffee its straight black and very old" <eos> and they gave me sticks and rocks and stars and all that i could hold <eos> i had the blessings a moment of peace even when the night ends <eos> yeah the blessings can we meet can we meet again <eos> at the crossroads of disaster and the imperfect smile <eos> with the angel in the streetlamp that blinks on as i walk on a mile the blessings <eos> and the best ones were the ones i got to keep as i grew strong <eos> and the days that opened up until my whole life could belong <eos> and now im getting the answers when i dont need them anymore <eos> im finding the pictures and i finally know what i kept them for <eos> i remember i can see them see them smiling see them stuck <eos> see them try i wish them luck and all the blessings <eos> i was fast asleep at three in the morning when i got the payphone call <eos> and she said "did i wake you up" i said "hey no not at all" <eos> and she said "i got this suitcase and i dont know what to pack" <eos> and i said "you can take anything you want just wait and see <eos> its not a release not a reward its the blessings <eos> its the gift of what you notice more" <eos> and i walked out and i watched her kick the big pile of the night <eos> and we sat down and we waited for that strange and empty light <eos> yeah the blessings <eos> see them smiling see them stuck <eos> see them try i wish them luck and all the blessings i am the captain and i have been told <eos> that tomorrow we land and my ship has been sold <eos> now losing this boat is worth scarce a mention <eos> i think of the crew most of all the first ensign <eos> for all we learned the sea <eos> guiding a ship it takes more than your skill <eos> its the compass inside its the strength of your will <eos> the first ensign watched as tempests all tried me <eos> i sang in the wind as if god were beside me <eos> for all we learned the sea <eos> you take the wheel one more time like i showed you <eos> weve reached the strait once even i could not go through <eos> i am the captain and i have been told <eos> but i am not shaken i am eight years old <eos> and you are still young but youll understand <eos> that the stars of the sea are the same for the land <eos> and we came to learn the sea the first part of every day for me is good <eos> ive got the bus stop in my neighborhood <eos> and everythings on purpose everywhere they go <eos> hiding in my car and running in the snow <eos> running with the friends theyll know for years <eos> ive seen it all from here from here <eos> it happens every day before they go to school <eos> they play until the bus drives up beside my lawn <eos> and theres always been a mother who waits til they are gone <eos> then she turns away <eos> it happens every day <eos> noon comes and turns this campus upside down <eos> i watch the students in this college town <eos> you would think theyre carefree i have seen their trials <eos> frowning into shakespeare and practicing their smiles <eos> even underlining nabokov <eos> when i am not in love in love <eos> it happens every day with their journals in cafes <eos> looking up at their reflection on the other wall <eos> with every new idea wondering if theyve changed at all <eos> and then they look away <eos> it happens every day <eos> well life is as hard and as easy as they say <eos> walking the steps weve chosen on this day <eos> some will be outrageous some have rarely shown <eos> some will walk in couples some will walk alone <eos> as i think about the world i see <eos> they stare and smile at me at me <eos> it happens every day at the crossing of the street <eos> walking out to see whats new and what is just the same <eos> and the only word for love is everybodys name <eos> and that will always stay <eos> it happens every day <eos> and every day will happen without you go ahead push your luck <eos> find out how much love the world can hold <eos> once upon a time i had control and reined my soul in tight <eos> well the whole truth <eos> is like the story of a wave unfurled <eos> but i held the evil of the world <eos> so i stopped the tide <eos> froze it up from inside <eos> and it felt like <eos> a winter machine that you go through and then <eos> you catch your breath and winter starts again <eos> and everyone else is spring bound <eos> but when i chose to live <eos> there was no joy its just a line i crossed <eos> it wasnt worth the pain my death would cost <eos> so i was not lost or found <eos> and if i was to sleep <eos> i knew my family had more truth to tell <eos> and so i traveled down a whispering well <eos> to know myself through them <eos> growing up my mom had a room full of books <eos> and hid away in there <eos> her father raging down a spiral stair <eos> till he found someone most days his son <eos> and sometimes i think my father too is a refugee <eos> i know they tried to keep their pain from me <eos> they could not see what it was for <eos> but now im sleeping fine <eos> sometimes the truth is like a second chance <eos> i am the daughter of a great romance <eos> and they are the children of the war <eos> well the sun rose <eos> with so many colors it nearly broke my heart <eos> it worked me over like a work of art <eos> and i was apart of all that <eos> so go ahead push your luck <eos> say what it is you gotta say to me <eos> we will push on into that mystery <eos> and it will push right back <eos> and there are worse things than that <eos> cause for every price and every penance that i could think of <eos> its better to have fallen in love <eos> than never to have fallen at all <eos> cause when you live in a world <eos> well it gets in to who you thought youd be <eos> and now i laugh at how the world changed me <eos> i think life chose me <eos> after all can you fix this its a broken heart <eos> it was fine but it just fell apart <eos> it was mine but now i give it to you <eos> cause you can fix it you know what to do <eos> let your love cover me <eos> like a pair of angel wings <eos> you are my family <eos> you are my family <eos> we stood outside in the summer rain <eos> different people with a common pain <eos> a simple box in that hard red clay <eos> where we left him to always remain <eos> let your love cover me <eos> like a pair of angel wings <eos> you are my family <eos> you are my family <eos> the child who played with the moon and stars <eos> waves a snatch of hay in a common barn <eos> in the lonely house of adams fall <eos> lies a child its just a child thats all crying <eos> let your love cover me <eos> like a pair of angel wings <eos> you are my family <eos> you are my family once upon a time there was a nuclear family <eos> and we lived in a family time <eos> and wed unite in a family way <eos> and off in the ancient mountain <eos> they were splitting every nucleus <eos> they said "dont be alarmed <eos> just dont try this at home" <eos> and they were the mystery that made the world run <eos> and we had the power cause they were the sun <eos> and we called them our heroes and the future had come <eos> they said "look at the light were giving you <eos> and the darkness were saving you from" <eos> soon they were bringing it into our showroom <eos> and theyd unveil it with its title <eos> bring your family bring your family <eos> its the great unknown <eos> you can look but you cant fathom <eos> its the great unknown <eos> im no ordinary princess <eos> i was born in the cold war <eos> and my team is the rockets <eos> go team its a dangerous time <eos> and i dream of the moon and building lunar clone colonies <eos> and i build my peace with strength <eos> thats the best weapon youve got <eos> oh i am the brainchild i am the mortar <eos> with a plastic trophy and an eating disorder <eos> and vision as big as a great big wall <eos> and they tell me that ill move forward <eos> for the good of us all <eos> and the good of nuclear families all <eos> and they think i think i am important <eos> i know i never was no i wasnt <eos> no i never and how could i be <eos> its the great unknown <eos> now weve built it now its ticking <eos> its the great unknown <eos> and i am your children i am millions <eos> and i wanted to sell out i wanted to try <eos> but the sky got too low <eos> and the ocean got too high <eos> and i tried to take god into my own hands <eos> am i too late is it over <eos> have i sacrificed my family to the great unknown <eos> theres a war between my conscience and the great unknown <eos> so i walked out into the gamma fields <eos> out in mercury nevada <eos> where i stood in circle <eos> and that circle started to pray <eos> and the wind at the nuclear test sites <eos> floats the data of the radiation <eos> from the underground testing <eos> cross the line youll get arrested <eos> and we came from all over in a silent appeal <eos> as the drill comes down like a presidential seal <eos> and we stand for the living and we stand for the dead <eos> and we looked out to see your enemies <eos> and we see that youre looking all at us instead <eos> and you think i am being disruptive <eos> but no im running home im running <eos> cause im trying to put the atom back together <eos> its the great unknown <eos> im just trying to put the atom back together <eos> its the great unknown i heard love can fall so hard it can bury a kingdom <eos> i heard it makes the spring appear out of season <eos> its a storm in a shadowbox a force to be reckoned with <eos> when it finds you and find you it will <eos> and id never believe it til i loved i love <eos> the rivers sing and stars awaken above me <eos> and the wind and the moon in fits of restless conspiring <eos> turn night to heaven for you <eos> but i am going to a far far land <eos> i know it sure as ive a past and a future <eos> with my maps on the table you see i have lost many things <eos> so many i wont turn back <eos> and were i a deadwood ship my heart a compass <eos> i would leave with inanimate grace no love could touch me <eos> but i live and i know that ill burn as i grow <eos> though it may break my heart to walk away ron and nancy got the house but sid and nancy rule <eos> i died eight years ago im still a legend at my high school <eos> i stole a chevy and i wrapped it round a tree <eos> but thats ok cause no ones gonna make the next century <eos> im up in heaven now they say im here to stay <eos> where the clouds are really puffy and the angels sing every day <eos> alleluia <eos> the cafeterias got everything its gonna drive me mad <eos> cause it looks just like a big hawaiian party that my mother had <eos> its like the worst elvis film ive ever seen <eos> technicolor luau all on technicolor green <eos> theres camping trips and donkey rides and singing round the fire <eos> and they signed me up for surfing <eos> but they cant get me in the choir <eos> alleluia <eos> but there she was this morning getting fitted for her wings <eos> leather boots magenta hair and saying nasty things <eos> id say she was an angel but its stupid and its obvious <eos> i said youll hate it here cause were the only ones like us <eos> its cryptofascist mania its silicon deliria <eos> yeah she said youre right but i like the cafeteria <eos> alleluia <eos> hey god were the bad kids were so nasty mean and vile <eos> god looks like a guidance counselor gods got that smile <eos> god says how could this be thats really odd <eos> i guess ill have to check my records silly me you know im only god <eos> alleluia theres a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake <eos> yeah its out there on the cutting edge the people move the sidewalks shake <eos> and theres another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds <eos> where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with freestanding tubs <eos> theyre in houses that are haunted the with kids who lie awake and think about <eos> all the generations past who used to use that dripping sink <eos> and sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see <eos> what its like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of mrs ogilvey <eos> she used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the sunday pork <eos> sometimes southern california wants to be western new york <eos> it wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools <eos> it wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel <eos> and it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids <eos> and it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids <eos> and its embarrassed but its lusting after a suny student with mousy brown hair who is <eos> taking out the compost making coffee in long underwear <eos> and southern california says to save a place ill meet you there <eos> and it tried to pack up its miata all it could fit was a prayer <eos> sometimes the stakes are bogus sometimes the fast lane hits a fork <eos> sometimes southern california wants to be western new york <eos> tempe arizona thinks the everglades are greener and wetter <eos> and washington dc thinks that atlanta integrated better <eos> but i think that southern california has more pain that we can say <eos> cause it wants to travel back in time but it just cant leave la <eos> but now i hear theyve got a theme park planned designed to make you gasp and say <eos> oh i bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day <eos> and the old investors scoff at this but the young ones hope theyll take a chance <eos> and they promise it will make more dough than mickey mouse in northern france <eos> and the planners planned an opening day a town historian will host <eos> and the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast <eos> and theyll have puttering on rainy weekends autumn days that make you feel sad <eos> theyll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had <eos> and a hudson river cleanup concert and a bundlebearing stork <eos> and i hear theyve got a menu planned its trã©s western new york my dads a miracle and sos my mom <eos> they fly over the blue <eos> they finish their dinner and then they take one anothers hand <eos> and off they go to find a broader point of view <eos> for its a give and take beyond the ordinary <eos> what with all the cats and kids that theyve loved <eos> and they will not be alone <eos> my friends give me purple flowers and orange tea <eos> on goosedown spilling quilts and turquoise chairs <eos> we greet each other in a wild profusion of words <eos> and wave farewell amidst the wonderment of air <eos> and in the laughing times we know that we are lucky <eos> and in the quiet times we know that we are blessed <eos> and we will not be alone <eos> well the light that stopped the night felt like forgiveness to you <eos> as the garbage trucks came bustling through their rounds <eos> you stared at the pictures on your wall and all the postcards from your friends <eos> as you heard the birds and old familiar sounds <eos> an thats when you knew this world cant be saved only discovered <eos> and you knew things could be different than before <eos> and you will not be alone anymore she never should have rented this apartment in the mortal city <eos> the cold comes though every crack she puts her hand up to <eos> the radiators broken so she has to use electric heat <eos> and tonight was the first date with the brother of the guy she worked next to <eos> he lived a couple streets away <eos> he listened he had things to say <eos> she asked him up for dinner sometime <eos> sometime was tonight <eos> the radio gave updates on the ice storm while she made the dinner <eos> they said from all the talk you shouldnt drive or even walk <eos> and this just in were asking everyone to turn off their power <eos> they need it at the hospital <eos> she ran around pulling plugs then she called him up <eos> maybe now they shouldnt meet he said that he would brave the streets <eos> she met him at the door with a blanket and a candle <eos> saying i heard it on the radio i had to turn my power off <eos> he said youre not the only one the streets were dark tonight <eos> it was like another century <eos> with dim lamps and candles lighting up the icy trees and the clouds and a covered moon <eos> she said what kind of people make a city <eos> where you cant see the sky and you cant feel the ground <eos> i tell you something i have this feeling that this citys dying <eos> he said its not dying its the people who are dying <eos> she said yes yes i think the people are dying and nobody cares <eos> we had all this technology our dreams were bold and vague <eos> and then one city got bad planners one city got the plague <eos> he asked why did you move here she said for the job <eos> for the job and ive been so lonely here so lonely <eos> theres no one i can talk to you know i dont even know your brother <eos> he smiled and said sometimes at night i walk out by the river <eos> the citys one big town the water turns it upside down <eos> people found this city because they love other people <eos> they want their secretaries they want their power lunches <eos> and think about tonight i heard the same newscast you did <eos> i unplugged everything i looked out the window <eos> and i think the city heard i watched as one by one the lights went off <eos> so they could give their power to the hospital <eos> they ate in silence while she thought this over <eos> they sat together in a dark room in the mortal city <eos> shifting in their blankets so they wouldnt get spaghetti on them <eos> then came the awkward moment after dinner what to do <eos> the ice was still falling the streets were still dangerous <eos> the cabs were not running and this neighborhood was not the greatest <eos> they both looked at the space where a couch wouldve been <eos> she felt her stomach sink she felt like she could hardly think <eos> she said i never should have rented this apartment in the mortal city <eos> the cold comes through eve crack i put my hand up to <eos> the radiator doesnt work i have to use electric heat <eos> that settled it they would both sleep in her bed <eos> it was a matter of survival <eos> she brought out tshirts sweatshirts sweatpants socks hats <eos> if there was ever any thought of what would happen in that bed tonight <eos> there was no question now <eos> they could barely move <eos> they were wrapped up like ornaments waiting for another season <eos> they lay in bed they listened to the pelting ice <eos> he said my brothers not a bad guy hes just quiet <eos> i wished you liked this city <eos> she said maybe i do <eos> i think i have a special kind of hearing tonight <eos> i hear the neighbors upstairs <eos> i hear my heart beating <eos> i hear one thousand hearts beating at the hospital <eos> and one thousand hearts by their bedsides waiting <eos> saying thats my love in the white gown <eos> we are not lost in the mortal city <eos> we are not lost in the mortal city you gotta admit life magazine made look great <eos> my father said it sucked everybody died <eos> all the troops you couldnt save no one knew how to be brave <eos> he said sometimes you were afraid to turn your radio on <eos> it was enough to make you quit that peacenick scene <eos> well i heard about leaders yeah i hear theyre no longer around <eos> cause peace was abandoned and bravery hanged in his town <eos> and they passed down a sentence <eos> for building on the beauty of some dream <eos> all my heroes are dead i got them in my head saying <eos> never again never a war no more fighting <eos> so ill stay true to them and theyll come home again <eos> ill carry the light follow the dream ill remember <eos> the convention was a singing the times they are achanging <eos> well i guess they achanged back <eos> oh i miss those peaceful folk love and humor when they spoke hey <eos> phil ochs you still sound great shouldve stuck around to hear it <eos> they say that compact disc makes songs come true <eos> but phil i never expected that id miss you like a friend <eos> cause i never expected that we would be marching again <eos> and the soldiers of peace would tumble from this life as in a war <eos> all my heroes are dead and all the books i read <eos> said "this is greed this is wrong fight your war at home" <eos> so ill stay true to them and theyll come home again <eos> ill carry the light follow the dream ill remember <eos> so back to the present passion romance love or simply put a lack thereof <eos> shall we go on <eos> i dont take it personally its our postmodern history <eos> you know since nixon was impeached its just been hard to commit <eos> so we cast our allegance left and right <eos> but i always believed that our souls would come through <eos> so i never expected that youd take her home with you <eos> and i never detected how hardened and not sorry you could be <eos> dont you know <eos> all our heroes are dead we got ourselves instead <eos> and oh my friend all your lies they wont do you <eos> you gotta stay true to them and theyll come home again <eos> i miss them too i miss them too you know i miss them <eos> more than i love you come lovers come loners remember yourselves <eos> as lusty tempestuous fools <eos> when your dream was to conquer an ocean <eos> from your small secretarial pools <eos> when you stood at the gulf of unknowing <eos> when you saw the great tundra of time <eos> and you cried for the winds to come blowing <eos> and you called a monsoon from the tides of the moon <eos> cause the roads were all dusty and dry <eos> come lame dancing lonely tonight <eos> when what should appear in the distance <eos> blown hither and yon its calamity john <eos> and hes coming to sweep you awayaye i aye ayy <eos> hell tear through the homefront hell lift you up laughing <eos> hell blow every signpost away <eos> as the weather report says high drama <eos> with a five percent chance that hell stay <eos> now the floor starts to rock and the roof floats <eos> and your friends say hes bad for your health <eos> and theyve warmed you about him on talk shows <eos> so you told him to pack hit the road dont come back <eos> and he says hey "dont flatter yourself" and you say <eos> i am closing my door to the storm <eos> i am saving myself from its freedom <eos> i have put the chain on oh calamity john <eos> i dont want you to dance me awayaye i aye ayy <eos> so its seven months later youve bolted your hair back <eos> youre almost immune to the moon <eos> and at parties you stay in the kitchen <eos> common sense with a big wooden spoon <eos> all at once you can feel the storm coming <eos> as you burst out into the old refrain <eos> to the sound of america drumming <eos> call it pain call it art call it open your heart <eos> let it go let it fly let it rainoh yeah <eos> he smiles and the clouds turn to black <eos> with the wind through the flowers come blowing <eos> the warning bells on "whats your name oh its john" <eos> thats such an unusual nameaye i aye ayy i am thinking about the woman in a century of peace <eos> on a bright mosaic she is washing on her knees <eos> and she looks up at the black sky beyond the mountain tall <eos> she says "oh good the rain is finally going to fall today" <eos> this was pompeii <eos> and everyone has memories of the night that melted stone <eos> the neighbors nightgown the screaming on the phone <eos> and the tired man at the station says "we cant tell whos alive <eos> all we ever know is that the tourists survive" <eos> "tra la tra la" they say they say <eos> "lets go pompeii" <eos> i think about pompeii when i feel an end is near <eos> just before the rain and every time you disappear <eos> and i think about a teacup suspended and halfserved <eos> and all the scholars know is that its perfectly preserved <eos> thats all they say <eos> this was pompeii <eos> and as for my own kingdom not a table leg was charred <eos> i simple lost my kingdom cause i held it much too hard <eos> once i had a sadness the sadness turned to trust <eos> the trust turned into ashes and to lawyers and dust <eos> a century a day <eos> this was pompeii the blue it speaks so full <eos> its like the beauty one can barely stand <eos> or too much things dropped in your hand <eos> and theres a green like the peace in your heart sometimes <eos> painted underneath the sheets of ashy snow <eos> and theres a blue like where the urban angels go very bright <eos> now the calder mobile tips a biomorphic sphere <eos> then it swings its dangling pieces round to other paintings here <eos> your behavior is so male <eos> its like you cant explain yourself to me <eos> i think ill ask renoir to tea <eos> for his flowers are as real as they are all the time <eos> and the sunlight sets the furniture aglow <eos> its a pleasant time as far as people go how far do they go <eos> well his roses are perfect and his words have no wings <eos> i know what he can give me and i like to know these things <eos> i met her at the funeral <eos> she said "i dont know what he meant to me <eos> i just know he affected me <eos> an effect not unlike his art i believe" <eos> the service starts and we are in the know <eos> he had so much to say but more to show and aint that true of life <eos> so we weep for a person who lived at great cost <eos> yet we barely knew his powers til we sensed that we had lost <eos> a friend and i in a museum room <eos> she says "look at mark rothkos side <eos> did you know about his suicide" <eos> some folks were born with a foot in the grave but not me of course <eos> and she smiles as if to say were in the know <eos> then she names a coffee place where we can go uptown <eos> now the painting is desperate but the crowds wash away <eos> in a world of kind pedestrians whove seen enough today words and music by dar williams <eos> have i got everything am i ready to go <eos> is it going to be wild is it gonna be the best time <eos> or am i just asaying soooo am i ready to go <eos> what do i hear when i say i hear the call of the road <eos> i think it started with driving more speed more deals more <eos> sky more wheels <eos> more things to leave behind now its all in a day for the <eos> modern mind <eos> and i am traveling again <eos> calling this a ghost town and where is the heartland <eos> and im afraid oh was there any good reason that i had to go <eos> when all i know is i can never come back <eos> traveling i made a friend he had a trouble in his head <eos> and all he could says that he knew that the bottle <eos> drank the woman from his bed from his bed <eos> he said "im not gonna lose that way again" <eos> but sober is just like driving more joy more dread someone <eos> turns her head <eos> and smiles and disappears <eos> hes gotta take it like it is and it goes too fast <eos> and he is just like me caught inbetween no sage advisor <eos> does weary mean wiser <eos> and someday will i sing the mountains that carried me away away <eos> from home and hometown boys like you <eos> yeah but what about us was it really that bad <eos> oh its hard to believe i want a highway roadstop <eos> more than all the times we had on little dirt roads <eos> what am i reaching for thats better than a hand to hold <eos> it really was about driving not fame not wealth <eos> not driving away from myself <eos> its just myself drove away from me <eos> and now i gotta get it back and it goes so fast so i am traveling <eos> again <eos> sitting at the allnight picking up a pen <eos> and im afraid oh was there any good reason <eos> that i had to go when all i know is i am all alone again <eos> and you are the ghost town and i am the heartland <eos> and i can say oh thats a very good reason <eos> that i had to go but now all i know is i can never come back <eos> and i will never go back get off your catwalk i want you to talk <eos> to be the seer instead of the seen <eos> there is a flower a leaning tower <eos> and all of the wonders standing between <eos> i dont want to be another mystery oh no <eos> i dont want to see whos looking at me oh no <eos> i want to be the one to feel the sun oh oh <eos> so if you want to see the world with me lets go <eos> the alligator the god that made her <eos> and all the creatures that got left behind <eos> in mycenaea ave maria <eos> and everything you gotta dig harder

<eos> im stopping traffic cinemagraphic <eos> with my long black coat hanging down in the dirt <eos> and my hair clinging to my face in the rain <eos> like a goddess from the cult of beautiful pain <eos> i dont want to be another mystery <eos> i dont want to be another mystery <eos> i could cut you off with a shoulder of stone <eos> smoke all night and leave the party alone <eos> screw myself

the firmament <eos> in the rain in the rain people rush around on cold streets <eos> heres a shell to hear their heartbeats very loud very loud <eos> wheres the pain its only rain its only slowing down a work day <eos> only singing happy birthday to a crowd very loud <eos> so turn on the sky let it hear what youre saying <eos> for all that you are saying <eos> and let it take you apart to the elements of praying <eos> till we are only playing to the firmament <eos> till we are only playing to the firmament <eos> and when did sex get so mean when did crime get so clean <eos> you know i just cant seem to find the soul in this striving <eos> why not play to a dream cause the world is too green <eos> for all this bad driving <eos> whats the rush dip your brush into this twilight <eos> there

always the sky let it hear what youre saying <eos> for all that you are saying <eos> let it take you apart to the elements of praying <eos> till we are only playing to the firmament <eos> till we are only playing to the firmament are we the fools for being surprised <eos> that a silence could end with no sound <eos> like the silent movie era like with snow <eos> like when sals burned down <eos> well yeah there was noise but nothing to mark the passing on <eos> of that great unspoken chance we had found <eos> where the nights end came welltrod and familiar <eos> like the charlie chaplin walk that fades to black <eos> and there wasnt anyone trying to sell their souls <eos> they were only trying to buy them back <eos> they were only trying to buy them back <eos> well yeah there was a sal <eos> he walked with bulging pockets round town <eos> either he was up to no good <eos> or he just got excited watching things burn down <eos> well i guess he got the idea if you hold a chunk of gold in your hand now <eos> for once in your life you can throw some weight around <eos> and sal your slimeball sellout how can we blame you <eos> we all want something to put our fingers on <eos> and youll never know the true throne that youve lost <eos> till the vinyl barstools are gone <eos> till the vinyl barstools are gone <eos> if you toss around some words you might say that <eos> sal was carrying a torch for the mob <eos> but the mobs gone too yeah the only sign of them left <eos> is on every screen at the multiplex and we go there no prob hey <eos> cause there aint no cowboys in this connecticut town <eos> no not anymore no not since sals burned down <eos> once you dip your tin cup down in the muses watering hole <eos> or pioneer a new patch of common ground <eos> then youd lie on your timetraveled bedroll <eos> quite amazed at the expansive terrain <eos> and if anyone said youd never have fame and fortune <eos> just that bar you know youd ride that way again <eos> i bet youd ride that way again when i grew up well it felt great <eos> i watched how others took their fate <eos> some felt afraid and undefended so they got mean <eos> and they pretended what they knew made them belong more than you <eos> im sure you know theres lots to learn <eos> but thats not your fault thats just your turn yeah yeah <eos> teenagers kick our butts tell us what the future will bring <eos> teenagers look at us we have not solved everything <eos> we drink and smoke to numb our pain <eos> we read junk novels on the plane <eos> we use authority for show so we can be a little smarter <eos> we still can grow and many do <eos> its when we stop we cant reach you <eos> we feel the loss you feel the blame <eos> were scared to lose dont be the same hey hey <eos> teenagers kick our butts tell us what the future will bring <eos> teenagers look at us we have not solved everything <eos> the hometown brought its hero in <eos> to speak at the high school gym <eos> he took a breath he took a chance <eos> he strode up in his leather pants <eos> and said "gee thanks but <eos> im here today because i fought for what i felt and what i thought <eos> they put me down they were just wrong <eos> and now its they who dont belong oh oh <eos> teenagers kick our butts tell us what the future will bring <eos> teenagers look at us we have not solved everything <eos> and when the media tries to act your age <eos> dont be seduced theyre full of rage <eos> find your voice do what it takes <eos> make sure you make lots of mistakes <eos> and find the future that redeems <eos> give us hell give us dreams <eos> and grow and grow and grow <eos> and someday when some teenagers come to kick your butts <eos> well then like i do try to <eos> love <eos> kick our butts <eos> love <eos> kick our butts <eos> oh i love <eos> kick our butts i wonder if yoko ono <eos> ever thought of staying solo <eos> if she thought of other men and <eos> if she doubted john lennon <eos> worrying that hed distract her art <eos> sitting in the apple sessions <eos> giving john her music lessons <eos> challenging the warring nations <eos> with her paper installations <eos> did she guard her yoko human heart <eos> well they could talk about me <eos> yeah they could talk about me <eos> throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history <eos> but i wont be your yoko ono <eos> if youre not good enough for me <eos> some will give their love for fashion <eos> others trade their gold for passion <eos> i dont have the goods to start with <eos> never had the reins to part with <eos> still i hope you take me seriously <eos> cause i think i could go <eos> deep as the sea of yoko <eos> you dont know a person like me <eos> i could sell your songs to nike <eos> and for all you know <eos> i could save your soul <eos> as only true love can change your mind <eos> make you leave your screaming fans behind <eos> when john called the wind an opera <eos> making love with every chakra <eos> when he said her voice would carry <eos> and when he whispered old chuck berry <eos> only then would yoko set him free <eos> fame will come and vanish later <eos> transcendental love is greater <eos> i think if we had this somehow <eos> wed be feeling famous right now <eos> wed be saying love is all you need <eos> and they could rag about me <eos> yeah they could rag about me <eos> throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history <eos> but i wont be your yoko ono <eos> if youre not good enough for me <eos> oh no and i wont be your yoko ono <eos> if youre not good enough for me im not a leader <eos> im not a leftwing rhetoric mobilizing force of one <eos> but there was a time way back <eos> many years ago in college dont laugh <eos> but i thought i was a radical <eos> i ran the hemp liberation group with my boyfriend <eos> it was true love with a common cause <eos> and besides that he was a sagittarius <eos> we used to say that our love was like hemp rope <eos> three times as strong as the rope that you buy domestically <eos> and we would bond in the face of oppression from big business and the deans <eos> but i knew there was a problem <eos> every time the group would meet everyone would light up <eos> that made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights <eos> not to mention chemotherapy <eos> well sometimes life gives us lessons sent in ridiculous packaging <eos> and so i found him in the arms of a student against the treacherous use of fur <eos> and he gave no apology he just turned to me stoned out to the edge of oblivion <eos> he didnt pull up the sheets and i think he even smiled as he said to me <eos> "well i guess our dreams went up in smoke" <eos> and i said no our dreams went up in dreams you stupid pothead <eos> and another thing what kind of a name is <eos> students against the treacherous use of fur <eos> fur is already dead and besides <eos> a name like that doesnt make a good acronym when the robin builds in the holly tree <eos> its a sign of life its gentle victory <eos> well today as i set to go <eos> i saw a nest in a tree hollow <eos> oh emily youre a brave girl <eos> with your husband gone to the other world <eos> sing a hymn while i light the fire <eos> well be joined by a heavenly choir <eos> heres the tansy and the chamomile tea for you to drink <eos> as the pain increases well you only have to think <eos> about a baby well save the baby <eos> i placed a holly sprig by the doctors door <eos> he has done this well and many times before <eos> hell be careful which way he goes <eos> but hes been kind to us farm widows <eos> and this i heard just the other day <eos> that they came to buy and you chose to stay <eos> soon a child will help you reap and sow <eos> may he cast a long shadow <eos> but you say the trials are coming you have felt the gathering forces <eos> and the galloping you hear is of one too many horses <eos> but rest your head my darling girl there wont be any danger <eos> any christian ever loved an infant in a manger <eos> saves the baby theyll save the baby <eos> now the pastor comes shakes the farmers hand <eos> says "the earth will bear like the promised land" <eos> you have heard the stories down below <eos> but god will bless this farm hollow <eos> now the farmers wife shudders pulls the shawl up to her shoulder <eos> every time she nears the hearth she feels a little colder <eos> wheres the baby there was a baby tell me what you see <eos> is it close to what you dreamed <eos> if i play a part <eos> can i be redeemed <eos> we pore through the passages <eos> the leather volume shelves <eos> but they only leave us wondering <eos> can we find ourselves <eos> in the book of love oh <eos> in the book of love <eos> looking for the one <eos> waiting on a day <eos> countless dinner parties <eos> and all the games we play <eos> often sung processional <eos> solemn wedding vow <eos> a picture in a picture frame <eos> that beauty can allow <eos> in the book of love oh <eos> in the book of love <eos> and love becomes a temple <eos> and we begin to feel <eos> then an unfeeling oracle <eos> will say you did come near <eos> but you are not welcome here <eos> this is who i am <eos> all the places that ive been <eos> fondness and regret <eos> every love that ive been in <eos> and ive played all the characters <eos> the fool the friend the wife <eos> and no matter what the ending is <eos> the story of my life <eos> is the book of love oh <eos> is the book of love i walked the spiraling village one night <eos> drawn by the word of a bell or a light <eos> out on the flat side it rolls to a spire <eos> all becomes clear as <eos> the tide falls away <eos> parent and child and an ocean between <eos> one is not heard and the other not seen <eos> too many bottles but each had a message inside <eos> all becomes clear as <eos> the tide falls away <eos> all becomes clear as <eos> the tide falls away <eos> lucky we are when the stars leave us singing a hymn <eos> or a dirge of the ocean is gone <eos> is gone <eos> and the old woman just stares at her hands <eos> so many heroes have crumbled to sand <eos> all those cathedrals were merely by men <eos> it all becomes clear as <eos> the tide falls away <eos> all becomes clear as <eos> the tide falls away <eos> all falls away from the ship we could see it in the distance <eos> as the fog was finally lifting <eos> we had come to the shores of summerday <eos> gently landing we jumped out on the sand and found our way <eos> where the dirt was soft and black <eos> we started digging a garden <eos> and soon we found the woods that wed call <eos> the forest of arden for to play <eos> when we came to summerday <eos> on the shores of summerday <eos> we will live in summerday <eos> and we climbed a stony mountain <eos> we were boisterous then quiet <eos> as we thought about what instruments to make <eos> soon we started to build the uillean pipes and fine guitars <eos> then we scouted out the hollows for solitude and silence <eos> and we found the places we could meet by the blue and glassy river <eos> under stars where the paper lanterns sway <eos> in the streets of summerday <eos> trust the night and trust the day <eos> sun and moon of summerday <eos> we are pilgrims in the land between religions <eos> we are following our children <eos> and we paint in different colors every day <eos> and if were true to our hearts they will grow up and want to stay <eos> we will work beside them as they build modest houses <eos> and on a misty april morning well rest the shovels on the fence <eos> and die and become a summer day <eos> oh the fields of summerday <eos> and the flowers of summerday <eos> they will live in summerday <eos> to the shores of summerday <eos> so we sail to summerday <eos> we will live in summerday its a cold cold time <eos> its a cold cold time <eos> and it makes me wonder <eos> if ill ever forget how cold i how cold i <eos> and the world can be <eos> and the longest draw <eos> and we draw the line <eos> and we say its only the business of things <eos> how can it be how can it be <eos> when its you and me <eos> i cant live in the past <eos> hard shelled and moving fast <eos> change is the race car of time <eos> everyone nods along <eos> i have done nothing wrong <eos> and it feels like a crime <eos> and its a bright new day <eos> its a bright new day <eos> and the crazy thing is <eos> that i wish my old friend <eos> would say that its fine <eos> say ill be fine in a cold cold time rain falls hard <eos> burns dry <eos> a dream <eos> or a song <eos> that hits you so hard <eos> filling you up <eos> and suddenly gone <eos> breathe feel love <eos> give free <eos> know in your soul <eos> like your blood knows the way <eos> from your heart to your brain <eos> know that youre whole <eos> and youre shining <eos> like the brightest star <eos> a transmission <eos> from a midnight radio <eos> and youre spinning <eos> like a <eos> ballerina <eos> dancing to your rock and roll <eos> heres to patti <eos> and tina <eos> and yoko <eos> aretha <eos> and nona <eos> and nico <eos> and me <eos> and all the strange rock and rollers <eos> you know youre doing alright <eos> so hold on to each other <eos> you gotta hold on tonight <eos> and youre shining <eos> like the brightest stars <eos> a transmission <eos> on a midnight radio <eos> and youre spinning <eos> your new s <eos> all the misfits <eos> and the losers <eos> well you know youre rock and rollers <eos> spinning to your rock and roll <eos> lift up your hands i knew a guy <eos> i thought he was my first love <eos> but he had to decide <eos> between me and the one before <eos> and she stacked it all up <eos> like a house of cards <eos> said if he didnt come back <eos> hed find her flattened on the floor <eos> and though i went and lived in my own hell <eos> thought that i could die as well <eos> i let him go where he thought he had to go <eos> chorus <eos> cause i never took <eos> heavy words for granted <eos> and i never took <eos> undeserved advantage <eos> no i never took <eos> the easy way <eos> so why dont you take it a little easy on me now <eos> out on the road <eos> i had so many questions <eos> i thought i would explode <eos> just for some attention <eos> like an acolyte <eos> i saw the flames of towering tapers <eos> almost proselytized by those gleaming piles of paper <eos> yeah i watched the power huddles <eos> and the coats draped over puddles <eos> and trust me baby im the one you need <eos> chorus <eos> cause we all want to be the ones <eos> who lie cheat and slander <eos> so we hold each other up to a higher standard <eos> but ill tell you what <eos> i never try to make it hurt <eos> because when your heart <eos> just to be whole <eos> the only thing thats hard is you <eos> so heres what i took <eos> i kept the wine and laughter <eos> until every pack <eos> it just grew up and ever after <eos> through the peaks and twisty canyons <eos> i made many great companions <eos> best of all is the one who loves me like you do <eos> chorus <eos> cause i never took <eos> heavy words for granted <eos> and its much too late <eos> to even want a shortcut <eos> yeah i never took <eos> the easy way <eos> so you can take it a little easy now <eos> because we know that easy is never easy anyhow rambling and rambling rambling and rambling <eos> its the woods what do you see <eos> in all the spooky shadows in the forest of green <eos> is there a windy path angry ass woman who will eat you <eos> sadeyed lumberjack savior who will greet you <eos> its a different story for you and for me <eos> go to the woods and see <eos> out in the storybook land are many leagues of the wild <eos> wise and uncontainable as a windyhaired child <eos> there are the youth truth movements and theyre springing from the ground <eos> freak flag wavers and you cannot chop them down <eos> hey its the home of the brave youll get the threat of the free <eos> go to the woods and see <eos> are you afraid of the woods <eos> are you afraid of the woods <eos> and if i was your memory what would you do <eos> cause you know if you go back in time theres something waiting for you <eos> youve got your forest path reading math dappling of shade <eos> you can just admit it theres a promise that you made <eos> and you cant have the past back but you can hold me <eos> go to the woods and see <eos> i am afraid of the woods <eos> i am afraid of the woods <eos> but what i fear more what i fear most <eos> more than the man the beast or the ghost <eos> is that the woods are disappearing <eos> so when i go back when i finally dare <eos> you know the woodsll be gone <eos> you know they just wont be there <eos> rambling and rambling rambling and rambling when you think youve found something worth holding on to <eos> were you reaching for attention hoping she would notice you <eos> collecting bottles and thrownaway cans <eos> like she was returnable <eos> one day would refill your hands <eos> how she loved you all you imagined <eos> fit so well into your plans <eos> maybe one day soon <eos> it will all come out <eos> how you dream about each other sometimes <eos> with the memory of <eos> how you once gave up <eos> but you made it through the troubled times <eos> pining away every hour in your room <eos> rolling with the motion waiting til its opportune <eos> sitting there watching time fly past you <eos> why do tomorrow <eos> what you could never do <eos> how she loved you <eos> all you imagined <eos> everything you put her through <eos> maybe one day soon <eos> it will all come out <eos> how you dream about each other sometimes <eos> with the memory of <eos> how you once gave up <eos> but you made it through the troubled times <eos> and it takes a lot of nerve to ask how she is doing <eos> start with a weak foundation you will end in ruins <eos> the ways the days and hours pass youll never understand <eos> falling like rain through your hands <eos> maybe one day soon <eos> it will all come out <eos> how you dream about each other sometimes <eos> with the memory of <eos> how you once gave up <eos> but you made it through the troubled times i know change is a bad thing <eos> breaks me down into a sorry sad thing <eos> not some iridescent grateful butterfly <eos> ill resist with defiance <eos> not the power of a mystic silence <eos> i will fight the dizzy spiral of goodbye <eos> and its alright its alright its alright <eos> its alright its alright its alright <eos> please dont say you dont love me <eos> never dangle any sword above me <eos> with the kind of change that severs me in two <eos> give me amber rising glasses <eos> can you slow it down like molasses <eos> as i salvage my old self away from you <eos> and its alright its alright its alright <eos> its alright its alright its alright <eos> its alright its alright its alright <eos> because i have seen insane things <eos> all those grand historic paintings <eos> morning light on polished swords and burnished pride <eos> ancient smiles encased in whalebone <eos> spines of steel from head to tailbone <eos> cannons poised to blast the turning of the tide <eos> its a sad and a strange thing <eos> but its time and i am changing <eos> into something good or bad well thats your guess <eos> im my own sovereign nation <eos> dedicated to a transformation <eos> marching on with this target on my chest <eos> oh yes its alright its alright its alright <eos> its alright its alright its alright repeat x i went and found a house in the northern woods <eos> and i was doing fine until the night <eos> but then i couldnt take the sun in los angeles <eos> everything was blazing much too bright <eos> i know that i should sit out on a darkened pier <eos> feeling the life that is not lived by chance <eos> and yes i know its just lousy old hollywood <eos> jostling for one more song and dance <eos> but you are everyone you are everyone <eos> i ever trusted that never made a fool out of me <eos> early again today i rushed myself around <eos> i thought that i would miss the morning train <eos> angry that i had lain in my bed too long <eos> watching all the patterns of the rain <eos> so many trips i took to seek somebody out <eos> gaining some ground but maybe losing more <eos> so many pages scrawled to justify myself <eos> i dont know who i did that for <eos> but you are everyone you are everyone <eos> i ever trusted that never made a fool out of me <eos> you took a couple pictures of me once <eos> on some winter night long ago <eos> simply of me you might not call them beautiful <eos> i take them everywhere i go <eos> but you are everyone you are everyone <eos> i ever trusted that never made a fool out of me sitting with a number eight platter at the restaurant

the schoolyard <eos> catching whistles from <eos> the men downtown <eos> no one knows why they went rowin <eos> the three fine daughters <eos> of farmer brown <eos> they didnt know that <eos> the rocks on the river <eos> be the three sisters island <eos> where theyd all drown <eos> widower brown had a girl named nellie <eos> she was the oldest <eos> the toughest of three <eos> she would her

three <eos> with nothing in common <eos> spied upon an abandoned row boat <eos> maybe their sense of adventure had <eos> pushed the three young girls <eos> to set the ship afloat <eos> they didnt know <eos> the strength of the river <eos> the merciless current <eos> that pulled them down <eos> maybe it was the due to the <eos> weight of their denim <eos> but the three girls bodies <eos> were never found <eos> some may recall <eos> the singing of the sirens <eos> lured in the sailors <eos> whod wreck and drown <eos> some say they still hear the fightin and <eos> the flirtin and the preachin

wont forget <eos> celebrations of our death <eos> when every day shes my place to rest <eos> and sometimes i would <eos> and sometimes i could feel blessed <eos> and sometimes i should <eos> and sometimes i could feel less <eos> strange times strange bets <eos> when every wager made holds my soul in debt <eos> kingdoms and queens forget <eos> while we dance our way til life begets everybody thinks well fall apart <eos> everybodys quick to point their fingers at what <eos> they think is causing the problem <eos> and what they dont see is what they wont see my friend <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> just like the holy scripture talks <eos> of a road to redemption in amongst the thorns <eos> the path is beset by ego and greed <eos> and if we dont see then we wont ever be free <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> yes we will <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> and weve all got to learn ourselves <eos> before we can judge some one else <eos> along the path we walk weve only got to find <eos> along the path we walk weve only got to find <eos> along the path we walk weve only got to find <eos> our own heart own mind our own heart own mind <eos> our own heart own mind our own heart own mind this day is getting older <eos> in fading light its beautiful <eos>

meant to <eos> be married someday but life goes away before you notice it leave <eos> now all those places have all gone away <eos> where we used to hang out with our friends and say <eos> "one day were gonna live were gonna live were gonna live gonna live it up" <eos> so close to the surface our hearts beating <eos> was the only sound wed hear deciding <eos> what we were gonna do we were gonna do <eos> we were gonna do to push on through <eos> and if i told you i was worth it would you tell me you wont go <eos> lord knows i try but im not perfect <eos> but i told you so yes i did you know <eos> and if its all show then were already gone <eos> and i know its only been a while but i still miss you <eos> id give anything if itd make me be here with you <eos> see the more that things change the more theyre the same <eos> but therell always be you and me <eos> since all we ever tried to dos been undone <eos> maybe we can maybe someday run away <eos> we could be new we could be new <eos> we could be new girl me and you <eos> or well laugh at stupid things that weve done <eos> never realising what weve become <eos> until its too until its too <eos> until its too late to be true <eos> and if i told you i was worth it would you tell me you wont go <eos> lord knows i try but im not perfect <eos> but i told you so yes i did you know <eos> and if its all show then were already gone the biggest lie i ever told was when i said <eos> "i dont love you no more" <eos> the biggest fake youll ever know <eos> sometimes i feel its everything i dont show <eos> and im always thinking bout relationships <eos> wanna let the rhythm flow and feel the bassline slip <eos> leaving all that fussing and a fighting to them crazy crazy fools <eos> but its time i told you something i think you should know <eos> all about why i ran away and why i let this go <eos> guess i got tired of always feeling like my heart just broke <eos> tired of missing you <eos> and i dont want to fight with you no more <eos> really how many times can we go to war <eos> really how many days do we have to waste <eos> before we can see that weve both made mistakes <eos> and im over always feeling like some hypocrite <eos> telling you things are ok when they dont feel like it <eos> but im not sure that once your heart gets broke the pieces fit <eos> together quite the same <eos> so if you dont mind just for a while <eos> im a keep this mess <eos> that i call a heart cracked and bleeding in this chest <eos> dear god i wish sometimes we had never met <eos> still i love you anyway hey girl i love you <eos> dancing round like that will drive me crazy <eos> but why would i want you <eos> when its plain youre not ever wanting me <eos> well my whole life all i had was this guitar <eos> never gonna be lonely when all i have is music in my heart <eos> never gonna wanna be something i am not <eos> as i get older im a be happy with what i got <eos> cause i got music <eos> and it makes me feel alright <eos> got this here music <eos> and it helps me ease my mind up <eos> cause i got music <eos> and it takes away the pain <eos> got this here music <eos> and i got it every every every day <eos> hey my friends like that <eos> he drives all those little girls crazy <eos> say did you see us <eos> in the background of the crowd on the tv <eos> on a summers day we go and catch some morning waves <eos> hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be ok <eos> just like i dont remember rainy days when i was small <eos> you know i wont remember hatred or nothing at all on a clear day i can see far ahead in front of me <eos> the sky above imagines a god but on another day im <eos> and when i fall the hurt wont show up on me i only hope <eos> and if i follow you along well then ill rise up <eos> chorus <eos> and when the burning sun it falls in my eyes <eos> is when i come upon another sunrise <eos> well i will walk alone cause im not scared to die <eos> on a clearer day in the sunshine <eos> and when i hear the angels sing down from up above <eos> well i wont fear a thing or hear the things ive done <eos> only know that youre in a place inside my heart <eos> and no matter where i go we will never part <eos> chorus <eos> and when the burning sun it falls in my eyes <eos> is when i come upon another sunrise <eos> well i will walk alone cause im not scared to die <eos> on a clearer day in the sunshine going my boats leaving today <eos> gonna get down to the water <eos> gonna wash these blues away <eos> man this citys taken too much from me <eos> gonna head out to the country <eos> find a place where i can breathe <eos> ive been working to <eos> trying to lead a gracious life <eos> but my hard work only ever went to keeping me in strife <eos> gonna take another road <eos> gonna find myself some soul <eos> gonna do my best in every way <eos> to pay attention as i go <eos> cash money <eos> aint got no use for you <eos> unless you can buy me true love <eos> and its funny <eos> how many times theyve proved <eos> that the only true fortune you can save <eos> is the truth <eos> slowly time keeps slipping away <eos> leaves still change their colours <eos> prophets lay still in their graves <eos> erasing all our liberties <eos> gonna take this axe apply it <eos> chop injustice at its knees <eos> the fundamental laws <eos> of suffering and of its cause <eos> man they lay in being human <eos> everybody has their flaws <eos> what if we could overcome <eos> insecurity for love <eos> fear for empathy <eos> education in place of push and shove rolling down the street <eos> diggin the wind in my window <eos> cause today we be high rollin <eos> high rollin baby <eos> life aint what it seems <eos> too many people thinking money is the way to get free <eos> time is golden <eos> time is golden you crazy <eos> yo girl youre so sweet <eos> too busy dancing to the rhythm to be shuffling your feet <eos> hey where you going hey where you going now lady <eos> these walls talk

<eos> the wind blows broken melodies <eos> into the feathers of a blackbird sitting on a branch beside of me <eos> he said you will never know the troubles i have seen son <eos> and you should never go the places i have been <eos> lord dont you try to come with me <eos> lord dont you try to come with me <eos> the superstitious cast their stones at me <eos> let them stare into the blackness <eos> self importance owns the evil it breeds <eos> and as the river flows <eos> the stories that its told go <eos> into the well below <eos> for a blackbird to swallow <eos> lord dont you cry i heard them weep <eos> lord dont you cry i heard them weep so tired of this heavy load <eos> ive been carrying it for so long <eos> i dont know what it wants with me <eos> lord please let me be <eos> rolling dice on my hotel room bed <eos> "man it feels so nice to love some one" she said <eos> "cause when the evening comes im scared to be bad all by myself" <eos> and i know exactly how it feels to be by myself <eos> and now shes singing <eos> "happiness always scared me half to death <eos> never had myself no lovin to caress" <eos> little darling stop those tears and dry those eyes im a be right here <eos> and id really love to stay tonight if youll have me here <eos> oh oh oh oh <eos> little girl you know i love you so <eos> lets take it easy now and simmer down <eos> little girl lets take the long way home guess we came up in a ghost town <eos> now all those buildings have burned down <eos> another price to be paid for being free <eos> its getting harder to see now that the lights have all gone out <eos> cant pay for the electricity <eos> and all along theyve been saying nothing new to me <eos> lately seems right is wrong and wrong is everything we need maybe <eos> and still the beds are burning burning in our sleep <eos> take me away from everything i see <eos> there gunshots on the dancefloor <eos> please tell me what do we die for <eos> and by the way yesterday bet you were me <eos> seen hard days probably see more <eos> theres police at the front door saying <eos> "by the way yesterday heard you were free" <eos> and all along theyve been saying nothing new to me <eos> lately seems right is wrong and wrong is everything we need maybe <eos> and still the beds are burning burning in our sleep <eos> take me away from everything i see <eos> and well dance on the ashes of whats left <eos> as long as these hearts beat in our chests <eos> and we fell through the railings and pavements <eos> while i wondered if they get what i get <eos> and i promise you i wont be leaving <eos> without taking you where i go <eos> see the price of beliefs in believing <eos> anywhere that we go well be share this same old song <eos> and well be standing singing <eos> as if its life were living <eos> as if its blood were spilling <eos> as if were leaving here someday well i woke up last night couldnt tell if i was dreaming <eos> i thought i saw the face of an angel and i heard her speaking to me <eos> she said my boy dont fill up your head with trivial things <eos> cause lifes too beautiful for you to leave <eos> just like periscopes up in the sky <eos> well i have never seen a girl as beautiful as you in my whole life <eos> and things dont always go the way you plan them <eos> but if your rolling with the flow well then it makes it easier <eos> makes it easier to bare <eos> ill give you kisses on your neck just like i always promised <eos> you float into my mind like pictures of an earthly godess <eos> she said my boy dont fill up your heart with nothing but love <eos> that truth is truth to you is truth enough <eos> chorus <eos> easier to bare <eos> chorus x <eos> uh <eos> all i need <eos> i dont need your inhibitions <eos> all ineed is to be free <eos> and i dont like noone to tell me <eos> just where im going because i can see <eos> i can see <eos> show you all of my intentions <eos> get this world belong to me <eos> imitate all my inventions a minute too late

your soul <eos> sea breeze karma philosophies <eos> me and my friends are richer than gold well i was walking back home real late <eos> look at the stars up in the sky <eos> thought of the wishes i had made <eos> then started thinking about all the time we had left <eos> was counting out my mistakes <eos> and counting out my regrets <eos> about you thought about me <eos> thought about all the things wed ever be <eos> thought about you thought about me <eos> thought about all the things wed never be <eos> thought about you <eos> i thought about you <eos> well i woke up in the pouring rain <eos> my pockets empty and a voice runnin round in my brain <eos> it started soundin a lot like the devil himself <eos> sayin noone gets to heaven if they dont go through hell <eos> would you think about me <eos> think about all the things wed ever be <eos> now tell me would you think about me <eos> think about all the things wed never be <eos> so tell me would you <eos> so tell me would you

stones <eos> away from the shore <eos> were not precise anymore <eos> its so unknown <eos> of our device anymore <eos> so over grown <eos> so untold <eos> we always go back to the start <eos> back where we started from <eos> we always wind up at the back <eos> and start all over again <eos> over again over again <eos> were floating as high as weightless stones <eos> away from the end <eos> were floating on by as nameless stones <eos> all over again <eos> were just not concise no more <eos> its all so unknown <eos> of our own device no more <eos> its so overblown just so untold <eos> we always go back to the start <eos> back where we started from <eos> we always wind up at the back <eos> and start all over again <eos> over again over again <eos> we always go back to the start <eos> back where we started from <eos> we always wind up at the back <eos> and start all over again <eos> over again over again how long ill wait for <eos> how long to go to go <eos> how far ill wade for <eos> for waves to so <eos> but in the light day <eos> its not so deep after all <eos> well wait for tides to cary us <eos> home again <eos> its only water <eos> it sings to me <eos> its only water <eos> sent back to sea <eos> but in the light day <eos> its not so deep after all <eos> well wait for tides to cary us <eos> home again calling out to me this time <eos> coming up to see things too
