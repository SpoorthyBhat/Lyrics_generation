thats sweetly playd in tune <eos> as fair art thou my bonie lass <eos> so deep in luve am i <eos> and i will luve thee still my dear <eos> till a the seas gang dry <eos> till a the seas gang dry my dear <eos> and the rocks melt wi the sun <eos> and i will luve thee still my dear <eos> while the sands o life shall run <eos> and faretheeweel my only luve <eos> and faretheeweel a while <eos> and i will come again my luve <eos> tho twere ten thousand mile when i was a miller in fife <eos> losh i thought that the sound o the happer <eos> said tak hame a wee flow to your wife <eos> to help to mak brose to your supper <eos> then my conscience was narrow and pure <eos> but someway by random it rackit <eos> for i lifted twa neivefu or mair <eos> while the happer said tak it man tak it <eos> then hey for the mill and the kiln <eos> the garland and gear for my cogie <eos> and hey for the whisky and gill <eos> that washes the dust frae my craigie <eos> although its been lang in repute <eos> for rogues to mak rich by deceiving <eos> yet i see that it disna weel suit <eos> honest men to begin to the thieving <eos> for my heart it gaed dunt upon dunt <eos> oh i thought ilka dunt it wad crack it <eos> sae i flang frae my neive what was int <eos> still the happer said tak it man tak it <eos> a man thats been bred to the plough <eos> might be deavd wi its clamorous clapper <eos> yet theres few but would suffer the sough <eos> after kenning whats said by the happer <eos> i whiles thought it scoffd me to scorn <eos> saying shame is your conscience no chackit <eos> but when i grew dry from a horn <eos> it changd aye to tak it man tak it <eos> the smugglers whiles cam wi their pocks <eos> cause they kent that i likit a bicker <eos> sae i bartered whiles wi the gowks <eos> gied them grain for a sowp o their liquor <eos> i had lang been accustomed to drink <eos> and aye when i purposed to quat it <eos> that thing wi its clappertie clink <eos> said aye to me tak it man tak it <eos> but the warst thing i did in my life <eos> nae doot but yell think i was wrang ot <eos> od i tauld a bit bodie in fife <eos> a my tale and he made a bit sang ot <eos> i have aye had a voice a my days <eos> but for singin i neer gat the knack ot <eos> yet i try whyles just thinking to please <eos> the greedy wi tak it man tak it <eos> now miller and a as i am <eos> this far i can see through the matter <eos> theres men mair notorious to fame <eos> mair greedy than me o the muter <eos> for twad seem that the hale race o men <eos> or wi safety the hauf we may mak it <eos> hae some speaking happer within <eos> that said to them tak it man tak it ah me i must mourn my true love evermore <eos> though coldly forsaken its you adore <eos> and if youd return then id make you my bride <eos> or id cross the wild atlantic to be by your side <eos> on the morning we parted how sad the farewell <eos> our words they were few but our thoughts none could tell <eos> and when lost to my vision far over the brine <eos> i drank your success in a goblet of wine <eos> three times have i crossed to the ship as she lay <eos> becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay <eos> and my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar <eos> and not by the tempest they laugh at its roar <eos> no ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair <eos> for there none in the dance that with you can compare <eos> and to watch the young lovers as they swing round the floor <eos> brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more <eos> and in beauty theres none with this lady could buy <eos> shes as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky <eos> shes as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose <eos> and theres nothing can tempt me her name to disclose <eos> no drink will i take for to lighten my heart <eos> but the wildest adventures ill take for my part <eos> no women on earth will i have for a bride <eos> til i cross the wild atlantic to be your side <eos> ah me i must mourn my true love evermore <eos> though coldly forsaken its you adore <eos> and if youd return then id make you my bride <eos> or ill cross the wild atlantic to be by your side when oer the hill the eastern star <eos> tells bughtin time is

<eos> and your beauty will haunt me wherever i go <eos> the pale moon above the white sands the pale stars above the thorn trees <eos> are cold beside my darling but no purer than she <eos> i gaze upon the cold moon till the stars drown in the warm sea <eos> but the bright eyes of my darling are never on me <eos> my sunday is weary my sunday it is grey now <eos> my heart is a cold thing my heart is a stone <eos> all joy is dead within me my life has gone away now <eos> for another has taken my love for his own <eos> the day is approaching when we were to be married <eos> and its rather i would die than live only to grieve <eos> oh meet me my darling eer the sun sets oer the barley <eos> and ill meet you there on the road to drumslieve it if wasnt for the ships that do sail that do sail <eos> it if wasnt for the ships that do sail <eos> dublin lady wouldnt have to sit alone upon her stool <eos> it if wasnt for the ships that do sail <eos> if it wasnt for the butter tubs and coal all in the hold <eos> dublin lady wouldnt have to spend her nights alone and cold <eos> if it wasnt for the kegs of beer and cattle in the pen <eos> dublin lady wouldnt miss her sailor laddie now and then <eos> if it wasnt for the irish sea so narrow with no reef <eos> dublin lady wouldnt have to sit and weep all in her grief as i came in by auchindoun <eos> a little wee bit frae the town <eos> when to the highlands i was bound <eos> to view the haughs of cromdale <eos> i met a man in tartan trews <eos> i spiered at him what was the news <eos> quo he "the highland army rues <eos> that ever we came to cromdale" <eos> "we were in bed sir every man <eos> when the english host upon us came <eos> a bloody battle then began <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale" <eos> "the english horse they were so rude <eos> they bathed their hoofs in highland blood <eos> but our brave clans they boldly stood <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale" <eos> "but alas we could no longer stay <eos> for over the hills we came away <eos> and sore we do lament the day <eos> that ever we came to cromdale" <eos> thus the great montrose did say <eos> "can you direct the nearest way <eos> for i will over the hills this day <eos> and view the haughs of cromdale" <eos> "alas niy lord youre not so strong <eos> you scarcely have two thousand men <eos> and theres twentythousand on the plane <eos> stand rank and file on cromdale" <eos> thus the great montrose did say <eos> "i say direct the nearest way <eos> for i will over the hills this day <eos> and see the haughs of cromdale" <eos> they were at dinner every man <eos> when the great montrose upon them came <eos> a second battle then began <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> the grant mackenzie and mky <eos> soon as montrose they did espy <eos> oh then they fought most valiantly <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> the mdonalds they returned again <eos> the camerons did their standard join <eos> mintosh played a bloody game <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> the mgregors fought like lions bold <eos> mphersons none could them control <eos> mlauchlins fought like loyal souls <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> mleans mdougals and mneils <eos> so boldly as they took the field <eos> and made their enemies to yield <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> the gordons boldly did advance <eos> the frasers fought with sword and lance <eos> the grahams they made the heads to dance <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> the loyal stewarts with montrose <eos> so boldly set upon their foes <eos> and brought them down with highland blows <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale <eos> of twenty thousand cromwells men <eos> five hundred fled to aberdeen <eos> the rest of them lie on the plain <eos> upon the haughs of cromdale in the year when our troubles were great <eos> it was treason to be a milesian <eos> and the blackwhiskers said we would never forget <eos> and our history shows they were hessians <eos> and in these troubled times it was a great crime <eos> and martyrdom never was riper <eos> near the town of glenshee not an acre from meath <eos> lived one denny burns the piper <eos> neither weddin nor wake would be worth a shake <eos> if denny was first not invited <eos> for at squeezin the bag or emptyin the keg <eos> he astonished as well as delighted <eos> but in these times denny could not earn a penny <eos> martial law had him stung like a viper <eos> and it kept him within till the bones of his skin <eos> grinned thru the rags of the piper <eos> now one day it did dawn as denny crept home <eos> back from a fair at lethangin <eos> when what should he see from the branch of a tree <eos> but the corpse of a hessian there hangin <eos> says denny "these rogues have got boots ive no brogues" <eos> he took hold of the boots wi a griper <eos> and the boots were so tight and he pulled with such might <eos> legs and all come away with the piper <eos> ah then denny did run for fear of bein hung <eos> til he came to tim haleys cabin <eos> says tim from within "i cant let ye in <eos> yell be shot if youre caught out there rappin" <eos> so he went to the shed where the cow was in bed <eos> he began with a whisp for to wipe her <eos> and they lay down together in seven foot of heather <eos> and the cow took to huggin the piper <eos> well the day it wore on and denny did yawn <eos> and he stripped off the boots from the hessian <eos> and the legs be the law he just left in the straw <eos> and he slipped home with his new possessions <eos> now breakfast bein done tim sent his young son <eos> to get denny up like a lamplighter <eos> and the legs there he saw he flew up like a jackdaw <eos> and said "daddy the cows et the piper" <eos> ah bad luck to that beast shes no musical taste <eos> to eat such a jolly old chanter <eos> a phairaig a mhic take a lump of a stick <eos> drive her off down the road and well canter <eos> well the neighbors were called mrs kennedy bawled <eos> she began for to humbug and jiper <eos> and in sorrow they met and their whistles they wet <eos> and like devils lamented the piper <eos> more <eos> denny the piper cont <eos> and the cow she was drove a mile or two off <eos> and they came to a fair at killaley <eos> and there she was sold for four guineas of gold <eos> to the clerk of the parish john daly <eos> and they went to the tent where the pennies were spent <eos> tim bein a jolly old swiper <eos> and who should be there playin the rakes of killdare <eos> just your bold denny burns the piper <eos> ah then tim give a jolt like a halfdrunken colt <eos> and he stares at the piper like a gamog <eos> i thought by the powers for the last sevral hours <eos> you were playin in the old cows stomach <eos> well when denny observed that the hessians been served <eos> began just to humbug and jiper <eos> oh in grandeur they met and their whistles they wet <eos> and like devils they danced round the piper the moons on the lake and the mists on the brae <eos> and the clan has a name that is nameless by day <eos> our signal for fight that from monarchs we drew <eos> must be heard but by night in our vengeful haloo <eos> then haloo haloo

loneliest hours <eos> now they are gone i shall neer see them more <eos> with wonder i gazed on yon lofty building <eos> as in grandeur i rose from its lord <eos> but soon i beheld my fair garden yielding <eos> the choicest of fruit for his foe <eos> but where is my fathers lone cottage of clay <eos> wherein i ve spent many a long day <eos> alas has his lordship connivd it away <eos> yes it is gone i shall never see it more <eos> when nature was seen in the sloe bush and bramble <eos> all smiling in beautiful bloom <eos> over the fields without danger i often <eos> did ramble amidst their perfume <eos> i have wranged through the woods where the gay featherd <eos> throng <eos> joyfully sung their loud echoing song <eos> these days then of summer passed sweetly along <eos> now theyre gonei shall neer see them more <eos> when the sloe and the berries hung ripe on the bushes <eos> i have gathered them off without harm <eos> i have gone to the field and shorn the green rushes <eos> preparing for winters cold storm <eos> along with my friends telling tales of delight <eos> beguiling the hours of the long winters night <eos> those days gave me pleasurei could them invite <eos> now

<eos> there are men of over ninety <eos> that have never yet kissed a girl <eos> but gie me a ramblin rover <eos> and fae orkney down to dover <eos> we will roam the country over <eos> and together well face the world <eos> theres many that feign enjoyment <eos> from merciless employment <eos> their ambition was this deployment <eos> from the minute they left the school <eos> and they save and scrape and ponder <eos> while the rest go out and squander <eos> see the world and rove and wander <eos> and are happier as a rule <eos> ive roamed through all the nations <eos> taen delight in all creation <eos> and ive tried a wee sensation <eos> where the company did prove kind <eos> and when partin was no pleasure <eos> ive drunk another measure <eos> to the good friends that were treasure <eos> for they always are in our minds <eos> if youre bent wi arthiritis <eos> your bowels have got colitis <eos> youve gallopin with bollockitis <eos> and youre thinkin its time you died <eos> if you been a man of action <eos> though youre lying there in traction <eos> you will get some satisfaction <eos> thinkin "jesus at least i tried" there was a fair young lady so lately ive been told <eos> she lived with her uncle the cause of all her woes <eos> her uncle had a ploughboy which mollie liked quite well <eos> and in her uncles garden their tender love did tell <eos> so early one morning this old man he arose <eos> and at mollies room door he hastened on his clothes <eos> saying " arise you handsome female and married you shall be <eos> for the squire is awaiting on the banks of sweet dundee <eos> "a fig to all your squires to lord and jews likewise <eos> for william pears like diamonds aglittering in my eyes" <eos> "you never shall have willie nor happy shall you be <eos> for i mean to banish willie from the banks of sweet dundee" <eos> the first crowd came on willie when he was all alone <eos> he fought full hard for his liberty but there were eight to one <eos> "pray kill me now" says willie "pray kill me now" says he <eos> "for id rather die for mollie on the banks of sweet dundee" <eos> as mollie was walking lamenting for her love <eos> she meets the wealthy squire all in her uncles grove <eos> "stand off stand off" says mollie "stand off you man" says she <eos> "for id rather die for willie on the banks of sweet dundee" <eos> he threw his arms around her and crushed her to the ground <eos> there she spied two pistols and a sword beneath his morninggown <eos> the pistols she slipped slyly and the sword she used free <eos> she shot and killed the squire on the banks of sweet dundee <eos> her uncle overheard them come hastening to the grove <eos> saying "youve killed the wealthy squire prepare for your deathblow" <eos> "stand off stand off" says mollie "stand off you man says she" <eos> so the trigger drew and her uncle slew on the banks of sweet dundee <eos> the doctor being sent for he knew that they were killed <eos> also there came a lawyer to write the old mans will <eos> he willed his gold to mollie because she fought so free <eos> then closed his eyes to write no more on the banks of sweet dundee there came to the beach a poor exile of erin <eos> the dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill <eos> for his country he sighed when at twilight reparing <eos> to wander alone by the windbeaten hill <eos> but the daystar attracted his eyes sad devotion <eos> for it rose oer his own native isle of the ocean <eos> when once in the fire of his youthful emotion <eos> he sang the loud anthem of eringobragh <eos> "sad is my fate" said the heartbroken stranger <eos> the wilddeer and wolf to a convert can flee <eos> but i have no refuge from famine and danger <eos> a home and a country remain not to me <eos> never again in the green sunny bowers <eos> where my forefathers lived shall i spend the sweet hours <eos> or cover my harp with the wildwomen flower <eos> and strike to the numbers of eringobragh <eos> "erin my country though sad and forsaken <eos> in dreams i revisit thy sea beaten shore <eos> but alas in a far foreign land i awaken <eos> and sigh for the friends who can meet me no more <eos> o cruel fate wilt thou never replace me <eos> in a mansion of peace where no perils can chase me <eos> never again shall my brothers embrace me <eos> they died to defend me or live to deplore <eos> "where is my cabin door fast by the wild wood <eos> sisters and sire did you weep for its fall <eos> where is the mother that looked on my childhood <eos> and where is the bosom friend dearer than all <eos> o my sad heart long abandoned by pleasure <eos> why did it dote on fastfading treasure <eos> tears like the raindrops may fall without measure <eos> but rapture and beauty they cannot recall it being a fine morning this young man he chose <eos> that hed make occasion to wear his fine clothes <eos> and its down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes <eos> to give her a token of his love we suppose <eos> "mary oh mary if i could be your man <eos> between you and danger i fearlessly would stand <eos> with this gold claddagh ring on your lilywhite hand <eos> oh there neer was another would dress you so grand" <eos> theres no sun in summer theres no flowers in spring <eos> her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring <eos> "johnny oh johnny the ring it is of gold <eos> and its hands and fine heart they are lovely to behold <eos> but if i had the ring for one evening to hold <eos> then you shall have my answer eer the week shall be old" <eos> "oh why have the weeks gone and not an answer came <eos> and why is it that women are smarter than men <eos> oh the girls kept the ring which i shall neer see again <eos> oh she has many like it in a fine box at hame" <eos> theres no sun in summer theres no flowers in spring <eos> her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring <eos> it being a fine morning this young man he chose <eos> that hed make occasion to wear his fine clothes <eos> and its down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes <eos> to give her a token of his love we suppose <eos> theres no sun in summer theres no flowers in spring <eos> her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring <eos> oh her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring my darling do not break your heart <eos> though i leave this irish shore <eos> though their cruel laws may force us to part <eos> fate may join we two once more <eos> take this farewell kiss as a token <eos> of my love while far i stray <eos> for true love will never be broken <eos> let me kiss your tears away <eos>

<eos> my girl hath ringlets rich and rare <eos> by natures fingers wove <eos> lochcarras swan is not so fair <eos> as her breast of love <eos> and when she moves in sunday sheen <eos> beyond our cottage door <eos> id scorn the highborn saxon queen <eos> for brighidin ban mo store <eos> it is not that thy smile is sweet <eos> and soft thy voice of song <eos> it is not that thou fleest to meet <eos> my comings lone and long <eos> but that doth rest beneath thy breast <eos> a heart of purest core <eos> whose pulse is known to me alone <eos> my brighidin ban mo store i mourn for the highlands now drear and forsaken <eos> the lands of my fathers the gallant and brave <eos> to make room for the sportsmen their lands were all taken <eos> and they had to seek out new homes far away <eos> oh shame on the tyrants who brought desolation <eos> who banished the brave and put sheep in their place <eos> where once smiled the gardens rank weeds in their station <eos> and deer are preferred to the lealhearted braves <eos> oh where are the parents and bairns yonder rovin <eos> the scene o their gladness is far oer the main <eos> no blithehearted milkmaid now cheers at the gloaming <eos> the herdboy no longer seen on the plain <eos> but the lark is still soaring she sings in her glory <eos> with no one to listen her sweet morning lay <eos> the clansmen are gone but their deeds live in story <eos> like chaff in the wind they were borne far away ae fond kiss and then we sever <eos> ae fareweel alas for ever <eos> deep in heartwrung tears ill pledge thee <eos> warring sighs and groans ill wage thee <eos> who shall say that fortune grieves him <eos> while the star of hope she leaves him <eos> me nae cheerful twinkle lights me <eos> dark despair around benights me <eos> ill neer blame my partial fancy <eos> naething could resist my nancy <eos> but to see her was to love her <eos> love but her and love for ever <eos> had we never lovd sae kindly <eos> had we never lovd sae blindly <eos> never metor never parted <eos> we had neer been brokenhearted <eos> faretheeweel thou first and fairest <eos> faretheeweel thou best and dearest <eos> thine be ilka joy and treasure

face i know <eos> you have taken all thats in me so my heart is in no danger <eos> my heart is in no danger but id still like to know <eos> if there is a silence then it can be broken <eos> if there beats a pure heart to her i will go <eos> and time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger <eos> ah but in the meantime id still like to know have you seen him on the corner <eos> and

her in your arms <eos> and tell her that you love her <eos> if youre going to love a woman <eos> then be sure you do it right" <eos> now he met her at a disco <eos> in a dive in san francisco <eos> and it all might have been different <eos> had he seen her in daylight <eos> she was painted she was scented <eos> but she drove your man demented <eos> if hed gone and asked his father <eos> oh im

but the kirk was still staunin <eos> they biggit a lum whaur the bell used to hang <eos> a stellpat they gat and they brewed hielan whisky <eos> on sundays they drank it and ranted and sang <eos> o had you but seen how graceful it lookit <eos> to see the crammed pews sae socially joined <eos> macdonald the piper stood up in the poopit <eos> he made the pipes skirl out the music divine <eos> wi whiskey and beer theyd curse and theyd swear <eos> theyd argue and fecht what ye daurna weel tell <eos> bout geordie and charlie they bothered fu rarely <eos> wi whisky theyre worse than the devil himsel <eos> when the hairtcheerin spirit had mounted their garret <eos> tae a ball on the green they a did adjourn <eos> the maids wi coats kilted they skippit and liltit <eos> when tired they shook hands and then hame did return <eos> if the kirks a owre scotland held like social meetins <eos> nae warnin yed need from a fartinklin bell <eos> for true love and friends wad draw ye thegither <eos> far better than roarin the horrors o hell there was a lord lived in this town <eos> who had a handsome lovely daughter <eos> she was courted by a fair young man <eos> who was a servant to her father <eos> but when her parents they came to know <eos> they swore theyd send him from the island <eos> the maid she knew her heart would break <eos> had she to part with young matt hyland <eos> then straightway unto her love she goes <eos> into his room him to awaken <eos> saying arise my love and go away <eos> this very night you will be taken <eos> i overheard my parents say <eos> in spite of me he will transport you <eos> so arise my love and go away <eos> i wish to god id gone before you <eos> oh must i go to her he said <eos> oh must i go without my wages <eos> without one penny allin my purse <eos> just like some poor forlorn stranger <eos> heres fifty guineas all in bright gold <eos> and thats far more than father owes you <eos> so take it now and go away <eos> i wish to god id gone before you <eos> they both sat down upon the bed <eos> just for the side of one half hour <eos> not a word did either speak <eos> but down their cheeks the tears did shower <eos> she rests her head upon his breast <eos> and round his neck her arms entwined <eos> not duke nor lord nor earl ill wed <eos> ill wait for thee my own matt hyland <eos> ill wait for thee my own matt hyland <eos> ill wait for thee my own matt hyland my name is patrick sheehan and my years are thirtyfour <eos> tipperary is my native place not far from galtymore <eos> i came of honest parents but now theyre lying low <eos> though manys the pleasant days we spent in the glen of aherlow <eos> my father died i closed his eyes outside the cabin door <eos> for the landlord and the sheriff too were there the day before <eos> and then my lovin mother and my sisters three also <eos> were forced to go with broken hearts from the glen of aherlow <eos> for three long months in search of work i wandered far and near <eos> i then went to the poorhouse to see my mother dear <eos> the news i heard near broke my heart but still in all my woe <eos> i blessed the friends who made their graves in the glen of aherlow <eos> bereft of home and kith and kin with plenty all around <eos> i starved within my cabin and slept upon the ground <eos> but cruel as my lot was i never did hardship know <eos> till i joined the english army far away from aherlow <eos> "rouse up there" cried the corporal "ya lazy irish hound <eos> why dont you hear the bugle its call to arms to sound " <eos> i found i had been dreaming of the days long long ago <eos> and i woke upon sebastopol and not in aherlow <eos> i tried to find my musket how dark i thought the night <eos> o blessed god it wasnt dark it was the broad daylight <eos> and when i found that i was blind my tears began to flow <eos> and i longed for even a paupers grave in the glen of aherlow <eos> a poor neglected mendicant i wander dublins streets <eos> my nine months pension it being out i beg from all i meet <eos> as i joined my countrys tyrants my face i can never show <eos> amongst my dear old neighbors in the glen of aherlow <eos> so irish youths dear countrymen take heed in what i say <eos> for if you join the english ranks youll surely rue the day <eos> and whenever youre tempted asoldiering to go <eos> remember poor blind sheehan from the glen of aherlow let your quacks and newspapers be cutting their capers <eos> about curing the vapors the scratch and the gout <eos> with their medical potions their serums and their lotions <eos> upholding their notions theyre mighty put out <eos> who can tell the true physic to all thats pathetic <eos> and pitch to the divil cramp colic and spleen <eos> youll know it i think if you take a big drink <eos> with your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen <eos> so stick to the cratur the best thing in nature <eos> for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys <eos> oh what botheration no dose in the nation <eos> can give consolation like poteen me boys <eos> no liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic <eos> or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom <eos> as the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers <eos> ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume <eos> and this liquid so rare if you willingly share <eos> to be taking your hair when its frizzled and dead <eos> oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit <eos> so strong it will shake all the hairs from your head <eos> then stick to the cratur the best thing in nature <eos> for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys <eos> oh since its perfection no doctors direction <eos> can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys <eos> while a child in me cradle me nurse with her ladle <eos> was filling my mouth with a notion of pap <eos> when a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle <eos> i stumbled and capered clean out of her lap <eos> on the floor i lay crawlin and screaming and bawling <eos> til me mother and father were called to the fore <eos> all sobbing and sighing they feared i was dying <eos> but soon found i only was crying for more <eos> so stick to the cratur the best thing in nature <eos> for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys <eos> oh lord how theyd chuckle if babes in their truckle <eos> they only could suckle on poteen me boys <eos> through my youthful aggression through times of depression <eos> my childhoods impression still clung to my mind <eos> and at school or at college the basis of knowledge <eos> i never could gulp til with whiskey combined <eos> and as older im growing times ever bestowin <eos> on erins potation a flavor so fine <eos> and how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar <eos> itself is the only true liquid divine <eos> so stick to the cratur the best thing in nature <eos> for sinking your sorrows and raising your joys <eos> oh lord tis the right thing for courting and fighting <eos> theres nowt so exciting as poteen me boys <eos> come guess me this riddle what beats pipes and fiddle <eos> whats hotter than mustard and milder than cream <eos> what best wets your whistle whats clearer than crystal <eos> whats sweeter than

tae watch the fishes glide <eos> and when three months was scarcely oer <eos> the lassie lost her bloom <eos> an the red fell frae her bonnie cheeks <eos> an her eyes began to swoon <eos> noo the neist nine months were past and gone <eos> she brought tae me a son <eos> and i was quickly sent for tae <eos> see what could be done <eos> i said that i would marry her <eos> but oh that widna dae

only makes me feel more alone <eos> grey fog dont you tire <eos> of the dark isolation of night <eos> i know that the pressure gives you life <eos> i know that the truth comes with the quiet <eos> but im just so afraid of mine <eos> so i blame the ones that i love <eos> when i am no one to act as a judge <eos> i know the bottles not best <eos> but im just so starved for some kind of rest <eos> from these lungs <eos> and my tied tongue <eos> what makes a man cave <eos> to the simple escape from his days <eos> is it only a triumph over fear <eos> of what happens when waking disapears <eos> or do we secretly love these tears no answers <eos> no absolutes <eos> all theories <eos> with no kind of proof <eos> clinging on to what we were told <eos> in our youth <eos> i know what they believe i just dont <eos> know why now <eos> with all that weve learned <eos> still no answers <eos> with no stone unturned <eos> i know im never gonna be right <eos> and so i <eos> im filling my belly tonight i read the advice in your letter <eos> to see myself without a filter <eos> so tonight i have locked all my doors <eos> and im down on all fours <eos> wild again <eos> the dawnlight is slowly approaching <eos> eyes open to slow down the spinning <eos> i bet youd be proud of me now <eos> lost in my own house <eos> i cant find a way out <eos> i used to believe <eos> that shame only came on display <eos> to the others <eos> but i was wrong <eos> im here by myself and the feeling is strong <eos> im learning to split into portions <eos> the pain that comes sharp with the morning <eos> i take some with coffee and then <eos> i bring some back to bed <eos> and wait for a dream you shouldnt trust me <eos> i cant decide <eos> whether my instincts <eos> care what is right <eos> if good is inherent <eos> its hard to find <eos> beneath the conceit <eos> in our design <eos> they say were the only <eos> capable of charity <eos> but i would be lying <eos> to make a claim <eos> of any decisions <eos> that arent in vain <eos> when even my giving <eos> could be explained <eos> by the willful feelings <eos> that overtake me in the dark of night <eos> when the last drop of blind youth <eos> has left you <eos> you will wake to find <eos> that you have been lied to <eos> youre nothing more <eos> than cells same as the ones that surround you <eos> and the will to make <eos> and build what there isnt <eos> before you <eos> now will break <eos> this paper and concrete <eos> are nothing new <eos> just earth moved and glued stuck to you <eos> i warned you <eos> theres no use <eos> trying to win shivering <eos> i am looking in at <eos> people that i call my friends <eos> just a sillhouette <eos> with a cigarette <eos> and no idea who i am <eos> there were songs in these eyes <eos> but now theyre gone <eos> if only i had held the light in <eos> flashing teeth <eos> they are smiling <eos> so happy to burn through their time <eos> and i dont know when <eos> but i lost the will to savor mine <eos> now theyre all <eos> stumbling to some other house <eos> though ive tried i cant find any interest now <eos> it takes <eos> the guilt of just a small mistake <eos> to puncture the joy <eos> so its poisoned by doubt <eos> i just wanted to face the expanse <eos> but those dead ends have come to haunt me <eos> i had tried to understand <eos> how i should operate this body <eos> and i was sure but i was wrong <eos> if only i had held the light in <eos> the darkness would be gone a knock on my door <eos> woke me this morning <eos> made by the hand <eos> of a welldressed woman <eos> whod set aside <eos> part of her morning <eos> to ask me if i know why im alive <eos> she walked by a man <eos> who scours the alley <eos> each day for cans <eos> to trade for money <eos> to buy a chance <eos> to play the lottery <eos> and when he doesnt win he starts the cycle again <eos> made to scavenge <eos> like an animal <eos> so i cannot help <eos> but watch him searchin <eos> for lucky breaks <eos> just like a vulture <eos> and wonder if <eos> his sense of purpose is any less than what im gettin here <eos> bettered by wealth <eos> and education <eos> but just as unsettled <eos> and impatient <eos> i am too easily sustained <eos> i cant sleep <eos> if i am made to obey <eos> then why this brain <eos> this plague of intellect that infects <eos> any peaceful state <eos> cause i cant say <eos> if anything <eos> is meaningful <eos> or some impulse to trick me into <eos> another day <eos> of this grey feed me make yourself proud <eos> fill my mouth up until i drown <eos> you pull me onto dry land <eos> and choke me out with the same two hands <eos> we die and never come back <eos> and each of us has to learn from scratch <eos> so im left to follow my gut <eos> but who in the fuck can i trust when my own blood <eos> lies to me <eos> leads my mouth to drink <eos> and then punishes me in the morning <eos> i have no <eos> kind of hold <eos> to pull myself from cold grief <eos> that fills my heart with warning <eos> so i fight but i cant stop the bite of these teeth <eos> dont you flatter yourself <eos> we give or we take but were only selfish <eos> just blinking counting our days <eos> watching the shadows upon this cave we were sitting at a table at a little caf <eos> cleaning our plates like some kind of a race <eos> we finished our meal without making a sound <eos> i glanced at him he flagged the waitress down <eos> she brought us our check and said will that be all <eos> he said yeah thanks and sent her off with a nod <eos> im sure she was thinking i dont know about those guys <eos> but when she counted her tip she had to smile <eos> what i got from him is my stubborn side <eos> and the tapping my fingers on the wheel when i drive <eos> and the gift of keeping strangers an arms length away <eos> not knowing what im thinking behind my poker face <eos> when im stuck in a crowd at a party somewhere <eos> with people that im supposed to know <eos> i dont do small talk but ill shake your hand <eos> youll wonder about me and ill consider us friends <eos> what i got from him is my quiet side <eos> and annoying everybody with how slow i can drive <eos> and the habit of never calling anybody by name <eos> so theyre never quite sure if i know who they are <eos> as they try to read my poker face <eos> if you see us out at some little caf <eos> cleaning our plates like some kind of a race <eos> and you cant figure out if were happy or mad <eos> thats the way that we like it me and my dad <eos> i tend to be a little bit cheap <eos> but i tip pretty well and im easy to please <eos> and i like keeping strangers an arms length away <eos> and i like keeping secrets behind my poker face tonight in carolina the bleachers are empty and quiet <eos> not a balls been hit my way all night <eos> i hit a grounder up the middle but the shortstop made the play <eos> ill never make it to the big leagues this way <eos> but the smell of fresh cut grass and peanut shells fill the southern sky <eos> and well be heading back to birmingham tonight <eos> chorus <eos> these towns roll by like tumbleweeds <eos> through the windows of these latenight trains <eos> to those of us down here its still a game <eos> i may never be a hero and youll never know my name <eos> but if i broke the record i would do it clean <eos> last week out in greenville about an hour before the game <eos> a boy was watching warmups with a big smile on his face <eos> he put down his popcorn held out a ball and pen <eos> he looked a little awestruck as i signed it for him <eos> i didnt ask for money i just smiled and shook his hand <eos> you shouldve seen the spring in his step as he ran to show his dad <eos> <eos> repeat chorus <eos> americas favorite pastime its simple and its pure <eos> we all still watch the big leagues but now were not so sure <eos> but if you can catch a game in birmingham on a perfect summer day <eos> ill run out every grounder thats how i learned to play <eos> its not glamorous in double a its not for everyone <eos> but baseballs what i do who i am and what i love the pocket is torn from the years its spent catching <eos> the car keys and the spare change <eos> you can tell its been worn from the tears in the stitching <eos> this old sweatshirts seen better days <eos> in march i was traveling through this town <eos> and wanted a cheap souvenir <eos> i would never have guessed from the name on the chest <eos> that one day id end up living here <eos> bought me the chance to stay warm for the night <eos> now in my mind it takes straight back to that place and that time <eos> its amazing the things you can buy for <eos> i can still picture the red in her face <eos> just as clear as this stain on the sleeve <eos> she was convinced that shed ruined our first date <eos> when she spilled her coffee on me <eos> but the heat was no match for the look that she had <eos> as the air outside kept getting colder <eos> we drove to the beach and she shivered beside me <eos> and i draped it over her shoulders <eos> bought her the chance to stay warm for the night <eos> now in my mind it takes me straight back to that place and that time <eos> its amazing the things you can buy for <eos> its just bucks at the courthouse downtown <eos> for the papers to make her my bride <eos> i dig through the pocket and come up one coin short <eos> the judge says that hell let it slide <eos> its amazing the things you can buy <eos> bought me the chance to look back on my life <eos> one day in my mind i will remember this place and this time <eos> its amazing the things you can buy for rien ne presse <eos> sur les fesses de la vã©nus de milo <eos> plus un geste cest la sieste des oiseaux <eos> rien

a mile from jersey <eos> the headlights on the shore <eos> you know how much it hurts me <eos> i never been this deep before <eos> and im not myself <eos> when im with you <eos> it takes and breaks <eos> my heart in two <eos> and oh does anybody have a clue <eos> how hard i worked at loving you <eos> and im not myself <eos> when im with you <eos> it takes and breaks <eos> my heart in two the phone rings <eos> and i dont care who it is that is calling <eos> you moved our things from ours to his <eos> while outside the snow is falling <eos> the wedding band that meant so much <eos> signified our blessed vow <eos> like coffee spills and unpaid bills and all my pills <eos> its in a dusty dresser drawer now <eos> i watched these trees from green to brown <eos> suddenly this small town has gotten smaller <eos> the arctic breeze it sings to me and says now look <eos> any fool can go out and walk on water <eos> i shoulda known that time alone <eos> would only serve to break you down <eos> dont know why i sit and stare at that damn thing sitting there <eos> in a dusty dresser drawer now <eos> snow has turned to water <eos> to please the trees <eos> and cheer up that late bloomer <eos> while im sipping on a beer counting down another year <eos> couldnt come a second sooner <eos> i wonder how easily that ring it slid off of your finger <eos> did you stop for a moment <eos> let the memory of us linger <eos> or was it just an afterthought <eos> like casting water from a bow <eos> im past the point of crying <eos> for a love that lies there dying <eos> in a dusty dresser drawer now <eos> its such a goddamn shame <eos> right next to your picture frame <eos> in a dusty dresser drawer now <eos> if anybody asks me what i think that love is for now ill tell them <eos> look in a dusty dresser drawer now i never meant to be a burden <eos> oh i just worry more than id like to <eos> i never meant to be a burden <eos> please forgive me if ive weighed on you <eos> for so long i have lived amongst the shadows <eos> waiting for the sun to break on through <eos> oh its time i cast my oars and head out on these shores <eos> and find some place where i can start anew <eos> i never meant to be a burden <eos> oh i just worry more than id like to <eos> i never meant to be a burden <eos> please forgive me if ive weighed on you <eos> oh forgive if ive weighed upon your back <eos> its so heavy already without me <eos> going ahead into this abyss and find my own way out of this <eos> so you can walk ahead more easily <eos> i never meant to be a burden <eos> but youre the light that is guiding me through <eos> i never meant to be a burden <eos> please forgive me if ive weighed on you <eos> please forgive me if ive weighed on you <eos> please forgive me if ive weighed on you <eos> burden amos lee verse <eos> well the morning came like a freight train bearing down on me from a <eos> thousand miles a way <eos> well it came and gone and kept rolling on laying up all night with tear <eos> stained sheet as my veil <eos> chorus <eos> i donã¢âât want to see you again i donã¢âât want to feel your breath <eos> as you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept

where else to go <eos> cause his rent i couldnt afford <eos> well relationships change <eos> though i think its kind of strange <eos> how money makes a man grow <eos> ah some people they claim <eos> if you get enough fame <eos> you live over the rainbow over the rainbow <eos> but the people on the street <eos> out on buses or on feet <eos> we all got the same blood flow <eos> oh in society every dollar got a deed <eos> we all need a place that we can go <eos> and feel over the rainbow <eos> sometimes we forget what we got <eos> who we are or who we are not <eos> i think we got a chance to make it right <eos> keep it loose keep it tight keep it tight <eos> im in love with a girl whos in love with the world <eos> though i cant help but follow <eos> though i know someday she is bound to go away <eos> and stay over the rainbow <eos> got to learn how to let her go over the rainbow <eos> but sometimes we forget who we got <eos> who they are or who they are not <eos> there is so much more in love than black and white <eos> keep it loose child you gotta keep tight <eos> keep it loose keep it tight keep it tight <eos> keep it tight yeah my soul is as open as the sky <eos> often time its just as blue <eos> people tell me to keep on dreaming <eos> thats just what im gonna do <eos> now everybody want to treat me like a house fly <eos> turn me around and tell me to shoo <eos> they

in the darkness where it grows <eos> i know how hard it is to keep your head up kid <eos> to keep your head up kid <eos> and there you sit on high all tucked away and locked up in the clouds <eos> waiting for someone to finally come along and take you out <eos> into this bitter world that also often treated you so cruel <eos> when they turn away you know that they will say that youre a fool <eos> i know how hard it is to keep your head up kid <eos> i know how hard it is to keep your head up kid <eos> and so patiently you waited for a love to come along <eos> take you out into this bitter world so often done you wrong <eos> there you sit alone and there you shed a solitary tear <eos> listening to a song you think that no one else would ever hear <eos> i know how hard it is to keep your head up kid <eos> i know how hard it is to keep your head up <eos> keep your head up keep your head up <eos> keep your head up keep your head up the one i love is lost without the least bit of

famine crossed the waters thatll be the end of you <eos> ive heard of people who till the earth <eos> who saw their seeds for all theyre worth <eos> who cry for rain all summer long <eos> and weep for the day when winters passed and gone <eos> if cherry trees bore fruit of gold <eos> the birds would die their wings would fold <eos> theyd sing no more their song of love <eos> nor await the morning sun that lights the sky above <eos> if war returns like it did before <eos> a kiddys penny would be no more <eos> theyd cry for love and their candy too <eos> but a kiddys wants are nothing till

chilled my heart <eos> killed our love right from the start <eos> and visions of your face <eos> twist in my mind into knots of silken lace <eos> a chance to win a hand so fair <eos> fades with night and a single prayer <eos> then a straw hat on her head <eos> brings morning dreams to alight upon my bed <eos> if dead men swam the waters deep <eos> then fish would cry all in their sleep <eos> my love i can only try <eos> to lift my hat from the depths as you walk by <eos> now banjos ring and fiddles play <eos> a candle burns to light my way <eos> and turning in my sleep <eos> i dream again of

<eos> and all your glories stand revealed <eos> to our admiring eye <eos> you wills of nature speed your course <eos> you mortal powers decay <eos> fast as you bring the night of death <eos> you bring eternal day <eos> you weary heavyladen souls <eos> who are oppressed sore <eos> you travelers through the wilderness <eos> to canaans peaceful shore <eos> through beating winds and chilly rains <eos> and waters deep and cold <eos> and enemies surrounding you <eos> have courage and be bold <eos> the storms and hurricanes arise <eos> the desert all around <eos> and fiery serpents oft appear <eos> through the enchanted ground <eos> dark night and clouds and gloomy fear <eos> and dragons often roar <eos> but when the gospel trump we hear <eos> well press for canaans shore she went into the graveyard with trouble on her mind <eos> she was lookin for the man who make her crazy <eos> from her big brown coat she puller a silver knife <eos> as she held it in her hand her heart was racing <eos> youre low down and dirty and i love the way you do <eos> if i stay ill never find my way back home <eos> its been nine long years since you took my hand <eos> ill never understand what made you do it <eos> and how you twisted up my soul through me in a hole <eos> i didnt come this far to see you through it <eos> youre low down and dirty and i love the way you do <eos> if i stay ill never find my way back home <eos> babe im sorry for you but its what i have to do <eos> you died that night beneath the leaves have fallen <eos> and the devil will stand by smilin bright his pitchfork high <eos> a ghost from all these graves will come a callin <eos> youre low down and dirty and i love the way you do <eos> if i stay ill never find my way back home <eos> so she stabbed him in the heart <eos> her shinning blade it ripped apart <eos> his skin and pierced thought the center <eos> and i lay my body down through me on the ground <eos> and cover me so i can hide from my dominator <eos> youre low down and dirty <eos> so low down <eos> youre low down and dirty and i love the way you do x <eos> if i stay ill never find my way back home "good mornin my darlin" i said from the door <eos> my bags are all packed you wont see me anymore <eos> the room it was empty except for your clothes <eos> and a picture of the forest through the dimly lit smoke <eos> did you sleep well did you sleep fine <eos> did you sleep much at all <eos> all night i heard two voices from out here in the hall <eos> the first one was lonesome and the second one was clear <eos> the first one was familiar as the second drew near <eos> she walked to the window to expose the light <eos> her breath hung in silence like the fog in the night <eos> the sun raised its head from behind the frost <eos> she sat down by the stove with her long legs crossed <eos> did you sleep well did you sleep fine <eos> did you sleep much at all <eos> all night i heard two voices from out here in the hall <eos> the first one was ancient but the second was a gun <eos> the first one was laughin before the second was done <eos> she drew up her eyes and then turned my way <eos> her mouth it was movin but the words tried to stay <eos> her posture was thin and her tears they were tall <eos> like the picture of the forest in the fire in the hall <eos> did you sleep well did you sleep fine <eos> did you sleep much at all <eos> all night i heard two voices from out here in the hall <eos> the first it was singing and the second dressed in red <eos> the first one was hungry and the second was well fed <eos> my struggles were hard and my journey was long <eos> my food was your beauty and my water your song <eos> i returned for your voice and your precious melody <eos> i heard them both but you sang not for me <eos> did you sleep well did you sleep fine <eos> did you sleep much at all <eos> all night i heard two voices from out here in the hall <eos> the first was a flower and the second was a train <eos> the first issued warning and the second brought the rain <eos> day is breaking its time for me to leave <eos> each breath im taking reminds me to grieve <eos> youve proven false but another will be true <eos>

<eos> i kept on searching not counting the cost <eos> and overjoyed when i found the lost" over yonder in the graveyard <eos> where the wild wild flowers grow <eos> there they laid my own true lover <eos> shed gone from me forever more <eos> fairer than the sweetest flower <eos> restless as the wildest way <eos> pored in with love deep as a ocean <eos> this is the girl that i did win <eos> i left her there back in the mountain <eos> to see the world riches to gain <eos> oh when i returned no earthy treasure <eos> could ease this heart so filled with pain <eos> they saw high above the mountain

came to louisville <eos> some pleasure there to find <eos> a damsel there from lexington <eos> was pleasing to my mind <eos> her rosy cheeks <eos> her ruby lips <eos> like arrows pierced my breast <eos> the name she bore was flora <eos> the lily of the west <eos> i came to my love flora <eos> some pleasure there to find <eos> she turned in to another man <eos> which sort of stressed my mind <eos> she robbed me of my loyalty <eos> deprived me of my rest <eos> i loved my faithless flora <eos> the lily of the west <eos> now down in yonder shady grove <eos> the man who was to come <eos> conversing with my flora there <eos> it seemed so strange to me <eos> and the answer that she gave to him <eos> it sort of me oppressed <eos> i was betrayed by flora <eos> the lily of the west <eos> i stepped up to my rival <eos> my dagger in my hand <eos> i seized him by the collar <eos> and i boldly made him stand <eos> we met in desperation <eos> i pierced him in the breast <eos> i killed the man for flora <eos> the lily of the west im not apologizing <eos> for anything we do tonight <eos> just wanna dance with somebody <eos> whos looking to lose his mind <eos> mind and heart <eos> tied up in conversation <eos> theres no time <eos> no time for hesitation <eos> can we be untouchable tonight <eos> baby if we burn the city down <eos> well blame it on love blame it on love <eos> even if we

over the hills and far away <eos> he is my hero my gallant darling <eos> he is my caesar a gallant darling <eos> ive found neither rest nor fortune <eos> since my gallant darling went far away <eos> every day i am constantly enduring grief <eos> weeping nitterly and shedding tears <eos> because my lively lad has left me <eos> and no news is told of him alas <eos> the cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon <eos> and the sound of hounds is not heard in nuttree woods <eos> nor summer morning in misty glen <eos> since my lively boy went away from me <eos> noble proud young horseman <eos> youth without gloom of pleasant countenance <eos> a swiftmoving fist nimble in a fight <eos> slaying the enemy and smiting the strong <eos> let a strain be played on musical harps <eos> and let many quarts be filled on the table <eos> with high spirit without fault without gloom <eos> that my lion may receive long life and health <eos> gallant darling for a while under sorrow <eos> and ireland completely under black cloacks <eos> i have found neither rest nor fortune <eos> since my gallant darling went far away if it hadnt been for cottoneye joe <eos> id been married long time ago <eos>

<eos> until apples grow on an ivy tree <eos> for love it is pleasin and love is teasin <eos> and love is a treasure when first its new <eos> but as love grows older then love grows colder <eos> and it fades away like the morning dew <eos> there is a little house into town <eos> and there my love he sits him down <eos> he takes a strange girl on his knee <eos> and he tells her things that he wants to be <eos> for love and water make younger older <eos> and love and whiskey make her old and grey <eos> and what cannot be cured love must be endured love <eos> and now i am bound for america <eos> la la la la la la <eos> la la la la la la <eos> as life grows older sure love grows older <eos> and it fades away like the morning dew here we are weve come to call with pipes and flutes and fiddles

long to be no not the place across the sea <eos> but in county wickloe irelands lovely garden <eos> where no pretenders will you find but decent people warm and kind <eos> and flocks of friendly sheep into the bargain my own love said to me <eos> "my mother wont mind <eos> and my daughters wont slight you <eos> for your lack of kind" <eos> he went away from me <eos> and this he did say <eos> "it will not be long love <eos> till our wedding day" <eos> he went away from me <eos> and he moved through the fair <eos> and slowly i watched him <eos> move here and move there <eos> he went his way homeward <eos> with one star awake <eos> as this swan in the evening <eos> moves over the lake <eos> i dreamed last night <eos> that my own love came in <eos> he came in so sweetly <eos> his feet made no din <eos> he came close beside me <eos> and this he did say <eos> "it will not be long love <eos> till our wedding day" <eos> it will not be long love <eos> long love <eos> long love <eos> love when first i came to ireland some pleasure for to find <eos> its there i spied a damsel fair twas pleasing to my mind <eos> her rosy cheeks and sparklin eyes like arrows pierced my breast <eos> and i call her lovely molly o the lily of the west <eos> one day as i was walkin down by a shady grove <eos> i spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love <eos> she sang her song delightfully while i was sore oppressed <eos> saying ive been a dupe i bid adieu to molly o the lily of the west <eos> well i stepped up with my rapier and my dagger in my hand <eos> and i dragged him from my false love and boldly i bid him stand <eos> but being mad with desperation i swore id pierce his breast <eos> i was then deceived by molly o the lily of the west <eos> a flaw was in my indictment found and that soon had me free <eos> that beauty bright i did adore the judge did her address <eos> now go you faithless molly o the lily of the west <eos> now that ive gained my liberty arowin i will go <eos> i ramble through old ireland and travel scotland oer <eos> though she thought to swear my life away she still disturbs my rest <eos> i still must style her molly o the lily of the west i was down the glen one easter morn <eos> to a city fair rode i <eos> there armed lines of marching men <eos> in squadrons passed me by <eos> no pipe did hum no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo <eos> but the angelus bells oer the liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew <eos> right proudly high in dublin town <eos> hung they out a flag of war <eos> twas better to die neath that irish sky <eos> than at sulva or sud el bar <eos> and from the plains of royal meath <eos> strong men came hurrying through <eos> while brittanias huns with their long range guns <eos> sailed in through the foggy dew <eos> their bravest fell and the requiem bell <eos> rang mournfully and clear <eos> for those who died that eastertide in the <eos> springing of the year <eos> while the world did gaze with deep amaze <eos> at those fearless men but few <eos> who bore the fight that freedoms light <eos> might shine through the foggy dew <eos> and back through the glen <eos> i rode again <eos> and my heart with grief was sore <eos> for i parted then with valiant men <eos> whom i never shall see nmore <eos> but to and fro in my dreams i go <eos> and i kneel and pray for you <eos> for slavery fled oh glorious dead <eos> when you fell in the foggy dew have i told you lately that i love you <eos> have i told you theres no one above you <eos> fill my heart with gladness take away my sadness <eos> ease my troubles thats what you do <eos> oh the morning sun in all its glory <eos> greets the day with hope and comfort too <eos> and you fill my life with laughter you can make it better <eos> ease my troubles thats what you do <eos> theres a love thats divine <eos> and its yours and its mine <eos> like the sun at the end of the day <eos> we should give thanks and pray to the one <eos> say have i told you lately that i love you <eos> have i told you theres no one above you <eos> fill my heart with gladness take away my sadness <eos> ease my troubles thats what you do <eos> well theres a love thats divine <eos> and

dark eyed lonely maiden <eos> on the coast of malabar <eos> in the harbor where we anchored <eos> i can see her shy and sweet <eos> with a bunch of winered roses <eos> and the wild waves at her feet <eos> oh fare thee well my little dark eyed queen <eos> fare thee well my indian star <eos> in my heart youll live forever <eos> on the coast of malabar <eos> "come to me" i hear her calling <eos> across the ocean wild and far <eos> "come to me again and love me <eos> on the coast of malabar" <eos> and my thoughts keep ever turning <eos> to that faroff distant shore <eos> and the dark eyed girl who loved me <eos> but ill see her never more <eos> oh fare thee well my little dark eyed queen <eos> fare thee well my indian star <eos> in my heart youll live forever <eos> on the coast of malabar

delight <eos> o never give the heart outright <eos> for they for all smooth lips can say <eos> have given their hearts up to the play <eos> and who could play it well enough <eos> if deaf and dumb and blind with love <eos> he that made this knows all the cost <eos> for he gave all his heart and lost <eos> they for all smooth lips can say <eos> have given their hearts up to the play <eos> never give all the heart as i went out walking one fine summer morning <eos> the birds in the bushes did whistle and sing <eos> the lads and the lasses in couples were courtin <eos> going back to the factory their work to begin <eos> he spied one among them she was fairer then many <eos> her cheeks like the red rose that blooms in the spring <eos> her hair like the lily that grows in yon valley <eos> she was only a hardworking factory girl <eos> he sat soft beside her more closely to view her <eos> she says "my young man dont stare me so <eos> i gold in my pocket and silver as well <eos> no more will i answer that factory call" instrumental oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling <eos> from glen to glen and down the mountain side <eos> the summers gone and all the flowers falling <eos> ts you ts you must go and i must bide <eos> but come ye back when summers in meadow <eos> or when the valleys hushed and white with snow <eos> tis ill be there in sunshine or in the shadow <eos> oh danny boy oh danny boy i love you so <eos> and when you come and all the flowers are dying <eos> if i am dead as dead i will may be <eos> youll come and find the place where i am lying <eos> and neel and say an ave for me <eos> and i shall hear those soft you tread above me <eos> and all my grave will warm and sweeter be <eos> if you will built and tell me that you love me <eos> then i shall sleep in peace until you come to me i know my love by his way of walking <eos> and i know my love by his way of talking <eos> and i know my love dressed in a suit of blue <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do <eos> and still she cried "i love him the best <eos> and a troubled mind sure can know no rest" <eos> and still she cried "bonny boys are few <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do" <eos> there is a dance house in maradyke <eos> and there my true love goes every night <eos> he takes a strange girl upon his knee <eos> well now dont you think that that vexes me <eos> and still she cried "i love him the best <eos> and a troubled mind sure can know no rest" <eos> and still she cried "bonny boys are few <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do" <eos> if my love knew i can wash and wring <eos> if my love knew i can sew and spin <eos> id make a coat of the finest kind <eos> but the want of money sure leaves me behind <eos> and still she cried "i love him the best <eos> and a troubled mind sure can know no rest" <eos> and still she cried "bonny boys are few <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do" <eos> i know my love is an arrant rover <eos> i know hell wander the wild world over <eos> in dear old ireland hell no longer tarry <eos> an american girl hes sure to marry <eos> and still she cried "i love him the best <eos> and a troubled mind sure can know no rest" <eos> and still she cried "bonny boys are few <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do" <eos> and still she cried "i love him the best <eos> and a troubled mind sure can know no rest" <eos> and still she cried "bonny boys are few <eos> and if my love leaves me what will i do" <eos> what will i do youve got the world at your feet <eos> youve got them dancing in the street <eos> youve got them

dawn im the new day begun <eos> i bring you the morning i bring you the sun <eos> i hold back the night and i open the skies <eos> i give light to the world i give sight to your eyes <eos> from the first of all time until time is undone <eos> forever and ever and ever and ever <eos> and i am the dawn and the sky and the sun <eos> i am one with the one and i am the dawn tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone <eos> all her lovely companions are faded and gone <eos> no flower of her kindred no rosebud is nigh <eos> to reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh <eos> ill not leave thee thou lone one to pine on the stem <eos> since the lovely are sleeping go sleep thou with them <eos> thus kindly i scatter thy leaves oer the bed <eos> where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead <eos> so soon may i follow when friendships decay <eos> and from loves shining circle the gems drop away <eos> when true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown <eos> oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone <eos> this bleak world alone i dreamt i dwelt in marble halls <eos> with vassals and serfs at my side <eos> and of all who assembled within those walls <eos> that i was the hope and the pride <eos> i had riches all too great to count could boast <eos> of a high ancestral name <eos> but i also dreamt which pleased me most <eos> that you loved me still the same <eos> that you loved me <eos> you loved me still the same <eos> that you loved me <eos> you loved me still the same <eos> i dreamt that suitors sought my hand <eos> that knights upon bended knee <eos> and with vows no maidens heart could withstand <eos> they pledged their faith to me <eos> and i dreamt that one of that noble host <eos> came forth my hand to claim <eos> but i also dreamt which charmed me most <eos> that you loved me still the same <eos> that you loved me <eos> you loved me still the same <eos> that you loved me <eos> you loved me still the same are you going to scarborough

<eos> as some fair woman lost in cushions deep <eos> with gentle hand caresses listlessly <eos> the contour of her breasts before she sleeps <eos> on velvet backs of avalanches soft <eos> she often lies enraptured as she dies <eos> and gazes on white visions aloft <eos> which like a blossoming to heaven rise <eos> when sometimes on this globe in indolence <eos> she lets a secret tear drop down by chance <eos> a poet set against oblivion <eos> takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear <eos> this opal drop where rainbow hues appear <eos> and hides it in his breast far from the sun someday when we are wiser <eos> when the worlds older <eos> when we have learned <eos> i pray someday we may yet <eos> live to live and let live <eos> someday life will be fairer <eos> need will be rarer <eos> and greed will not pay <eos> godspeed this bright millenum <eos> on its way let it come someday <eos> someday our fight will be won then <eos> well stand in the sun then <eos> that the bright afternoon <eos> til then on days when the sun is gone <eos> well hang on if we wish upon the moon <eos> there are some days dark and bitter <eos> seems we havent got a prayer <eos> but a prayer for something better <eos> is the one thing we all share <eos> someday when we are wiser <eos> when the world is older <eos> when we have love <eos> and i pray someday we may yet <eos> live to live and one day someday <eos> someday life will be fairer <eos> need will be rarer <eos> and greed will not pay <eos> godspeed this bright millennium <eos> let it come <eos> if we wish upon the moon <eos> one

as we fly <eos> were holding very tight <eos> im riding in the midnight blue <eos> and finding i can fly so high above with you <eos> all across the world <eos> the villages go by like dreams <eos> the rivers and the hills the forests and the streams <eos> children gaze openmouthed <eos> taken by surprise <eos> nobody down below believes their eyes <eos> were surfing in the air <eos> were swimming in the frozen sky <eos> were drifting over icy mountains floating by <eos> suddenly swooping low <eos> on an ocean deep <eos> rising up a mighty monster from his sleep <eos> were walking in the air <eos> were dancing in the midnight sky <eos> and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly i hear a baby crying <eos> a sad sound a lonely sound <eos> i want to take her in my arms <eos> and then i dry away all her tears <eos> i see a boy whos frightened <eos> a young boy with old eyes <eos> i long to say youre welcome here <eos> you can be happy now that youre warm <eos> were all a part of one world <eos> we all can share the same dream <eos> and if you just reach out to me <eos> then you will find deep down inside <eos> im just like you <eos> loud voices raised in anger <eos> speak harsh words such cruel words <eos> why do they speak so selfishly <eos> when we have got so much we can share <eos> so let your hearts be open <eos> and reach out with all your love <eos> there are no strangers now <eos> they are our brothers now and we are one <eos> were all a part of one world <eos> we all can share the same dream <eos> and if you just reach out to me <eos> then you will find deep down inside <eos> im just like you <eos> were all a part of one world <eos> we all can share the same dream <eos> and if you just reach out to me <eos> then you will find deep down inside <eos> im just like you im just like you ive met some folks who say that im a dreamer <eos> and ive no doubt theres truth in what they say <eos> but sure a bodys bound to be a dreamer <eos> when all the things he loves are far away <eos> and precious things are dreams unto an exile <eos> they take him oer the land across the sea <eos> especially when it happens hes an exile <eos> from that dear lovely isle of inisfree <eos> and when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops <eos> of this great city wondrous though it be <eos> i scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter <eos> im once again back home in inisfree <eos> i wander oer green hills through dreamy valleys <eos> and find a peace no other land would know <eos> i hear the birds make music fit for angels <eos> and watch the rivers laughing as they flow <eos> and then into a humble shack i wander <eos> my dear old home and tenderly behold <eos> the folks i love around the turf fire gathered <eos> on bended knees their rosary is told <eos> but dreams dont last <eos> though dreams are not forgotten <eos> and soon im back to stern reality <eos> but though they pave the footways here with gold dust <eos> i still would choose my isle of inisfree when the light begins to fade <eos> and shadows fall across the sea <eos> one bright star in the evening sky <eos> your loves light leads me on my way <eos> theres a dream that will not sleep <eos> a burning hope that will not die <eos> so i must go now with the wind <eos> and leave you waiting on the tide <eos> time to fly time to touch the sky <eos> one voice alone a haunting cry <eos> one song one star burning bright <eos> may it carry me through darkest night <eos> rain comes over the gray hills <eos> and on the air a soft goodbye <eos> hear the song that i sing to you <eos> when the time has come to fly ave maria <eos> gratia plena dominus tecum <eos> benedicta tu in mulieribus <eos> et benedictus fructus ventris tui jesus <eos> sancta maria sancta maria maria

the sky above ashokan <eos> the pines and the willows know soon we will part <eos> theres a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken <eos> and a love that will always remain in my heart <eos> my thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter <eos> the magic of moving as one <eos> and a time well remember long ever after <eos> the moonlight and music and dancing are done <eos> will we climb the hills once more <eos> will we walk the woods together <eos> will i feel you holding me close once again <eos> will every song weve sung stay with us forever <eos> will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then <eos> under the moon the mountains lie sleeping <eos> over the lake the stars shine <eos> they wonder if you and i will be keeping <eos> the magic and music or leave them behind

and this she did say <eos> "it will not be long love till our wedding day" <eos> she stepped away from me and she moved thru the fair <eos> and fondly i watched her move here and move there <eos> and she made her way homeward with one star awake <eos> as swan in the evening moves over the lake <eos> last night she came to me she came softly in <eos> so softly she came that her feet made no din <eos> and she laid her hand on me and this she did say <eos> "it will not be long love till our wedding day" oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling <eos> from glen to glen and down the mountain

rise over claddagh <eos> and see the sun go down on galway bay <eos> just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream <eos> the women in the meadow making hay <eos> just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin <eos> and watch the barefoot gosoons as they play <eos> ooh <eos> for the breezes blowing oer the seas from ireland <eos> are perfumed by the heather as they blow <eos> and the women in the uplands digging praties <eos> speak a language that the strangers do not know <eos> yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways <eos> and they scorned us just for being what we are <eos> but they might as well go chasin after moon beams <eos> or light a penny candle from a star <eos> and if theres gonna be a life here after <eos> and faith somehow im sure theres gonna be <eos> i will ask my god to let me make my heaven <eos> in that dear land across the irish sea <eos> i will ask my god to let me make my heaven <eos> in my dear land across the irish sea <eos> ooh <eos> in my dear

january <eos> eighteen ninetytwo <eos> they opened ellis island and they let <eos> the people through <eos> and the first to cross the threshold <eos> of that isle of hope and tears <eos> was annie moore from ireland <eos> who was all of fifteen years <eos> chorus <eos> isle of hope isle of tears <eos> isle of freedom isle of fears <eos> but its not the isle you left behind <eos> that isle of hunger isle of pain <eos> isle youll never see again <eos> but the isle of home is always on your mind <eos> in a little bag she carried <eos> all her past and history <eos> and her dreams for the future <eos> in the land of liberty <eos> and courage is the passport <eos> when your old world disappears <eos> but theres no future in the past <eos> when youre fifteen years <eos> chorus <eos> when

understood <eos> now we are not afraid <eos> although we know theres much to fear <eos> we were moving mountains long <eos> before we knew we could <eos> there can be miracles when you believe <eos> though hope is frail its hard to kill <eos> who knows what miracles you can achieve <eos> when you believe somehow you will <eos> you will when you believe <eos> in this time of fear <eos> when prayers so often proves in vain <eos> hope seems like the summer birds <eos> too swiftly flown away <eos> yet now im standing here <eos> my hearts so full i cant explain <eos> seeking faith and speaking words <eos> i never thought id say <eos> there can be miracles when you believe <eos> though hope is frail its hard to kill <eos> who knows what miracles you can achieve <eos> when you believe somehow you will <eos> you will when you believe <eos> they dont always happen when you ask <eos> oh <eos> and its easy to give in to your fears <eos> oh oh <eos> but when youre blinded by your pain <eos> cant see your way straight thought the rain <eos> a small but still resilient voice <eos> says hope is very near <eos> oh <eos> there can be miracles <eos> miracles <eos> when you

child were lying there on a bed <eos> a bright light of silver shone round his head <eos> and he had the face of an angel and they were afraid <eos> then the stranger spoke he said "do not fear <eos> i come from a planet a long way from here <eos> and i bring a message for mankind to hear" <eos> and suddenly the sweetest music filled the air <eos> and it went la la la la la la la la la la <eos> la

hearing that sound <eos> and travelers on the road the village they found <eos> by the light of that ship in the sky <eos> which shone all around <eos> and just before dawn at the paling of the sky <eos> the stranger returned and said "now i must fly <eos> when two thousand years of your time has gone by <eos> this song will begin once again to a babys cry" <eos> and it went la la la la la la la

fondly i watched her move here and move there <eos> and she made her way homeward with one star awake <eos> as swan in the evening moves over the lake <eos> last night she came to me she came softly in <eos> so softly she came that her feet made no din <eos> and she laid her hand on me and this she did say <eos> "it will not be long love till our wedding day" walking in the air floating the sky <eos> floating in the air <eos> were walking in the air <eos> were floating in the moonlit sky <eos> the people far below are sleeping as we fly <eos> were holding very tight <eos> im riding in the midnight blue <eos> im finding i can fly so high above with you <eos> far across the world <eos> the villages go by like trees <eos> the rivers and the hills <eos> the forest and the streams <eos> children gaze open mouth <eos> taken by surprise <eos> nobody down below believes their eyes <eos> were surfing in the air <eos> were swimming in the frozen sky <eos> were drifting over icy <eos> mountains floating by <eos> suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep <eos> arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep <eos> were walking in the air <eos> were dancing in the midnight sky <eos> and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly sometimes we stumble <eos> sometimes we even fall <eos> and we cant find a friend <eos> cant comprehend it all <eos> and we are lost <eos> with nothing to hold on to <eos> when we cant find the answer <eos> sometimes a prayer will do <eos> and though we wonder <eos> uncertain if we will get through <eos> to face the future <eos> sometimes a prayer will do <eos> sometimes we reach <eos> for whats not really there <eos> sometimes we lose our grip <eos> come tumbling through midair <eos> and we are searching <eos> for something to hold on to <eos> when we cant find the answer <eos> sometimes a prayer will do <eos> and though we wonder <eos> uncertain if we will get through <eos> to face the future <eos> sometimes a prayer will do <eos> yeah we are stronger <eos> somehow we know we will get through <eos> to face the future <eos> sometimes a prayer will do <eos> sometimes a prayer will do sure you ride the finest horse i have ever seen <eos> standing sixteen one or two with eyes wild and green <eos> and you ride the horse well hands light to the touch <eos> i could never go with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> when you ride into the night without a trace behind <eos> run your claw along my gut one last time <eos> i turn to face an empty space where you used to lie <eos> i look for the spark that lights the night <eos> through the teardrop in my eye <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> ride on see you i could never go <eos> with you no matter how i wanted to <eos> i could never go with you <eos> no matter how i wanted to <eos> oh i could never go with you <eos> no matter how i wanted to oh misty eye of the mountain below <eos> keep careful watch of my brothers soul <eos> and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke <eos> keep watching over durins son <eos> if this is to end in fire <eos> we should all burn together <eos> watch the flames climb high into night <eos> calling out father oh <eos> stand by and we will <eos> watch the flames burn <eos> auburn on the mountain side <eos> oh <eos> and if we should die tonight <eos> we should all die together <eos> watching flames climb high <eos> for the last time <eos> calling out father oh <eos> prepare us we will <eos> watch the flames burn <eos> auburn on mountain side <eos> desolation comes upon the sky <eos> now i see fire inside the mountain <eos> i see fire burning the tree <eos> i see fire hollowing souls <eos> and i see fire blood in the breeze <eos> and i hope that you remember me <eos> should my people fall <eos> surely ill do the same <eos> confined in mountain halls <eos> we got to close to the flames <eos> calling out father oh <eos> hold fast and we will <eos> watch the flames burn <eos> auburn on the mountain side <eos> desolation comes upon the sky <eos> now i see fire inside the mountain <eos> i see fire burning the trees <eos> i see fire hollowing souls <eos> i see fire blood in the breeze <eos> and i hope that you remember me <eos> and if the night is burning <eos> i will cover my eyes <eos> for if the dark returns <eos> then my brothers will die <eos> and as the sky is falling down <eos> it crashed into this lonely town <eos> and with that shadow on the ground <eos> i hear my people screaming out <eos> i see fire inside the mountain <eos> i see fire burning the trees <eos> i see fire hollowing souls <eos> i see fire blood in the breeze <eos> i see fire fire <eos> and i see fire fire <eos> and i see fire fire <eos> and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side a child begins with one single step <eos> then walks a million miles <eos> and though these wings are not ready yet <eos> i will try to fly <eos> my eyes cant see <eos> my arms cant reach <eos> and needs strength when im weak <eos> and need your faith in me <eos> dont walk in front of me <eos> i was not born to follow <eos> dont walk behind me <eos> we were all born to lead <eos> dont walk without me <eos> i might need you tomorrow <eos> walk right beside me <eos> be the real friend i need <eos> if you take small stones one at a time <eos> you will move that whole mountain <eos> if you climb each rainbow <eos> its gold that youll find <eos> and shelter from the rain

<eos> through all the tumult and the strife <eos> i hear its music ringing <eos> it ever echoes in my life <eos> how can i keep from singing <eos> and though the shadows gather round <eos> the endless song it giveth <eos> my strength within and joy abound <eos> the world of truth it liveth <eos> though dark the night and long the road <eos> i hear the music ringing <eos> and with such power and grace bestowed <eos> how can i keep from singing <eos> no storm can shake my inmost calm <eos> while to this rock im clinging <eos> how can i ever come to harm <eos> how can i keep from singing <eos>

cry <eos> open your heart <eos> i am calling you <eos> right from the very start <eos> your wounded heart was calling too <eos> open your arms <eos> you will find the answer <eos> when you answer to the call <eos> sometimes it is in desire <eos> or in the love we fear <eos> when the call is calling us <eos> till the fear will disappear <eos> when we have no dance to dance <eos> the call is in the song <eos> when we have no voice to sing <eos> then the call is calling strong <eos> open your heart <eos> i am calling you <eos> right from the very start <eos> your wounded heart was calling too <eos> open your arms <eos> you will find the answer <eos> when you answer to the call <eos> open your heart <eos> i am calling you <eos> right from the very start <eos> your wounded heart was calling

always remain in my heart <eos> my thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter <eos> the magic of moving as one <eos> and a time well remember long ever after <eos> the moonlight and music and dancing are done <eos> will we climb the hills once more <eos> will we walk the woods together <eos> will i feel you holding me close once again <eos> will every song weve sung stay with us forever <eos> will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then <eos> under the moon the mountains lie sleeping <eos> over the lake the stars shine <eos> they wonder if you and i will be keeping <eos> the magic and music or leave them behind theres a place for us <eos> somewhere a place for us <eos> peace and quiet and open air <eos> wait for us somewhere <eos> theres a time for us <eos> some day a time for us <eos> time together and time to spare <eos> time to learn time to care <eos> some day somewhere <eos> well find a new way of living <eos> well find a way of forgiving <eos> somewhere <eos> theres a place for us <eos> somewhere a place for us <eos> time together with time to spare <eos> time to learn time to care <eos> some day somewhere <eos> well find a new way of living <eos> well find a way of forgiving <eos> somewhere <eos> hold my hand and ill take you there <eos> somehow some day somewhere my true love sits in a forest glade <eos> in the springtimes golden light <eos> the flowers they dance in the gentle breeze <eos> and the warm sun shines so bright <eos> and of all the flowers in the forest <eos> and all trees that do abound <eos> the ones that please my heart the most <eos> are green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> the holly yew and the ivy tree <eos> are green the whole year round <eos> when summer comes and the days are hot <eos> and the birds are full of song <eos> in the quiet shade of that leafy glade <eos> that is where my heart belongs <eos> for i know whenever i look for you <eos> that is where you can be found <eos> as you take your ease neath your favorite trees <eos> that are green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> the holly yew and the ivy tree <eos> are green the whole year round <eos> but the summer fades and the days grow short <eos> and the autumn winds they blow <eos> and the leaves of gold come tumbling down <eos> to the forest far below <eos> memories of other days come tumbling from the past <eos> to remind us like the seasons do <eos> that life goes by so fast <eos> the winter lays her fingers cold <eos> on dark and lonely nights <eos> but christmas it will soon be here <eos> to usher in the light <eos> and when morning breaks and the bells ring out <eos> it is such a joyous sound <eos> to hear them echo in the trees <eos> that are green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> the holly yew and the ivy tree <eos> are green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> the holly yew and the ivy tree <eos> are green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> green the whole year round <eos> the holly yew and the ivy tree <eos> are green the whole year round shule shule shule aroon <eos> shule go sukar agus shule go kewn <eos> shule go durrus oggus aylig lume <eos> shule shule shule

still here <eos> i feel you all around me <eos> your memories so clear <eos> deep in the stillness <eos> i can hear you speak <eos> youre still an inspiration <eos> can it be <eos> that you are mine

she tried her very best <eos> she is a good companion <eos> chorus <eos> he stores away the moments of her smiles <eos> as if they were rare butterflies <eos> stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles <eos> then barters for the merchandise <eos> when life it drags the likes of me around <eos> just when we need some time alone <eos> you have a simple mansion underground <eos> without address or telephone <eos> chorus we search for everything <eos> keeping what we would win <eos> orchids or tiny flowers <eos> wooden huts or ivory towers <eos> centuries or hours <eos> dark are the winter days <eos> holy in many ways <eos> vaults of time unshaken <eos> whilst as through them we are taken <eos> sleeping forests wake <eos> ice melts on the lake <eos> birds begin in making their way back home <eos> the frost and the fire goes <eos> east winds and winter snows <eos> sun upon the daffodils <eos> dancing on the verdant hills <eos> lambs in the fields <eos> warmer grows the morning sun <eos> days of youthfulness and fun <eos> the prime of the year begun <eos> the song of summer to be sung <eos> everything is one <eos> working day is done <eos> watch the river running through our lives <eos> how slowly the colors change <eos> we feel the drops of rain <eos> mists of evening rise again <eos> we rarely stroll the shadowed lanes <eos> as autumn night draws in <eos> we sit upon the sand <eos> warmth draining from the land <eos> watching the ruby sun <eos> setting on the ocean <eos> the echoes in the caves <eos> the flame upon the waves <eos> memories for saving all our days by sandy denny ufo music inc c <eos> the lady she had a silver longue <eos> for to sing she said <eos> and maybe thats all <eos> wait for the dawn and we will have that song <eos> when it ends it will seem <eos> that we hear silence fall <eos> the lady she had a golden heart <eos> for to love she said <eos> and she did not lie <eos> wait for the dawn and well watch for the sun <eos> as we turn it will seem <eos> to arise in the sky <eos> we heard that song while watching the skies <eos> oh the sound it rang <eos> so clear through the cold <eos> then silence fell and the sun did arise <eos> on a beautiful morning of silver and gold although the flames they are so dim <eos> i can see them from over here <eos> but this is no time to worry now <eos> no time to shed a tear <eos> the people are all smiling <eos> and the letters are all too <eos> the flowers they are all arranged <eos> and the notes they are all blue <eos> where are the words to say to you <eos> where do they all begin <eos> i should not have a lot to lose <eos> and everything to win <eos> and i want you to be smiling <eos> i want you not to cry <eos> and even if i hide away <eos> then youll get the notion why <eos> a symphony i learnt at school <eos> in pigeonholes so clear <eos> but it made me for to write no songs <eos> for nobody to hear <eos> and i see you are all smiling <eos> even in the candle light <eos> just close your eyes and fall asleep <eos> and i think youll be alright <eos> close your eyes and fall asleep <eos> and i think youll be alright sandy denny <eos> they stood upon the deck <eos> as the ship went out to sea <eos> the wind it took the sails <eos> and left the land a memory <eos> all upon the shore for <eos> to wonder why the sailor goes <eos> all to close their eyes <eos> and wonder what the sailor knows <eos> that is you to they <eos> that is how they think you are <eos> never on the land <eos> but sailing by the north star <eos> that is you to them <eos> that is how they think you are <eos> never on the land <eos> but sailing by the north star <eos> to the tower and to the ravens and <eos> the tale that hopes theyll never leave <eos> what if they should go <eos> we always dread to think of them <eos> i wonder if they flew one day <eos> and no one ever knew theyd gone <eos> to circle over ships at sea <eos> claiming yet another son <eos> that is you to me <eos> that is where i think you are <eos> never on the land <eos> but gone to find the north star the wine it was drunk the ship it was sunk <eos> the shot it was dead all the sorrows were drowned <eos> the birds they were clouds the brides and the shrouds <eos> and as we drew south the mist it came down <eos> the wooded ravine to the wandering stream <eos> the serpent he moved but noone would say <eos> the depths of the waters the bridge which distraught us <eos> and brought to me thoughts of the illfated day <eos> the temples were filled with the strangest of creatures <eos> one played it by ear on the banks of the sea <eos> that one was found but the others they went under <eos> oh the tears which are shed they wont come from me <eos> the methods of madness the pathos and the sadness <eos> god help you all the insane and wise <eos> the black and the white the darkness of the night <eos> i see only smoke from the chimneys arise by sandy denny ufo music inc c <eos> im a long way from you <eos> im a long way from home <eos> and who cares for the f <eos> of being alone <eos> the notes and the words <eos> they will always unfold <eos> and im left with a manuscript <eos> that will grow old <eos> and the secrets all told anyway <eos> so the song it is yours <eos> and the song it is mine <eos> and a cold wind it blows <eos> through good fortunes of time <eos> the hobo he leaves <eos> when the going is bad <eos> and the music he weaves <eos> is so gentle and sad <eos> but freedom he has anyway <eos> prepared by paul hosken rmcbvmopdlrde such sweet love is so hard to find <eos> look around

<eos> chorus by sandy denny ufo music inc c <eos> oh its like a storm at sea <eos> and everything is lost <eos> and the fretful sailors <eos> calling out their woes <eos> as to the waves theyre tossed <eos> oh they are all gentlemen <eos> and never will they know <eos> if there is a reason each of them <eos> must go <eos> to join the cruel flow <eos> and itll take a long long time <eos> itll take a long long time <eos> itll take a long long time <eos> oh itll take such a long long time <eos> there is no need for rules <eos> theres no one to score the game <eos> and there is no body <eos> living

built by some man in a rhyme <eos> but whatever came of his talented son <eos> who wrote me a dialogue set to a tune <eos> always you told me of being alone <eos> except for the stories about god and you <eos> and do you still live there in buffalo <eos> they put up the walls with no more to say <eos> nobody stopped to ask why it was done <eos> the stream was too far and the rain was too high <eos> so into the city the river did run <eos> because of the architect the buildings fell down <eos> smothered or drowned all the seeds which were sown <eos> i wish i were somewhere but not in this town <eos> maybe the ocean next time around <eos> i seem to remember the face and the name <eos> but if its not you i wont care <eos> i know of changes but nothing would change you <eos> to theo the sailor who sings in his lair <eos> and then ill turn and he wont be there <eos> dusky black windows to light the dark stair <eos> candles all gnarled in the musty air <eos> all without flames for manys the year roses are red and violets are blue <eos> primroses pale on a velvet green hue <eos> warm summer days by cool waterfalls <eos> like the music we hear <eos> those things well always hold dear <eos> like an old fashioned waltz <eos> when the moonlight shines down <eos> on the hollywood world <eos> and the heroine waits <eos> for her beau to return <eos> and violins play <eos> from behind garden walls <eos> how id love to remain <eos> with the silver refrain <eos> of an old fashioned waltz <eos> as they dance round the floor <eos> and theres noone else there <eos> and the world is no more <eos> and theres never a care <eos> by the perfect lagoon <eos> where the nightingale calls <eos> with only the moon <eos> and the nostalgic tune <eos> of an old fashioned waltz <eos> roses are red and violets are blue <eos> primroses pale on a velvet green hue <eos> warm summer days by cool waterfalls <eos> like the music we hear <eos> those things well always hold dear <eos> like an old fashioned waltz <eos> like an old fashioned waltz <eos> an old fashioned waltz here comes the morning how it pleases <eos> it always brings me something new <eos> its golden light will wash away the dust of yesterday <eos> if i try it may let me forget you <eos> and when these winter days are over <eos> i mean to set myself upon my feet <eos> i see me as something that i have never been <eos> and ill pick up the pieces that will make the girl complete <eos> ill be smiling all the time at everybody <eos> my friends will tell me im just not the same <eos> i wont linger over any tragedies that were <eos> and i wont be singing any more sad refrains the summer was the reason <eos> why it took so long to see <eos> that even if i do possess <eos> some seeds of honesty <eos> there is no garden <eos> so how come i have no land <eos> i shall be waiting here awhile <eos> to see what comes to hand <eos> misers mise and compromise <eos> i know what i have seen <eos> the wanderers are in

blown away <eos> and the winter it is long one evening fair i took the air <eos> down by blackwaterside <eos> twas gazing all around me <eos> when the irish lad i spied <eos> all through the first part of that night <eos> we did lie in sport and play <eos> when this young man arose and he gathered his clothes <eos> saying "fare thee well today" <eos> thats not the promise that you gave to me <eos> when the first you lay on my breast <eos> you could make me believe with your lying tongue <eos> that the sun rose in the west <eos> go home go home to your fathers garden <eos> go home and weep your fill <eos> and think upon your own misfortune <eos> which you bought with your wanton will sandy denny <eos> love oh dont we know <eos> how can the river flow <eos> without you <eos> warming like the sand <eos> upon the land <eos> how can we doubt you <eos> dark to me the night <eos> and dim the morning light tomorrow <eos> how can we not see <eos> the simple melody of sorrow <eos> oh to be with you <eos> oh to see them through <eos> those days when we think you are gone <eos> they are so lonesome and so long <eos> what shall we do <eos> parting comes to soon <eos> my weary tune <eos> has lost its pleasure <eos> waiting for the time <eos> this lonely wine <eos> has lost its treasure <eos> dark to me the night <eos> and dim the morning light tomorrow <eos> how could i not see <eos>

its a long and a dusty road <eos> its a hard and a heavy load <eos> and the folks we meet aint always kind <eos> some are bad and some are good <eos> some have done the best they could <eos> some have tried to ease our troubling mind <eos> chorus <eos> and i cant help but wonder where im bound where im bound <eos> cant help but wonder where im bound <eos> i have traveled across this land <eos> just adoing the best i can <eos> tryin to find what i was meant to do <eos> and the faces that i see <eos> are as worried as can be <eos> looks like theyve been wonderin too <eos> chorus <eos> i had a buddy way back home <eos> but he started out to roam <eos> and i hear hes out by monterey <eos> and sometimes when ive had a few <eos> his voice comes singin through <eos> and im agoin out to see him some old day <eos> chorus <eos> if you see us passin by <eos> and you sit and you wonder why <eos> and you wish that you were a rambler too <eos> nail your shoes to the kitchen floor <eos> lace em up bar the door <eos> and thank the stars for the roof thats over you <eos> chorus <eos> and i cant help but wonder where im bound where im bound <eos> cant help but wonder where im bound well they called him super skier <eos> as he sat around the sundeck <eos> for he swore that he would never take a spill <eos> when they finally took him down <eos> they had to use three toboggans <eos> to carry all the pieces down the hill <eos> chorus <eos> he was comin down that slope <eos> goin ninety miles an hour <eos> when he caught an edge of his ski <eos> well his clothes they were fast <eos> but the slopes they were faster <eos> thats the last of super skier we shall see <eos> well he hollered "what the hell" <eos> as he put em parallel <eos> he figured there was nothing else to learn <eos> oh no <eos> and as he started on his way <eos> he was shoutin "andele" <eos> assuming that hed never have to turn <eos> well he was slippin down that slope <eos> goin ninety miles an hour <eos> when a mogul flipped him in the air <eos> his jumping form was fine <eos> until he ran into that pine <eos> and two onelegged skiers left from there <eos> chorus <eos> when he left that tree at last <eos> he was moving twice as fast <eos> both halves were skimming <eos> moguls like a feather <eos> he said "if i must be <eos> a split personality <eos> how can i ever keep my knees together" <eos> one ski was headed east <eos> and the other headed west <eos> cause both of them you see <eos> were running freer <eos> and folks up on little nell <eos> looked up scared as hell <eos> said "its a bird" "no its a <eos> plane" "its super skier" <eos> chorus <eos> now the moral of my story <eos> though my storys kinda gory <eos> is very simple even to a dope <eos> you buy the fastest clothes you can <eos> then talk skiing like a man <eos> but dont let people catch you on the slope <eos> chorus <eos> well he was comin down that slope <eos> goin ninety miles an hour <eos> when he caught an edge of his ski

love will you come with me <eos> my darling love will you come back home <eos> my darling love <eos> he was down at the market <eos> he drank and sang all day long <eos> when night came and he hadnt a penny in his pocket <eos> oh what a shame i didnt take the missus advice <eos> i met him at sunrise <eos> a charming healthy and lively young lad <eos> when he lifted his hat and spoke with a smile <eos> i fell in love with him thought it would never end <eos> my coat had buttons of silver <eos> and the best silk ribbons in the country <eos> golden chains and precious stones <eos> i truly enticed him with my glitter and gold <eos> no one knew from which part of the land he came <eos> he spoke nobly and with pleasant ease <eos> rumor had it that there was a lord in his family <eos> it wasnt long til i was engaged to him <eos> the bond is long and difficult to untie <eos> its much better to be sure of it <eos> it didnt take long til he broke my heart <eos> indeed this is not the story id prefer to be telling <eos> but then he went back down to the market <eos> and bought a ticket for a pound or two <eos> luck was on his side he won the lottery <eos> now well forever be living the good life <eos> this might mean that the link to this nobleman was a very distant one and that he therefore was not rich in fact quite poor so she instantly regrets her engagement to him <eos> "a leoga" means "alas" "n seo mo sciln" means "this is not my story" or anecdote and "" when placed after the sentence like this can just mean "oh" but it can also be a term of endearment then pertaining to "sciln" so the way i think it makes the most sense is if we take "mo sciln " to mean something like "my sweet story" ie the story that she wished she were telling now the kingdom of stone is on the wild and distant rolling hills <eos> solitary land stands alone and silence fought <eos> and look into the dark and endless skies <eos> and hear the clouds fly the angels sigh <eos> sweet water cool on a world it feels like paradise <eos> ten spirits more lay illusion on my mind <eos> and look into the dark and endless skies <eos> and hear the clouds fly the angels sigh <eos> its strange day in the country <eos> its a strange day in the country autumn leaves are falling round us <eos> time to gather all those many thoughts <eos> of all the things that might have been <eos> or gained at such a cost <eos> for some of us theres endless hoping <eos> for some of us craziness too <eos> holding on to better reasons <eos> works for me and you you know its true <eos> and when the stakes are higher <eos> never play with fire leave it alone <eos> i wandered through a country churchyard <eos> and wandered what kind of life they led <eos> walked into a castle ruin <eos> of gentry that had fled <eos> for some of them had endless hoping <eos> some of them crazy too <eos> holding on to better reasons <eos> well never truly know oh <eos> those trees will tumble down on a stormy day <eos> and those leaves will fade away fade away <eos> the autumn leaves are falling round us <eos> im here to gather all my many thoughts <eos> of all the things that might have been <eos> as the ground has

bough <eos> and as i walked out for my pleasure <eos> i saw a maid milking a cow <eos> her voice was so enchanting melodious <eos> left me quite unable to go <eos> my heart it was loaded with sorrow <eos> for the pretty maid milking her cow <eos> then to her i made my advances <eos> "good morrow most beautiful maid <eos> your beauty my heart so entrances" <eos> "pray sir do not banter" she said <eos> "im not such a rare precious jewel <eos> that i should enamour you so <eos> i am but a poor little milk girl" <eos> says the pretty maid milking her cow <eos> the indies afford no such jewel <eos> so bright so transparently clear <eos> i do not add things to my funeral <eos> consent but to know me my dear <eos> oh had i the lamp of aladdin <eos> or the wealth that gold mines can bestow

gait <eos> your hair the color of roses <eos> and your ringlets tightly plaited <eos> alas that were not married <eos> or on board ship sailing away <eos> the boys around here are <eos> laughing and getting bold <eos> and the people of the high straw <eos> are making of my brown girl <eos> if the king of spain would <eos> go abroad with his assembled men <eos> i would flatten grass and rank grass <eos> and i would be with my brown girl <eos> buying cows at the fair <eos> if i were and my brown girl <eos> go and come first love <eos> until we go over to gaothbearra <eos> until we separate from each other <eos> the tops of the branches and the swan <eos> from the waves <eos> that wont separate us <eos> and its only folly for you to put it <eos> i wrote a letter <eos> to my sweetheart and a sharp complaint <eos> she sent it back to me <eos> that her heart was inside me <eos> compose the artsswannoble person <eos> finer than silk or bird feathers <eos> heavy is my sigh <eos> when i think of being apart from her <eos> what i heard on sunday <eos> as conversation among the women <eos> that she was going to be married <eos> to a young man from the place <eos> sweetheart take my advice <eos> and this autumn stay as you are <eos> and dont tell anyone my love <eos> that you are my love the mist has cleared from muckish hill <eos> our parting coming nearer <eos> the last embrace the final touch <eos> with nothing more to say <eos> nothing more to say <eos> as silence fell around the bridge <eos> not a single word was spoken <eos> a bitter breeze a lonely stream <eos> echoed through the glen <eos> echoed through the glen <eos> droichead na ndeor <eos> agus droichead na gcaointe <eos> droichead na gcaointe <eos> agus droichead na ndeor <eos> memories fade with passing age <eos> in forlorn hope we wait for <eos> distant hills still haunt us now <eos> until the end of time <eos> until the end of time <eos> droichead na ndeor <eos> agus droichead na gcaointe <eos> droichead na gcaointe <eos> agus droichead na ndeor <eos> droichead na ndeor <eos> agus droichead na gcaointe <eos> droichead na gcaointe <eos> agus droichead na ndeor tis the last rose of summer <eos> left blooming alone <eos> all her lovely companions <eos> are faded and gone <eos> no flowerer of her kindred <eos> no rosebud is nigh <eos> to reflect back her blushes <eos> or give sigh for sigh <eos> ill not leave thee thou lone one <eos> to pine on the stem <eos> since the lovely are sleeping <eos> go sleep thou with them <eos> thus kindly i scatter <eos> thy leaves oer the bed <eos> where thy mates of the garden <eos> lie scentless and dead <eos> so soon may i follow <eos> when friendships decay <eos> and from loves shining circle <eos> the gems drop away <eos> when true hearts lie withered <eos> and fond ones are flown <eos> oh who would inhabit <eos> this bleak world alone at length did cross an albatross <eos> through the fog it came <eos> as if it had been a christian

<eos> its been right here all along <eos> so open your hands and grasp it <eos> ive made a horrible mistake <eos> i got the message too late <eos> and i knew it all along <eos> yet i let it come undone <eos> i hate that we arent watching the stars <eos> fall from the sky tonight <eos> what are you waiting for <eos> its been right here all along <eos> so open your hands and grasp it <eos> you said you never want to do it again <eos> but then i see you coming back around <eos> this broken parachute is holding out <eos> so cut the cord and let me hit the ground <eos> for just a moment everything made sense <eos> what are you waiting for <eos> its been right here all along <eos> so open your hands and grasp it someday i wont need this crutch that carries me <eos> and ill be so complete but these thoughts weigh me down <eos> cripple my hopes and dreams please just leave me be <eos> no stay and watch me beg and plead <eos> tell me what you need tell me everything <eos> am i only the air when you need to breathe <eos> save me from this long night alone and let me start again <eos> for when i wake up and see you lying next to me <eos> im blessed with a cure or a scent that never really fades <eos> its a vicious cycle it spins <eos> an eye for an eye not of the beholder it was in <eos> but things only get worse and i only meant well <eos> at least i thought i did <eos> am i only the air when you need to breathe <eos> am i only a window when you when you need to see <eos> it never really fades it never really fades away <eos> when all you know is nothing at all <eos> and the strings that hold you are bursting undone <eos> you cant pretend that its right when its completely wrong <eos> its wrong <eos> save me from this long night alone and let me start again <eos> for when i wake up and see you lying next to me <eos> im blessed with a cure or a scent that never really fades <eos> id hoped it never come to this <eos> a simple slap on the wrist surely would suffice enough <eos> and take me back to the start the dust and debris collapsed to the oceans and the seas <eos> it flashed and erupted the gods crippled with laughter <eos> and i was powerless to pretend that i wasnt in control <eos> of all the cities that glittered this was the city that glowed <eos> how could you choose water over wine <eos> when theres so much to spare <eos> save your breath tonights not done with you yet <eos> you cant understand the depths until all you know becomes unknown <eos> who are we if not the walls that surround us <eos> nothing is ever safe nothing is ever clear <eos> who are we if not the skin that binds to our bones <eos> nothing is ever safe nothing is ever clear <eos> cue the sun the siege has passed the tide has spoken and his words fall fast <eos> will i ever learn before i wash ashore <eos> or is this a scar that ive grown to adore <eos> who are we if not the walls that surround us <eos> nothing is ever safe nothing is ever clear <eos> who are we if not the skin that binds to our bones <eos> nothing is ever safe nothing is ever clear <eos> you cant resent the road that gave you something to lose <eos> were just the sum of the paths that we came through <eos> so hold your breath like its everything you have <eos> let it divulge and digest cause its running out too fast <eos> its like floating on an open door or watching waves from underwater <eos> so lets pretend that we lets pretend that we understand the depths <eos> of whats buried in our chests <eos> what weve evolved to hide behind the sternum or is it pride <eos> its a power you cant ignore spend a lifetime searching for <eos> but will we ever know cant you see what ive done to you <eos> youre hopelessly endlessly intoxicated by this aerial view <eos> you know this isnt what i want but the spark of life i see in you <eos> then ignites in me and takes me away to a better place <eos> its all partly consequent <eos> medicate in self defence <eos> gone again in a matter of breaths <eos> its all in my head <eos> and then im laid back down again <eos> and the lights begin to bend <eos> hear the whisper in my hear <eos> its all in my head <eos> dont you say im totally indifferent to either or either way <eos> ive tried to say communicate your holy words but they came to late <eos> cant you see what youve done to me <eos> im hopelessly endlessly intoxicated by this reality <eos> its in my head <eos> would you say you dont see me <eos> would you say you dont need me <eos> in the end lets pretend all i did was make it easy <eos> but suddenly im awake <eos> suddenly suddenly im awake im awake this kingdom comes at a price <eos> and weve overpaid with goodbyes <eos> buyer beware if weve gained your trust <eos> attention brings out the best and worst in <eos> your attention brings out the best and worst in us <eos> its like a wedding and a funeral on the same day <eos> were singing songs that weve written at our own wake <eos> its like were waiting for a mountain to fade <eos> were falling back back into our old ways <eos> you know who i am i know you are <eos> an atom bomb a dying star <eos> so heres one for all of you <eos> heres one for everything we didnt do <eos> too old to die young <eos> too close not to see this through <eos> so heres one for all of you <eos> how can you know what you want <eos> but not what to do <eos> how can you live a life that wasnt meant for you <eos> so heres one for all of you <eos> heres one for everything we didnt do <eos> too old to die young <eos> too close not to see this through <eos> so heres

been on her own for a long and lonely year <eos> living for his letters from far away vietnam <eos> and dreading the official telegram <eos> so she was waiting at the station when his train came rolling in <eos> she ached with anticipation of holding him again <eos> and suddenly he was standing there in his crumpled uniform <eos> in a heartbeat she was in his arms <eos> welcome home boys welcome home <eos> dont you know youve been gone too long <eos> did you wonder over there <eos> when you were tired when you were scared <eos> if your country really cared welcome home <eos> when a nation goes to war everyones a casualty <eos> some are maimed and scarred most have wounds you cannot see <eos> so in place of the man that she had known <eos> annie found instead a sick and troubled stranger in her bed <eos> but she was stubborn she was lovin so she stayed all through the years <eos> the hard times and the drinking the nightmares and the tears <eos> for where hate is muddy quicksand love is tempered steel <eos> annie waited for his wounds to heal <eos> welcome home boys welcome home <eos> dont you know youve been gone too long <eos> were just so glad that youre alive <eos> and only you will wonder why <eos> you lived when others died welcome home <eos> so on a sunny sydney morning i heard old war drums beat <eos> and watched the boys come marching down the city street <eos> to claim their place in the nations heart <eos> that their blood and pain had earned <eos> a nation that rejoiced in their return <eos> and if the day helped to heal some wounds is a matter of debate <eos> for some it had come none too soon for others far too late <eos> but i found myself hoping as the boys went marching past <eos> that for them the war was over at last <eos> welcome home boys welcome home <eos> dont you know youve been gone too long <eos> what you went through in vietnam we cant begin to understand <eos> but to each and every man welcome home <eos> welcome home boys welcome home <eos> dont you know youve been gone too long <eos> may the years bring you release as the memories decrease <eos> may you find some kind of peace welcome home <eos> may you find some kind of peace welcome home <eos> <eos> notes <eos> anzac day parade anzac day is australias version of <eos> memorial day in the us and canada "the sign" <eos> eric bogle <eos> in the summer of last year in a city far from here <eos> that stands on the shores of the fair pacific sea <eos> i walked its pleasant streets no view in mind no one to meet <eos> content to wander where my aimless feet led me <eos> a few streets from my hotel i passed an old stone wall <eos> where three words had been scrawled by an unknown hand <eos> when i read them i stopped dead in disbelief i shook my head <eos> for the words on that wall read "free bobby sands" <eos> as the sun began to fall and the day began to die <eos> thought i heard the wild geese call from a dark and empty sky <eos> for long minutes i stood there in that busy thoroughfare <eos> while the past rose sharp and clear in my minds eye <eos> i saw it all again the passion hate and pain <eos> the indifference and the shame as a young man died <eos> but it was all so long ago and who now cares or knows <eos> why bobby sands chose his lonely death <eos> but to the one who wrote that sign <eos> it seems that bobbys light still shines <eos> the words rang from another time <eos> but the paint was fresh <eos> as the sun began to fall and the day began to die <eos> thought i heard the wild geese call from a dark and empty sky <eos> so i went down to the sea to let its wild song comfort me <eos> but my thoughts would not let me be and unchecked they ran <eos> through my future present and past <eos> not for the first time nor the last <eos> i heard them ask "could you be the kind of man <eos> who would gladly sacrifice everything even life <eos> and put no price on a cause or an ideal" <eos> no answer echoed in my heart so i turned and i walked back <eos> through the twilights deepening dark to my hotel <eos> <eos> historical note <eos> bobby sands mp was imprisoned in under criminal charges <eos> stemming from his alleged involvement in ira terrorist activities <eos> in ulster province northern ireland mr sands along with <eos> other alleged ira members in prison awaiting trial went <eos> on a hunger strike to protest inhumane conditions in the prison and to <eos> have the ira members reclassified as "political prisoners" <eos> the hunger strike lasted more than days resulting in the deaths <eos> of many of the prisoners of which mr sands was the first to succumb <eos> auckland new zealand "mirrors" <eos> eric bogle <eos> children are born with trust in their eyes <eos> its the first

billy is a tin often an old used fruit tin or other steel container <eos> used to boil water to make tea often they have a piece of wire <eos> across their top used as a handle whereupon after the water is boiling <eos> one holds the wire places the desired amount of tea leaves in said <eos> water stands up and swings the whole billy in a circular motion <eos> vigorously in order to force the tea leaves to the bottom of the tin a <eos> rather nice touch is to crush a coolibah leaf into the water too giving <eos> the tea a hint of eucalyptus <eos> jumbuck <eos> a sheep usually refers to a

often wealthy <eos> landowners from britain who could afford the prices the government was <eos> asking there were also freehold selections free for the taking all you <eos> had to do was sign on the dotted line made available to anyone who <eos> would try to exploit the land but the freehold lots tended to be poorer <eos> land where it was a battle to earn to living squatters became fairly <eos> wealthy from their allocations even taking over freehold selections in <eos> the process of expanding their lots reflected in the fact that this one <eos> is riding on his thoroughbred horse <eos> troopers <eos> the troopers are law enforcement the squatter would have called <eos> them in because the swagman has stolen a sheep from the squatters property <eos> matilda <eos> given the lonely

when i was a young man i carried me pack and i lived the free life of a rover <eos> from the murrays green basin to the dusty outback well i waltzed my matilda all over <eos> then in my country said son its time you stopped rambling theres work to be done <eos> so they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun and they marched me away to the war <eos> and the band played waltzing matilda as the ship pulled away from the quay <eos> and amidst all the cheers the flagwaving and tears we sailed off for gallipoli <eos> and how well i remember that terrible day how our blood stained the sand and the water <eos> and of how in that hell that they called suvla bay we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter <eos> johnny turk he was waiting hed primed himself well he showerd us with bullets <eos> and he rained us with shell and in five minutes flat hed blown us all to hell <eos> nearly blew us right back to australia <eos> but the band played waltzing matilda when we stopped to bury our slain <eos> we buried ours and the turks buried theirs then we started all over again <eos> and those that were left well we tried to survive in that mad world of blood death and fire <eos> and for ten weary weeks i kept myself alive though around me the corpses piled higher <eos> then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head and when i woke up in my hospital bed <eos> and saw what it had done well i wished i was dead never knew there was worse things than dyin <eos> for ill go no more waltzing matilda all around the green bush far and free <eos> to hump tent and pegs a man needs both legsno more waltzing matilda for me <eos> so they gathered the crippled the wounded the maimed and they shipped us back home to australia <eos> the legless the armless the blind the insane those proud wounded heroes of suvla <eos> and as our ship pulled into circular quay i looked at the place where me legs used to be <eos> and thanked christ there was nobody waiting for me to grieve to mourn and to pity <eos> but the band played waltzing matilda as they carried us down the gangway <eos> but nobody cheered they just stood and stared then they turned all their faces away <eos> and so now every april i sit on me porch and i watch the parades pass before me <eos> and i see my old comrades how proudly they march reviving old dreams of past glories <eos> and the old men march slowly old bones stiff and sore theyre tired old heroes from a forgotten war <eos> and the young people ask what are they marching for and i ask myself the same question <eos> but the band plays waltzing matilda and the old men still answer the call <eos> but as year follows year more old men disappear someday no one will march there at all <eos> waltzing matilda waltzing matilda wholl come awaltzing matilda with me <eos> and their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong wholl come awaltzing matilda with me <eos> <eos> notes <eos> "matilda" the backpack and associated gear used by livestock drovers

brackish water <eos> historical note <eos> the gallipoli campaign april january <eos> a major land and sea operation of world war i in which <eos> british french australian and new zealand forces <eos> unsuccessfully attempted an invasion of turkey <eos> the action was confined to the dardanelles strait <eos> and the tip of the gallipoli gelibolu peninsula near <eos> istanbul the purpose of the campaign devised by british <eos> munitions minister david lloyd george first lord of the <eos> admiralty winston churchill general herbert h kitchener <eos> and admiral sackville h carden was to open up a new <eos> theater of war as an alternative to the stalemate in <eos> france to relieve turkish pressure on russian forces <eos> in the caucasus and by gaining control of istanbul <eos> and the straits to provide a direct link with russia <eos> via the black sea this campaign is also significant <eos> for australians in that it marked the first time a major <eos> australian military force was commanded by australian <eos> instead of english officers <eos> what initially was to be exclusively a naval operation <eos> failed in february when several british and french <eos> ships were damaged by floating mines a land invasion was <eos> then decided on but it was not begun until late april <eos> an amphibious landing at that time was met with heavy <eos> resistance by the turks excessive caution and timorous <eos> leadership by the british commander sir ian hamilton <eos> resulted in several lost initiatives little headway <eos> was made beyond the several beachheads in early august <eos> after three months of stalemate and stagnation on the <eos> beaches a new major offensive was begun once again <eos> however the excessive caution and indifferent leadership <eos> of the british command offset the effect of heavy <eos> reinforcements the turkish forces on the other hand were <eos> inspired by the leadership of mustafa kemal kemal atatã¼rk <eos> later president of turkey and the skill of their german <eos> commander otto liman von sanders after a few more months <eos> of stalemate hamilton was replaced by sir charles monro <eos> who was sent to evaluate the situation monro recommended <eos> evacuation and the allied forces were withdrawn in december <eos> and january british casualties were out of <eos> the french sustained a rate of out of turkish <eos> to out of the fiasco badly <eos> stained the reputations of churchill hamilton and kitchener <eos> despite its overall failure however the gallipoli campaign <eos> weakened the turks enough to facilitate the british seizure <eos> of palestine in the action also distracted the germans <eos> from a plan they had in to begin another offensive in france "ibrahim" <eos> eric bogle <eos> album the colour of dreams <eos> hey ibrahim tell me what do you think of australia <eos> do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder <eos> as the sky catches fire and the trees and the mountains change colour <eos> but i guess the view from this side of the barbedwires much better <eos> so ibrahim can you tell me why did you come here <eos> what dream were you chasing and what did you hope to find here <eos> did you flee from your own native land because your life was in danger <eos> or were the reasons much more mundane just poverty and hunger <eos> wrong path wrong choice wrong creed wrong culture <eos> wrong place wrong time wrong dream and wrong colour <eos> you see ibrahim theres something ive been meaning to tell you <eos> being hungry and poor bestows no special status upon you <eos> we wont send you back if you can prove theyd imprison or kill you <eos> but if youre just going back home to starve im afraid we cant help you <eos> you see ibrahim youve become a bit of a problem <eos> this worlds full of refugees fleeing poverty war and oppression <eos> so to take in queuejumpers like you well its out of the question <eos> it would give the worlds hungry and poor the wrong impression <eos> wrong path wrong choice wrong creed wrong culture <eos> wrong place wrong time wrong dream and wrong colour <eos> im afraid ibrahim its time to be totally candid <eos> you had buckleys chance right from the moment you landed <eos> already to many a threat and a danger you were branded <eos> and all because you follow the prophet mohammed <eos> you didnt count ibrahim on political opportunism <eos> our leaders knew that to many australians the very word "muslim" <eos> meant alquaeda hammas the taliban and terrorism <eos> and thats why you and your family are locked up in prison <eos> wrong path wrong choice wrong creed wrong culture <eos> wrong place wrong time wrong dream and wrong colour <eos> so ibrahim tell me what do you think of australia <eos> do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder <eos> as the sky catches fire and the trees and the mountains change colour <eos> but i guess the view from this side of the barbedwires much better <eos> yes i guess the view from this side of the barbedwires much better <eos> <eos> note <eos> "buckleys chance" australian colloquialism meaning "no chance whatsoever" <eos> the phrase came into use in

<eos> cockie australian smallscale family farmer <eos> gin "jen" an australian aboriginal woman <eos> the term is nowadays considered to be derogatory "something of value" <eos> eric bogle <eos> i can see the southern cross tonight <eos> while here below bathed in its light <eos> the dreamtime land safe snug and tight is sleeping <eos> wrapped in complacency and contentedness <eos> no discordant sounds disturb our rest <eos> while the gentle souls weve dispossesed are weeping <eos> we took it all by the gun and the sword <eos> by the right of our race and in the name of our god <eos> though as outcasts ourselves transported condemned <eos> none knew better than we the injustice of men <eos> we took it all in our hunger and need <eos> enslaved by our past and consumed by our greed <eos> and left them to beg for the scraps at our door <eos> while we called them drunkards and wasters and whores <eos> theyve been drowning drowning in their tears <eos> for the last two hundread years <eos> from englands new jerusalem <eos> to the dreamtime land the tall ships came <eos> with human cattle in convict chains to bind them <eos> in the grim fight just to stay alive <eos> dreams must struggle to survive <eos> few could see the glittring prize before them <eos> we had it all in the palm of our hand <eos> a new hope a new dream a new life a new land <eos> one last chance to break from the chains of the past <eos> to build something of value build something to last <eos> this ancient land was a vast empty page <eos> waiting for the great writers of a brand new age <eos> the future was ours to protect or profane <eos> a paradise lost a paradise gained <eos> now tell me is paradise here <eos> after two hundred years <eos> so now beneath the southern cross <eos> its time to tally up the cost <eos> of what weve gained and what weve lost forever <eos> though much has gone we cant replace <eos> those of us who love this place <eos> together now must turn and face the future <eos> so heres to us all were frail humankind <eos> who wander through life mostly helpless and blind <eos> to our courage and cowardice our humor and pain <eos> our hundred steps forward ninetynine back again <eos> yes heres to us all the wise and the fools <eos> the indifferent the caring the kind and the cruel <eos> as we march to the beat of an uncertain drum <eos> stumbling towards what we may yet become <eos> towards the brave new frontiers <eos> of the next two hundred years wee dark engine room <eos> g c g c g g c f g c c g c f c g c g c f c f c <eos> in that wee dark engine room <eos> where the chill seeps through your soul <eos> how we huddled round that wee pot stove <eos> that burned oily rags and coal <eos> c f c g g <eos> how the winter blizzards blow and the whaling fleets at rest <eos> tucked in leigh harbors sheltered bay safely anchored ten abreast <eos> the whalers at their stations as from shed to shed they go <eos> carry little bags of coal with them and a little iron stove <eos> chorus <eos> the fireman paddy worked with me on the engine stiff and cold <eos> a stranger to the truth was he theres not a lie he hasnt told <eos> and he boasted of his gold mine and of all the hearts hed won <eos> and his bonny sense of humor shone just like a ray of sun <eos> chorus <eos> then one day we saw the sun and factory ships return <eos> meet your old friends sing a song hope the season wont be long <eos> then homeward bound when its over well leave this icy hold <eos> but i always will remember that little iron stove <eos> chorus <eos> <eos> words and music by eric bogle <eos> recorded by ed trickett on "the ways of man" fsi copyright <eos> "many songs are sung about whaling and whalers almost all describe <eos> a voyage or the catch of the whale or some of the men and their <eos> needs this song written by eric bogle describes the bone <eos> chilling existance of the men who stayed with the ships when they <eos> were laid up for the winter doing routine maintenance and engine <eos> overhaul in the clammy unheated holds of the engine rooms" et <eos> filename enginrm <eos> dc <eos> document boundary theyll be wondering how this all came about <eos> and silly rumors will fly around this little town <eos> but i dont care i know its in the air <eos> how much i adore you <eos> ive been singing about water <eos> without a second foot on dry ground <eos> you make swimming so easy im gonna drown <eos> in your capping blues and greens <eos> i mean who gets to feel this way <eos> but its a quiet revolution in the way that you love me <eos> you set the sky high above me <eos> and the heart can travel given the right set of wings <eos> you can see everything <eos> its a quick turn the corner back into prolific <eos> you take the summer off jotting things down <eos> that you hope will come back to ya <eos> its aint easy when youre the only thing thats on my mind <eos> its the kindest storm blowing in a bigger love i had first realized the shape i was in <eos> after six years in uniform in the standing din <eos> i signed in at eighteen for a college degree <eos> recruiting out of high school into opportunity <eos> id always equated my love for my land <eos> with the loyalty of the army but now i understand <eos> im from a small town i knew quiet streets <eos> there was a market where people often meet <eos> i built my home there me and my family <eos> these are the loneliest days ive seen <eos> my soldiers are marching according to rank <eos> they have occupied the borderlines outside the west bank <eos> im relieving my attention on a bloody red machine <eos> a conscientious citizen for the democratic regime <eos> this kind of struggles not one to go alone <eos> so im joining the opposition but im never going home i always wonder where you came from <eos> and you always say mars <eos> i noticed one day my life was missing something <eos> and then there you are <eos> in your shiny martian suit <eos> with a ship by your side <eos> i was wearing my heart on my sleeve <eos> you were wearing a star <eos> i cant help but feel the luckiest <eos> of anyone here <eos> was it so beautiful on your planet <eos> that you wanted me there <eos> before you know it <eos> were in it one year deep <eos> tell me why do you want <eos> to go out living in disguise <eos> you always show me love with open arms <eos> and i always give in <eos> i would have charmed you back from china <eos> or from the pisces fin <eos> and how i am swept away <eos> by your mission to change the world <eos> and i know that youve changed <eos> one world here for sure <eos> before you know it <eos> were in it two years deep <eos> and i know that youve changed <eos> one world here for sure yesterday the circus left town in a suitcase <eos> rimmed with little key chain hearts <eos> and they tore those giant tents down <eos> lions in the pouring rain <eos> and the birds in the pouring rain <eos> ohm but my heart belongs to the bearded woman <eos> who had a glory bound lonely gaze <eos> she used to fit her head <eos> inside an elephants mouth <eos> with some kind of solitude grace <eos> when you find it oh you better use it up <eos> you better hold on to it <eos> like its an answer to your prayers <eos> spring is coming early this year you can tell <eos> cause everybodys got their old jobs back <eos> no one stays too long around here <eos> they left circles in the wide back fields <eos> and the farmers tried to cover up the scars <eos> you can still run your hands over soft black earth <eos> and wonder where they are <eos> oh but my son left for the fields today <eos> hes a fourth generation <eos> works good with his hands <eos> got his mothers cheeks and a big brass heart <eos> and boy he loves to work that land <eos> out on the streets in my new city <eos> you can see where shadows <eos> make prints on the pavement <eos> they know when the salvation army truck <eos> comes around <eos> lions in the pouring rain <eos> and theyre birds in the pouring rain <eos> they hold their cups <eos> out by the side of the circus tent doors <eos> between the bank and the hmv <eos> but you never hear <eos> the rattle on a rich mans coat <eos> whos got it locked up with a key close the curtains and lock the doors <eos> shut down my day i wont answer anymore <eos> ive got things on my mind and troubles to bare <eos> love is cruel love is kind and its everywhere <eos> you found me overwhelmed <eos> and clinging to my knees <eos> you may not know it babe <eos> but youve been helping me <eos> ive been in deep waters <eos> searching for some change <eos> ive got dreams like the weather <eos> and habits just as strange <eos> oh oh oh <eos> you dont find it in writing <eos> when the heart does so much talking <eos> that the dialogs becomes a way of rhyme <eos> we could go on weighing <eos> our peace in good measures <eos> we still would have run out of time <eos> so dont weigh your body down <eos> if you wanna shout it out loud <eos> i will be your ears <eos> and i would tell you im so proud <eos> of our love up to the last <eos> how it all flipped by so fast <eos> give us both chance to rise <eos> after a fall like this <eos> oh oh oh <eos> i wish you all that you could wish for <eos> all that you can hold <eos> but this love is deeper waters <eos> to no mold <eos> open your arms again in time <eos> you will find comfort there <eos> love is cruel love is kind <eos> and its everywhere the plot gets thicker and it always goes astray <eos> youre never holding in your hands a particular play <eos> youre not satisfied with the taste or smell <eos> and its not what you ordered well <eos> theres a good chance some body else has got it made <eos> well theres trouble where you seek it <eos> you see it in store windows <eos> and the box is twice as big as the item <eos> theres a spotlight shining from the corner both night and day <eos> some gather round and paw the glass <eos> others who know better pass <eos> and they whisper to themselves theyll never find their way <eos> with stars in their eyes theyll never find their way <eos> theres trouble where you seek it <eos> you dont have to go sneaking around <eos> to find theyve found you out by now <eos> theres trouble where you seek it deep love hell you know trouble so well <eos> you dont have a pattern and you never can tell <eos> you are a yellow caution light and a yield sign <eos> and im building tall fences to protect this heart of mine <eos> was it so much difficulty cutting that glass <eos> you didnt think it would last <eos> and after twentytwo years <eos> im not doing so bad at all <eos> i guess it dont matter if the jokes on me <eos> you have me at your beck and call <eos> and to tell you the truth <eos> i really dont mind at all <eos> change change change <eos> theres a different address every time <eos> and ive got plenty of practice <eos> and i know you dont mind <eos> im home in the country or here in the park <eos> i stumble where ever you land <eos> have mercy on my timing its out of my hands <eos> you want the world on a whim and the sky below <eos> you really walk the line <eos> but i bet you miss it when every things fine <eos> i guess it dont matter if the jokes on me <eos> you have me at your beck and call <eos> and to tell you the truth i really dont mind at all <eos> what would i ever do if you left me here alone <eos> i would need a come back to a dial tone i could not stay sleeping oh my mind would not allow <eos> and suddenly all these thoughts on life crept into me somehow <eos> the sun has barely risen to lay aside another night <eos> and its here i settle softly into every word i write <eos> maybe im just counting up my sheep too late <eos> but i just let them run beyond the fence <eos> what good are guards that wouldnt give such pleasure <eos> i think ill have a morning one that starts out with a laugh <eos> in the hopes that it would spread out equal on behalf <eos> of an unforgiving measure oh where find time just ticks away <eos> to let the simple things bring you closer in a simple way what kind of move is the best thing <eos> for leaving you in the i dont know <eos> you can leave the best of a cool nest <eos> but theres no master plan when you go <eos> you hear the swearing and the laughter <eos> smoke coming in from the neighbors next door <eos> my christina had the toughest set of lungs <eos> she could out sing anyone <eos> shed have them up on the small floor dancing <eos> anyone knew anyone <eos> i hate to be leaving in the middle of this <eos> what can i say but <eos> this city is chorded theres rhythm in the traffic <eos> spokes in the wheels wherever you go <eos> im just one exception to be sitting here <eos> trying to carve out some kind of a home <eos> everyone around here lets their cats loose <eos> to control the mice <eos> its the kind of neighborhood with a few broken down houses <eos> but its kinda nice <eos> going through photos of places youve been <eos> the places you part <eos> its the packing and the moving that really holds on <eos> to the rungs of a lonely heart <eos> just when you think its over <eos> something new begins <eos> somewhere in the grander scheme of scheming <eos> just when you think youre stepping out <eos> thats when youre stepping in <eos> it leaves you open windowed and ever dreaming bring down the rain bring out the ghosts <eos> its twentyfive degrees out on the west coast <eos> every things in bloom there and i dont care <eos> ive been thinking about leaving too <eos> you pack as little as you can cause thats what you do <eos> you put everything in storage and give the dog to mom <eos> she wouldnt mind theres a big back field <eos> a long time ago they stopped turning yield <eos> you should see the view there from up on the hill <eos> i fell in love with the train last week and everyone there <eos> i got the scent of everyones laughter in my hair <eos> we watched the landscapes click by hell i was the engineer <eos> i saw the country from the dome car and i was outta here <eos> by night we traveled slow by day we went fast <eos> and no one checked to see where we were on the map <eos> you knew you hit the prairies and you knew why <eos> you take a deep breath and hold it in <eos> and every deep breath seems to quiet the din <eos> you forget about the time zones there are none out there <eos> home for the reckless home for the race <eos> its home for a moment of time and space <eos> you lose all your sleep when the playing is done <eos> you learn the rails and youre learning on the tracks <eos> someone tells a story of an old steam back <eos> and a village comes together seven coaches long nu lyser ã¤ngarna av sommarns alla blommor <eos> nu surrar bin och fã¥glar sjunger ã¶verallt <eos> nu stryker vinden genom trã¤dens hã¶ga kronor <eos> men i min trã¤dgã¥rd ã¤r det visset mã¶rkt och kallt <eos> hã¤r ã¤r det risigt och fã¶rvuxet fult och snã¥rigt <eos> och lika hopplã¶st grã¥tt och trist som i mitt brã¶st <eos> dã¤rute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter <eos> dã¤r ã¤r det sommar men hã¤r inne ã¤r det hã¶st <eos> jag levde lycklig hã¤r med dig och mina katter <eos> ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frã¤lst <eos> fã¶rsonad med min karaktã¤r fã¶r jag har aldrig <eos> fã¶rmott att sã¤ga nej till nã¥gonting som helst <eos> och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra <eos> och levat livet tills jag krossades en dag <eos> det bã¶rja med att du bedrog mig med en annan <eos> en som du sa var mycket finare ã¤n jag <eos> vã¥rt grã¤l tog veckor ropen blandades med grã¥ten <eos> och jag blev grundligt jã¤mfã¶rd med din fina vã¤n <eos> tills du bekã¤nde att hon givit dig pã¥ bã¥ten <eos> dã¥ blev det dã¶dstyst hã¤r i trã¤dgã¥rden igen <eos> ifrã¥n den stunden var den kvinnan dubbelt hatad <eos> hon hade lekt med dig med oss ett litet slag <eos> och ja jag kã¤nde det som ã¤ven jag var ratad <eos> jag ville slã¥ss och gick mot mitt livs nederlag <eos> jag kom med hammaren beredd under min kappa <eos> nã¤r hon kom ut i sidenpumps och sa god dag <eos> kom in och slã¥ dig ner en stund sã¥ fã¥r vi prata <eos> jag bara stammade nu minns jag inte vad <eos> och jag blev bjuden pã¥ likã¶r och cigarriller <eos> och kunde inte fã¥ mig till att sã¤ga nej <eos> och nã¤r vi skiljdes var vi bã¤stisar och bundis <eos> och jag tog saker som du glã¶mt med hem till dig ill be the chorus youll be the verse <eos> well live in a forrest of beautiful words <eos> ill be the strings youll be the keys <eos> together well find all the harmonies <eos> all were got is all we have to give away <eos> so what i have not i fill in with what you got <eos> and well be okay <eos> take yours and mine well combine and well have everything

alright now <eos> gonna break down the breakdown <eos> move from where we stand <eos> see what we dont want to see <eos> i love you <eos> you love me <eos> oh but lately <eos> somethings wearing on me <eos> ive been growing <eos> ive been changing <eos> and seems like youre barely moving <eos> chorus <eos> there is nothing we can do to get past this <eos> nothing you could say <eos> baby please dont fret <eos> our time has moved passed us <eos> i love you <eos> you love me <eos> is it possible we love differently <eos> you need me but i need to <eos> feel strong baby without you <eos> chorus all by yourself alone at night thinking to myself i know you wanna cry let me tell you nothings the same i can feel it deep inside the devils driven you away <eos> fade away forget everything fade away forget everything <eos> my mind wants to play life seems meaningless i must say and i know its wrong to feel this way for so damn long you can numb my brain if you can cure my pain afraid to lose dont wanna fight i just might <eos> fade away forget everything fade away forget everything <eos> but you might see what lies within me and you might believe that all is meant to be why why should you and i <eos> fade away forget everything fade away forget everything its been years its been so long what can i say <eos> now youre gone youve slipped away <eos> in my life i would have given every breath to you <eos> did you care for me did you love me too <eos> have mercy on me have mercy on me <eos> time will be the day maybe then my fear of dismay <eos> will go away it wont last long and when i see your face when its my time to go will you wait beside the gate to hold me and yes i know yes you know it hurts me <eos> have mercy on me have mercy on me <eos> iv been waiting for the sun to shine to pull back on me and to you i will never say goodbye youll be with me forever by my side <eos> have mercy on me have mercy on me this may come as a surprise <eos> but ive got xray eyes <eos> and i can see the skull <eos> beneath the skin <eos> though you do not realize <eos> i can read whats in your mind <eos> and i know youre not so <eos> attached to him <eos> celestine dont lie to me <eos> celestine dont lie dont lie <eos> you may not understand <eos> i dont need to lay on hands <eos> i already know exactly <eos> how you feel <eos> you dont have to say a word <eos> its your heatbeat i have heard <eos> getting louder now across <eos> the space between <eos> i know what youre thinking <eos> so you dont have to say <eos> stranger things can happen <eos> they happen every day <eos> ive got special information <eos> i dont need to be told <eos> but i need insight into your soul i live for the stuff that matters <eos> and i build on the things i know <eos> but she turns my world upsidedown <eos> get a paper hat for a crown <eos> im a backward nowhere shanty town <eos> in a whirlwind when shes around <eos> i dont trust any easy answers <eos> and i take every chance i can <eos> but she turns my world upside down <eos> get a paper hat for a crown <eos> im a backward nowhere shanty town <eos> in a whirlwind when shes around <eos> and im on the floor <eos> looking at the ceiling <eos> and it makes me think <eos> but i like the feeling <eos> i found what you all are after <eos> and i know im a wanted man <eos> but she turns <eos> and she turns <eos> but she turns my world upsidedown <eos> get a paper hat for a crown <eos> im a backwards nowhere shanty town <eos> in a whirlwind when shes around <eos> oh whirlwind when its dark outside and youre all alone <eos> and your peace of mind is all gone <eos> when duty calls and he takes the car <eos> and you feel the shakes coming on <eos> reach for me when the gold starts to rust <eos> when your colours run will you call <eos> reach for me when the threads come undone <eos> when your cover slips and you fall <eos> will you reach for me <eos> when your glass is dry and youre out of luck <eos> and theres no respite you can see <eos> if that great big house with so many rooms <eos> is a useless thing you dont need when the day breaks and falls apart <eos> thats my fanfare my calling card <eos> a run of bad luck darkness at noon <eos> i dont need the password to get to you <eos> im a venus hunter <eos> from another world <eos> ten thousand years <eos> since ive seen a girl <eos> burning petrol in my brain <eos> what i called love you call insane <eos> some try wishing upon a star <eos> some try running they dont get far <eos> im a venus hunter <eos> from another world <eos> ten thousand years <eos> since ive seen a girl hold it tight <eos> if you can <eos> one little slip <eos> and its gone <eos> from your hands <eos> she gave in silver <eos> but i offered her <eos> mercury <eos> that last drop <eos> how it shines <eos> cold to the lips <eos> but it wont <eos> taste like wine <eos> she gave in silver <eos> but i offered her <eos> mercury listen <eos> to the voice that calls <eos> from the edge of sleep <eos> down the hall <eos> no breath no lying lips <eos> no heartbeat no fingertips <eos> shes invisible <eos> does not exist <eos> anymore <eos> shes invisible <eos> crossed off my list <eos> a closed door <eos> nothing <eos> breaks the silence <eos> all the waiting hours <eos> of the night <eos> no sight no sound or shape <eos> but imagination <eos> incinerates <eos> invisible <eos> shes invisible <eos> look out sun is gone moon is a halo <eos> candle stars flicker and fade <eos> in the dark were getting closer <eos> feel the world falling away <eos> transport of delight <eos> drive me out of my mind <eos> transport of delight <eos> dont look back <eos> leave this world behind <eos> branches reach up to the heavens <eos> shadows dance on your pale curves <eos> im going down to the oasis <eos> start again when i return <eos> dont look back <eos> come on now <eos> hold on tight <eos> leave this world behind struck by the sight <eos> i suppose i was hypnotized <eos> i took a hint <eos> and built it all up in my mind <eos> i thought we were dealing <eos> in diamonds and pearls <eos> now the sparkle is gone <eos> and the outline is blurred <eos> ice sculpture melts <eos> but i wont forget you girl <eos> i looked at my watch <eos> then i looked in your eyes <eos> some vague design <eos> started to crystallize <eos> i thought that we had <eos> all the time in the world <eos> but the colours have run <eos> and the weather has turned <eos> ice sculpture melts <eos> but i wont forget you girl cant tell the end from the start <eos> but i know how it will be <eos> im gonna hijack your heart <eos> youll belong to me <eos> the furthest thing from your mind <eos> but you cant see what i see <eos> sugar i prophesy <eos> you will turn to me yeah <eos> so you think youre immune <eos> well you believe what you please <eos> cause when i call the tune <eos> you will never be free <eos> youll belong to me i must have had a nightmare <eos> cause im not seeing straight <eos> the shadows creep and slide <eos> the strangest thoughts <eos> go through my head <eos> outside the traffic lights <eos> they change from green to red <eos> and as my heart applies the brakes <eos> i reach across the bed <eos> i was in a dream <eos> you were by my side <eos> warmer than the sun <eos> then the picture changed <eos> began to fade away <eos> turned and you were gone <eos> sleepwalking <eos> could that be somebody <eos> standing on the stairs <eos> i cant ask you <eos> i cant find you anywhere <eos> so why are you out walking <eos> walking in my sleep <eos> and what goes through your mind <eos> each time you lie between the sheets when i sunk <eos> into the sea <eos> when you saw <eos> what i did to me <eos> like i could fall to my knees <eos> and worry about everything <eos> it might hurt <eos> but ill be <eos> on my way to better things <eos> you dont want <eos> what i need <eos> the veil lifts my prophecy <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna be <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna see <eos> well youre a beautiful woman <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> the one with ruby seams <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman <eos> and in a blur <eos> there seemed to be <eos> only downward <eos> plummeting <eos> to the blackness of my e <eos> go crushed from reality <eos> and even though <eos> i know these things <eos> the forces still arrested me <eos> threw me down <eos> made me think <eos> ill never be <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna be <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna see <eos> well youre a beautiful woman <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> the one with ruby seams <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman <eos> under the water lies the core <eos> the mother that births what comes to shore <eos> steeped in the womb until its born <eos> the boiling fire creates the storm <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna be <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman <eos> youre the one i wanna see <eos> well youre a beautiful woman <eos> a beautiful woman <eos> the one with ruby seams <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman <eos> beautiful woman beautiful woman i must admit when she comes <eos> youll be enticed by the surreal <eos> the things shell show you in that world <eos> will be the things that you cant erase <eos> if you tried <eos> believe me i tried <eos> take my word <eos> youre better off <eos> never knowing the upside of weightlessness <eos> i must admit when she leaves <eos> youd follow her straight into hell <eos> the things shell show you in that world <eos> will be the things that you cant erase <eos> if you tried <eos> believe me i tried <eos> take my word <eos> youre better off <eos> never knowing the upside of weightlessness <eos> youll spend your life in a world where the sun rides the horizon <eos> but never falls below <eos> in a place where youre eyes grow heavy <eos> but she wont let them close reading back on the lines <eos> second guessing all my words <eos> how do i apologize for ruining someones life besides my own <eos> regrets on the back of the boat <eos> i guess im all out of time <eos> looking for a treasure <eos> that i knew id never find <eos> i know its not what we planned <eos> but i had to take a chance <eos> and i failed <eos> take this note <eos> tear it to pieces <eos> if i let you down again <eos> tie myself to the tide <eos> sacrificing all i had <eos> how do i apologize for ruining someones life besides my own <eos> regrets on the back of the boat <eos> i guess im all out of time <eos> looking for a treasure <eos> that i knew id never find <eos> i know its not what we planned <eos> but i had to take a chance <eos> and i failed <eos> take this note <eos> tear it to pieces <eos> if i let you down again <eos> as i float away <eos> let the kerosene spill <eos> soak the lighthouse floor <eos> i know its not an answer <eos> and i know its not a cure <eos> i try to get to shore <eos> i hope the moon will keep his promises <eos> and get me back to land <eos> this time as i float away <eos> there wont be one more chance <eos> theres always one more chance <eos> take this note <eos> tear it to pieces again a sailor at sea for years <eos> with weathered skin an untamed beard <eos> somewhere hidden within he had a secret he couldnt swim <eos> suddenly pulled overboard yards from shore <eos> a belt of lead around his waist pulled him to the floor <eos> this sailor he wont flail his chest is filled with pride <eos> in this life i cant swim but soon im gonna fly <eos> id rather drown tonight than let them know that i cant swim <eos> thats what he said as he sunk to the bottom <eos> now his secret is safe at the bottom of the sea <eos> buried just like treasure thats where it will be <eos> its a treasure no man wants or ever will seek <eos> his secret is safe with me <eos> id rather drown tonight than let them know that i cant swim <eos> thats what he said as he sunk to the bottom <eos>

<eos> then after well pretend that i am <eos> lets play a game that crazy game <eos> where everything is okay <eos> then after well pretend that i am <eos> who you want me to be <eos> ive grown a taste for apathy <eos> a last attempt at sanity <eos> so forgive me <eos> if it seems like i dont care <eos> all these night we wasted time dancing around the truth <eos> well im sorry i dont feel

shes a whisper in my dreams <eos> i fell asleep and i woke up changed <eos> i cant forget i watched her as she faded away <eos> i cant forget <eos> shes in my head <eos> i want to go back and free her from these flames <eos> chorus youre sending messages transmitted in morse code <eos> and im decoding as they beat right through your chest <eos> tell me again if im not mistaken <eos> ill tell you

life we get <eos> take a look i guarantee youll decide this is wrong <eos> caught in a daze of blinding denial <eos> "this is only in my head" <eos> change the subject crack a smile <eos> while the children all end up dead <eos> chorus <eos> overlooking the signs overlooking the signs <eos> as we all fall one by one <eos> i will never pretend i will never pretend that all this shit isnt happening <eos> god knows that this is not our fault <eos> a little girl screams in horror <eos> his blood trickles down her face <eos> innocence fades out through her eyes shes been wronged <eos>

blessing <eos> at this confession ill be the spark that ignites a flame <eos> wilderness that you try and tame <eos> ill be the first to tell you that i dont care i dont care <eos> inviting eyes and a dashing smile <eos> are just enough to hide away the demon that ive turned into <eos> in a pact that i cant back out of <eos> dialogues in a parking lot <eos> sharpened words tearing through your sanity <eos> theyre ripping through your sanity <eos> and were riding scars now <eos> prechorus <eos> caught in between <eos> what i love and what i need <eos> caught in between <eos> this is what i need these apathetic eyes <eos> dark just like the sky <eos> the raindrops hit the window sill <eos> so leave me here tonight <eos> leave me by myself <eos> with all my imperfections <eos> running through my head <eos> everything i wished i was <eos> running through my head <eos> forget about the sun <eos> tonight the world revolves around you <eos> i could swear your frown <eos> pulled the clouds down from the sky <eos> created this fog tonight <eos> and on the car ride home <eos> you retreated to your head <eos> a thousand words i should have said <eos> running through my head <eos> but we just stared at the road <eos> running through my head <eos> and you just cried <eos> forget about the sun <eos> tonight the world revolves around you this is what i wanted <eos> a chance for a better life than this <eos> a life that i cant get if im stuck here on dry land <eos> and when were on the open sea <eos> ill take my secrets write them down for you to see <eos> tear them to shreds and then ill throw them overboard <eos> ill watch my words fade into the tide <eos> when the anchor drops for the last time ill be free <eos> and i know that ill be miserable <eos> when the hurricanes become unbearable <eos> and when the lines get tangled up <eos> and the nets are torn apart <eos> having turned into the wind <eos> and the crashing waves they knock me from my feet <eos> i hope youll remember me <eos> when this boy becomes a man <eos> if i never make it home <eos> just know i didnt die alone <eos> pretending this is all i want to say <eos> even if im turned into the wind <eos> pretending this is all i want to say as you cry this is good bye <eos> pretending this is all i want to say <eos> even though ive turned into the wind <eos> pretending this is all i want to say <eos> its not all i want to say <eos> its not all i want to say <eos> thats all there is to say she led me to the wasteland <eos> carpet floors turn to desert sand <eos> a whisper crept up and stole my breath <eos> suddenly i stepped on a scorpion <eos> i felt the poisoned sting <eos> inject and fill my veins <eos> skies blackened then the wind <eos> brought smiles and pouring rain <eos> we walked into the reception <eos> all the guests were dressed in white <eos> the trumpets played in our honor <eos> were gonna dance tonight <eos> losing consciousness again <eos> shadows dance upon the ceiling <eos> theyll never find me ill be buried by the sand <eos> what has she done <eos> the trumpets fade into a whisper <eos> and the guests returned home <eos> she led me to the exit <eos> when i heard the morning call <eos> losing consciousness again <eos> shadows dance upon the ceiling <eos> theyll never find me ill be buried by the sand <eos> what has she done <eos> and ill die pretend pretend pretend that i cant see you knocking down my door <eos> as your silhouette paints the floor <eos> just like before <eos> who am i to think that i could be the one to change this terrible arrangement <eos> when all i can hear is her breathing <eos> prechorus <eos> i lock the door but she walks through the walls <eos> you wont get my sympathy this time <eos> i lock the door but she walks through the walls the walls <eos> chorus <eos> had eternity and through it away and ill be damned if i follow in your footsteps <eos> post chorus <eos> ive been through the wasteland <eos> ive wrestled your demons <eos> carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself <eos> pretend pretend pretend that you cant hear me begging you to leave <eos> these rendezvous are getting stale <eos> and out of hand <eos> who are you to think that you could be the one to force this terrible engagement <eos> when im wide awake but im dreaming <eos> i lock the door but she walks through the walls <eos> you wont get my sympathy this time <eos> i lock the door but she walks through the walls the walls <eos> had eternity and through it away and ill be damned if i follow in your footsteps <eos> ive been through the wasteland <eos> ive wrestled your demons <eos> carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself <eos> ive been through the wasteland <eos> ive wrestled your demons <eos> carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself <eos> in your eyes i see a ghost <eos> break the glass by throwing stones <eos> and im braced for anything <eos> im braced <eos> the glass will break x mary had a little hatchet <eos> in a box hidden under her bed <eos> she held it close to her chest and she thought <eos> "this would look great in the back of his head" <eos> "if you take my life i will take your dreams <eos> get my revenge by any means if you take my life i will take your dreams" <eos> now mary was extra quiet <eos> as she crept in through the bedroom door <eos> all her anger took a life of its own <eos> "this fuck wont hurt me anymore" <eos> "if you take my life i will take your dreams <eos> get my revenge by any means if you take my life i will take your dreams" <eos> chorus <eos> "ill make you suffer like i have" <eos> i suggest you get the hell out of this town <eos> because tonight shes on a roll <eos> "ill make you bleed just like ive bled" <eos> i suggest you get the hell out of this town <eos> because tonight shes on a roll <eos> now all thats lefts a bloody mess <eos> as his body lay still on the bed <eos> she took a look at the scene and she thought <eos> "he looks better with an axe in his head" <eos> "if you take my life i will take your dreams <eos> get my revenge by any means if you take my life i will take your dreams" <eos> chorus <eos> roll lets roll <eos> ill make you bleed like ive bled <eos> chorus the curtains slice the rays of sun <eos> that sneak into my bedroom <eos> like bars on my wall <eos> salt water saturates <eos> the carpet under me <eos> i havent got much sleep at all <eos> and when the morning calls <eos> im calling back to her <eos> we spent our nights out watching shadows walking <eos> i cant tell if ive become one too <eos> i let myself go numb <eos> it only made thing worse <eos> splitting my time between shadows and light <eos> unaware of the difference <eos> the trumpets still ringing in my head <eos> crunch sand between my teeth <eos> sandpaper tongues cant speak <eos> dont think ill ever speak again <eos> and when the morning calls <eos> im calling back to her <eos> we spent our nights out watching shadows walking <eos> i cant tell if ive become one too <eos> dont let yourself go numb <eos> it only made things worse la verdad no se como estaras <eos> o si encontraste en alguien mas <eos> lo que al final no supe darte <eos> y que tal vez lo merecias <eos> y esto lo digo sin rencor aunque yo eh sido el perdedor <eos> es que mis heridas <eos> nunca sanaran este vacio sigue igual <eos> como la tarde que arrancaste lo mas hermoso de mi vida <eos> mi corazon no late igual <eos> creo que pretende renunciar <eos> hasta la fecha no e encontrado quien me quiera <eos> por que tu ausencia me persigue a donde sea <eos> es tan dificil respirar <eos> por que hasta el aire me hace mal necesito mas de ti <eos> quiero que sepas que te amo <eos> que si me ahogo en el dolor es por la falta de tu amor <eos> necesito mas de ti <eos> de las caricias de tus manos maldito orgullo que mato de golpe nuestra relacion <eos> hasta la fecha no encontrado quien me quiera por que tu ausencia me persigue a donde sea <eos> es tan dificil respirar por que hasta el aire me hace mal <eos> necesito mas de ti <eos> quiero que sepas que te amo <eos> que si me ahogo en el dolor es por la falta de tu amor <eos> necesito mas de ti <eos> de las cariacias de tus manos maldito orgullo que mato <eos> de golpe nuestra relacion <eos> necesito mas de ti yo se que su recuerdo no me hace ningun bien <eos> tan solo me lastima pensar en su querer <eos> recuerdo bien sus ojos como diciendo adios <eos> y sin media palabra su imagen se marcho <eos> y que puedo yo hacer si ella se fue de aqui <eos> y solo me he quedado con la fria soledad <eos> dime porque se fue si la adore <eos> contestame amiga soledad <eos> si algo le falto no fue amor <eos> eso fue lo que yo le di de mas <eos> recuerdo bien sus ojos como diciendo adios <eos> y sin media palabra su imagen se marcho <eos> y que puedo yo hacer si ella se fue de aqui <eos> y solo me he quedado con la fria soledad <eos> dime porque se fue si la adore <eos> contestame amiga soledad <eos> si algo le falto no fue amor <eos> eso fue lo que yo le di de mas <eos> quiero saber en que falle <eos> quisiera yo saber que hice mal <eos> o si tal vez me equivoque <eos> al entregar mi vida sin pensar <eos> contestame estar contigo asi <eos> me ha hecho comprender <eos> que nada soy sin ti <eos> que temo enloquecer <eos> por que no se que hacer <eos> con migo <eos> te extrao mucho mas <eos> que aun cuando no estas <eos> que aun cuando hace frio <eos> platico con tu voz <eos> tan debil como yo <eos> y percibo <eos> que no hago falta yo lo se <eos> que me haces dao por placer <eos> quien eres tu que se ha irrumpido en nuestras <eos> vidas <eos> con que derecho me demuestras tus heridas <eos> ella es tan fuerte no como tu <eos> por que no te marchas y regresas otra ves <eos> sabes me arrodillo del temor <eos> es que te has vuelto no se quien <eos> por que no me abrazas y me pides que este bien <eos> es tan impotente tu actidud <eos> crece tu llanto y en tu piel <eos> yo me reflejo con tantas dudas <eos> y espero ansioso que me digas ven aprendi a extraar y a necesitar <eos> aprendi a sentirme desolado <eos> como un tonto fui inventando <eos> que tambien te sientes igual <eos> quise imaginar que la solucion <eos> para que volvieras a mi lado <eos> era estarte recordando cada dia un poco mas <eos> y aunque todo fracaso <eos> y tus labios no he vuelto a besar <eos> y tus manos no he vuelto a tocar <eos> con el tiempo crece mas esta esperanza <eos> y todo por amarte tanto <eos> y todo por quererte tanto <eos> y todo por soarte tanto <eos> que no me importa sufrir <eos> todo es sobre ti <eos> y todo por desearte tanto <eos> y todo por pensarte tanto <eos> y todo por no hacerte dao <eos> se que pudiste sentir <eos> lo que me hiciste sentir <eos> por amarte tanto <eos> y aunque todo fracaso <eos> y tus labios no he vuelto a besar <eos> y tus manos no he vuelto a tocar <eos> con el tiempo crece mas esta esperanza <eos> y todo por amarte tanto <eos> y todo por quererte tanto <eos> y todo por soarte tanto <eos> que no me importa sufrir <eos> todo es sobre ti <eos> y todo por desearte tanto <eos> y todo por pensarte tanto <eos> y todo por no hacerte dao <eos> se que pudiste sentir <eos> lo que me hiciste sentir <eos> por amarte tanto hoy amanecio um poco nublado <eos> pronosticaron la tormenta devastante <eos> pero mi viaje no podia cancelarlo <eos> me hacia falta retenerteacariciarte <eos> fueron muchas horas anhelando <eos> mas de lo que pude imaginarme <eos> es que el destino es tan perfecto <eos> tan exacto <eos> que descubri por que jamas debi buscarte <eos> el te besaba con tanta pasion <eos> que de tristeza la noche lloro <eos> fue tan extrao calle mi dolor <eos> pero mi alma no se resistio <eos> si te molesto <eos> disculpame <eos> de que te amo <eos> no tengo ni una duda <eos> pero es una tortura que me daa el corazon <eos> mejor me marcho <eos> con rumbo a mi fortuna <eos> pidiendole a la luna que te llene de ilusion <eos> para que siempre <eos> seas feliz <eos> y despues de la tormenta <eos> sea yo <eos> el te besaba con tanta pasion <eos>

recibir de tu rechazo <eos> y otra vez me duermo <eos> sondote en mis brazos <eos> de mi amor te aprovechas <eos> me tomas como un juego <eos> tan solo soy el mago <eos> que cumples tu deseos <eos> pero cansado ya me tienen tus caprichos <eos> ya no me basta que me quieras como amigo <eos> no crees que merezco <eos> una noche contigo <eos> porque no existe un idiota como yo <eos> que a ti se aferre y se trague el orgullo cuando le dices que no <eos> que te perdone que lo quieras ver sufrir <eos> y a que le cale tu dolor tal como a m <eos> pero esta noche si no me dices que si <eos> te juro que renuncio a todo <eos> y se bien que tu te vas arrepentir <eos> al ver a otra susurrndome al odo <eos> vas a sentir lo que es el miedo de perder <eos> al quien mas te ha querido <eos> de mi amor te aprovechas <eos> me tomas como un juego <eos> tan solo soy el mago que cumples tu deseos <eos> pero cansado ya me tienen tus caprichos <eos> ya no me basta que me quieras como amigo <eos> no

<eos> y aunque duelen tus rechazos sigo mas que obsesionado <eos> es mi terco corazn el que me exije buscarte <eos> y soar que un da de estos me vas a pedir besarte <eos> pero la fe y esperanza se me van desvaneciendo <eos> pues parece no importarte lo que por ti estoy sintiendo <eos> chorus <eos> ya no se si voy o vengo me traes todo confundido <eos> porque se que existe alguien mas que quiere andar contigo <eos> tengo rabia y siento celos nadamas de imaginarme <eos> que a el si le permitieras intentar enamorarte <eos> pero tengo que seguir no caerme derrotado <eos> si es preciso doy la vida por llevarte de mi mano <eos> y aunque sufro por quererte al no ser correspondido <eos> tambien se que no es tu culpa que me quieras como amigo <eos> bridge <eos> chorus <eos> ya no se si voy o vengo me traes todo confundido <eos> porque se que existe alguien mas que quiere andar contigo <eos> tengo rabia y siento celos nadamas de imaginarme <eos> que a el si le permitieras intentar

volver a ser yo mismo <eos> asi como era yo <eos> contigo <eos> tengo miedo no poder tocar tu piel <eos> el camino hacia tus brazos ya olvide <eos> tengo miedo que el fantasma del olvido <eos> me arranque la ilusion <eos> lo admito <eos> asi como admito que te amo y que me aferro <eos> asi como nado en una alberca de silencio <eos> donde ahogo sin tu amor <eos> y muero <eos> tal vez ahora siga igual <eos> tal vez maana volveras <eos> tal vez regrese mi cordura y tu recuerdo se llege a marchar <eos> a donde fuiste <eos> tu <eos> donde no existe <eos> luz <eos> donde la vida no tiene principio ni tiene final <eos> a donde sigues <eos> tu <eos> siempre tan bella <eos> tu <eos> donde los aos no tocan tu rostro ni te hacen cambiar <eos> como he cambiado yo <eos> junto con mi actitud <eos> no me comparo hoy con lo que antes fui <eos> tal vez ahora siga igual <eos> tal vez maana volveras <eos> tal vez regrese mi cordura y tu recuerdo se llege a marchar <eos> a donde fuiste <eos> tu <eos> donde no existe <eos> luz <eos> donde la vida no tiene principio ni tiene final <eos> a donde sigues <eos> tu <eos> siempre tan bella <eos> tu <eos> donde los aos no tocan tu rostro ni te hacen cambiar <eos> como he cambiado yo <eos> junto con mi actitud <eos> no me comparo hoy con lo que antes fui hay tantos espacios coro sobran tantos espacios desde que no estas <eos> todo mi mundo cambio hasta perdi su color tengo por compaera la oscuridad <eos> solo me abraza el fri de tu ausencia hoy <eos> hoy los rayos del sol no calientan igual <eos> me haces falta en el aire para respirar <eos> vivo aferrado a un recuerdo y no tengo ms <eos> del pasado que se que ya no volver <eos> hay tantas cosas que aun me recuerdan que no estas <eos> hay tanto espacio vaci que aun nose como llenar <eos> es que dejaste una sombra en mi cuarto <eos> y aparte el recuerdo de ti que me platica y se sienta a mi lado y me dice que no eres feliz <eos> y es que dejaste un espacio tan grande que no puedo llenar me falta todo y no encuentro a alguien que me ayude a olvidar <eos> y puede que esta llegue a no importar esto que estoy sintiendo hoy <eos> lo que me importa es este espacio tan fri y tan grande que solo lleno con tu nombre <eos> solo llenare con tu mirada <eos> hay tantas cosas que aun me recuerdan que no estas <eos> hay tanto espacio vaci que aun nose como llenar <eos> es que dejaste una sombra en mi cuarto <eos> y parte el recuerdo de ti que me platica y se sienta a mi lado y me dice que no eres feliz <eos> y es que dejaste un espacio tan grande que no puedo llenar me falta todo y no encuentro a alguien que me ayude a olvidar <eos> y puede que esta llegue a no importar esto que estoy sintiendo hoy <eos> lo que me importa es este espacio tan fri y tan grande que solo lleno con tu nombre <eos> que solo llenare contigo amor hay tantos espacios hay tantos espacios son tantos recuerdos que contigo forme <eos> llenaste mi vida de felicidad y ilusion <eos> desde este dia quieres desaparecer <eos> dejandome solo un porque y un adios <eos> y no no puede ser asi <eos> despues de tanto tiempo que nos adoramos tu y yo <eos> esque el amor no acaba con un simple adios <eos> que tu me has entregado <eos> no puede terminar si todo iva tan bien <eos> que nos esta pasando <eos> esque el amor no acaba aunque quieras fingir <eos> no puedes ocultarlo <eos> me lo dicen tus ojos y mirar tus labios <eos> como estan temblando <eos> y no no puede ser asi <eos> despues de tanto tiempo que nos adoramos tu y yo <eos> esque el amor no acaba con un simple adios <eos> que tu me has entregado <eos> no puede terminar si todo iva tan bien <eos> que nos esta pasando <eos> esque el amor no acaba aunque quieras fingir <eos> no puedes ocultarlo <eos> me lo dicen tus ojos y mirar tus labios <eos> como estan temblando <eos> esque el amor no acaba tan solo en un minuto <eos> nesesitas mil aos para olvidar lo que nos hemos dado <eos> esque el amor no acaba porque el amor no acaba <eos> porque el amor no acaba porque el amor no acaba ella es duena de mi pasado why mi presente <eos> ella se a encargado de <eos> darle un toque de que se yo <eos> a mi vida aburrida x <eos> si no hubiese sido por ella <eos> donde estaria hoy <eos> ella siempre viaja a mi lado <eos> aun contra corriente x <eos> es a ella a quien devo darle gracias <eos> por aceptar defectos why manias <eos> ni cuatro vidas me alcansaria <eos> para decirle que es por ella x <eos> que suelo con los dedos <eos> aranar estrellas <eos> si tengo mucho o poco se lo devo a ella <eos> recuerdo aquellos anos cuando <eos> descubrimos juntos que las deudas <eos> no se pagan con risas <eos> que los suenos cuestan ansurjido problemas <eos> why siempre me alienta tan solo <eos> de su mano encuentro la respuesta solo por ella x espero que estã©s <eos> contenta feliz <eos> resulta que despuã©s de amarnos como locos simplemente dices que ah llegado el fin <eos> me duele tu adiã³s <eos> pero el te ofreciã³ <eos> un castillo de oro y yo solo mis sueã±os y un pequeã±o apartamento para dos <eos> procura fingir que nadie ah navegado por tu lindo cuerpo <eos> que nadie besã³ la cicatriz pequeã±a que adorna tu espalda <eos> y pã­dele a dios que si el te lleva al punto de araã±ar el cielo <eos> que apague la voz para que no le grites mi maldito nombre <eos> y ojalã¡ el puã±o de diamantes que el te ah prometido <eos> soborne en tus ansias cuando sientas ganas de jugar con migo <eos> y que esos detalles se vuelvan cadenas de tus emociones <eos> para que no sufras el dolor que causan las desilusiones <eos> te prometo que nuestro romance morirã¡ en silencio <eos> yo haber como le hago pa sanar del vicio de sentir tus labios <eos> rodar por mi piel besando cada espacio de mi anatomã­a <eos> brindã¡ndome vidas <eos> que triste aceptarlo hoy pierdo a la reina <eos> de mis fantasã­as si estas pensando que te voy a rogar <eos> debes saber que estas muy equivocada <eos> ya te has pasado muchasveces la raya <eos> y mi paciencia se encuentra agotada <eos> terminada el primer paso yo no lo voy a dar <eos> sigo tu rumbo si el orgullo te gana <eos> te juro que de veras eres extraã±a <eos> sabes que fallas pero no dices nada solo callas <eos> si estas pensando muy en serio mi amor <eos> que tus caprichos valen mas que los dos <eos> yo solamente un consejo te doy <eos> llevate suficientes cosas mi amor porque el camino es largo <eos> y yo no intento detenerte que tengas mejor suerte <eos> me duele decir esto corazon pero yo se que tengo razon <eos> y asi como tu eres prefiero para siempre un adios <eos> si estas pensando muy en serio mi amor <eos> que tus caprichos valen mas que los dos <eos> yo solamente un consejo te doy <eos> llevate suficientes cosas mi amor porque el camino es largo <eos> y yo no intento detenerte

<eos> y la forma en que me miras <eos> cuando me hablas me atrapas <eos> me ganas y pierdo la batalla <eos> porque soy como no soy <eos> con las ganas de abrasarte de besarte y de decirte lo que siento y lo intento y me arrepiento y luego vuelvo decidir y no me atrevo porque soy como no soy <eos> x <eos> y me siento un estupido porque no puedo decirte que te amo apesar de que te veo tras adiaro no me atrevo a decirte <eos> que me gustas de hace tiempo <eos> vives en mi pensamientos <eos> que me muero por besarte <eos> que te amo mas que a nadie <eos> que me gustas de hace tiempo <eos> esperando este momento <eos> de asercarme y confesarte <eos> que amarte fue inevitable <eos> dame una senal si es que no sientes como yo sacame de este infierno por favor <eos> x hablar de ti es como <eos> hablar de la mas bella poesa <eos> hablar de ti es imposible <eos> porque no terminaria <eos> hablar de ti es desifrar <eos> lo mas hermoso de la vida <eos> hablar de ti es inventar <eos> lo que jamas existira <eos> que me llamen loco <eos> si te amo es cosa mia <eos> porque al fin de cuentas <eos> nunca nadie entenderia <eos> que si vivo es para ti <eos> si muero es por ti <eos> por que cada instante que <eos> no tengo tu sonrisa significa un <eos> instante de ilusion en donde doy <eos> mi corazon porque cada paso <eos> esto ya no es un te quiero que <eos> yo guardo solamente por amor <eos> es tan real esta pasin <eos> tu sombra va entre la gente entre <eos> tu risa y mi dolor tan inocente <eos> que no sabe ni quien soy <eos> hablar de ti es desifrar lo mas <eos> hermoso de la vida

retenerla entre sus brazos <eos> para no perder su amor <eos> entonces comprendi que se alejo <eos> llevando tanta desepcion <eos> enamorada de aquel tonto <eos> que jamas le demostro <eos> este amor que aun me quema por las venas <eos> porque te amo mas que nunca <eos> aunque no lo sepas i wasnt born to no rich mans home <eos> always spent most of my time alone <eos> some folksll say they never saw me smile <eos> that i was born to old to be a child <eos> chorus <eos> but for a while there was you <eos> strong enough to pull me through <eos> for a while there was you <eos> sometimes that pasts too hard to lose <eos> with a face that never bore no stress <eos> it was the way you smoked that cigarette <eos> lived life in the present tense <eos> but in your eyes i was just a child <eos> when you lost your job and went out west <eos> oh you went out there on weightless steps <eos> chorus <eos> bridge <eos> you were called the tragic sister giving nothing but a sigh <eos> though the winter on the river overshadowed your goodbyes <eos> spending late nights by the mirror aint the snowfall left you sleepless <eos> burning money like a picture all thats left right now is time <eos> chorus whoah oh oh oh <eos> whoah oh oh oh <eos> his name is jeremy working in it <eos> never questions why he has always been <eos> an extremely careful guy sensitive and shy <eos> risk assessment is his investment in a life of no surprise <eos> till she walked into his life <eos> she spontaneous indeed uncertaintys her creed <eos> she has always been nither black or white <eos> just a curious delight <eos> she threw affection in his direction a collection of her smiles <eos> and to his surprise <eos> shes like tomorrow oh so distant she just wants to play <eos> like tomorrow she is always

<eos> i know theres someone <eos> who waits for me crows in the sky <eos> ill drown in my glory <eos> and youll feel me when its done <eos> the roads that ive lost <eos> tell my whole story <eos> as loud as a sigh <eos> im the pawn in the streets cant back down <eos> im the king in the streets cant fall down <eos> ooh when will i slide slowly up to the light im the one who is lost in the mirror <eos> lost to feel which part is chosen to stay behind <eos> im the spark but cannot burn forever <eos> im the man who is shot by the rain <eos> im the fuss each time waking in another tunnel <eos> feeling blind until i find the exit light <eos> time is ticking in my head for what matter <eos> im the man who is shot by the rain <eos> steady thoughts are getting strong and tangled <eos> and im the one collecting signs from the clouds <eos> point is high distance is too far to fester <eos> im the man who is shot by the rain stuck in limbo <eos> count to <eos> ache your crumbling soul <eos> youre a whale in a little fish bowl <eos> unlock leaky doors <eos> reveal blurry goals <eos> one day youll be yours <eos> youre a whale in a little fish bowl <eos> sometimes its hard to go back <eos> hard to go back to the ocean <eos> sometimes its hard to go back <eos> hard to go back to the blue ocean <eos> stuck in limbo count <eos> ache your crumbling soul youre a whale <eos> stuck in limbo count to <eos> get your crawling soul up youre a whale stay awake my enslaved mind <eos> you will be solved again and do whatever they want <eos> turn away my shutin heart <eos> you heard the voice down there <eos> keeps resounding in your skull <eos> away off shore <eos> drifting reverse the course <eos> wheres the hill i belong <eos> what makes wings heal makes them grow <eos> wheres the dream i split off and float <eos> flames rise over to blind <eos> and these tame owls will never fly that high <eos> roll your falling and loaded dice <eos> youre drifting and pulling the sky <eos> but there will be time to face it ooh thats the light that makes me a fool <eos> ooh thats your right and that is wrong <eos> you may tease me while im around <eos> cause im no longer your delight <eos> everytime you break this hopeful screaming <eos> eyes deny the butterflies and seek the night <eos> dont show me how you dig this hole <eos> the end must be tough and unknown <eos> our mystery is just mythical <eos> our faith is placed in last chances <eos> everytime you break this hopeful screaming <eos> eyes deny the butterflies and seek the night im an orphan <eos> on gods highway <eos> and ill share my troubles <eos> if you go my way <eos> i have no mother <eos> no father <eos> no sister <eos> no brother <eos> i am an orphan child <eos> ive had friendships <eos> children holding <eos> a thousand kinships <eos> have not known them <eos> ive known no mother <eos> no father <eos> no sister <eos> no brother <eos> i am an orphan child <eos> blessed savior <eos> if youre willing <eos> walk beside me <eos> til im with him <eos> be my mother <eos> my father <eos> my sister <eos> my brother <eos> i am an orphan child <eos> when he calls me <eos> i will be able <eos> to meet my family <eos> at gods table <eos> ill meet my mother <eos> my father <eos> my sister <eos> my brother <eos> no more an orphan child were you there when they crucified my lord <eos> were you there when they crucified my lord <eos> oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble <eos> tremble <eos> were you there when they crucified my lord <eos> were you there when they nailed hi to the tree <eos> were you there when they pierced him in the side <eos> were you there when the sun refused to shine <eos> were you there when they laid him i the tomb he packed up his guitar <eos> and drove wednesday through sunday <eos> and sometimes played three shows a day <eos> the modern lone rider he dreamed of ohio <eos> and his doeeyed arabian bay <eos> and how theyd go racing out on the hillside <eos> in the cool closing twilight of day <eos> old friends together in thunderous freedom <eos> just the man and the wind and the bay <eos> well sometimes theyd ride down by the river <eos> and the bay always stopped there to drink <eos> in the still of the evening <eos> the horse seemed contented <eos> and the man used the time just to think <eos> and in the cold winds of winter <eos> hes drawn to the barn <eos> by some irresistable force <eos> with carrots and a blanket <eos> theres nothing more binding <eos> than the love of a man for his horse <eos> the call of the highway how it would beckon <eos> he kept going back out of course <eos> and in the deep of the night <eos> when the miles were the hardest <eos> he just figured he drove for the horse <eos> and in all lifes relations one thing stays the same <eos> never take more than you will repay <eos> so we count the score even <eos> cause the miles he had driven <eos> were for miles that he rode on the bay <eos> they grew old together got too old to ride <eos> but just look at the seeds that theyd sowed <eos> theyd walk out in the pasture stand side by side <eos> and stare off at the hills where theyd growed <eos> and of all gods creations here under heaven <eos> theres many i cant understand <eos> one beautiful mystery that i at least witnessed <eos> was the love of a horse for a man who can tell just how it starts <eos> angry words and broken hearts <eos> till silently we sit apart <eos> you and i <eos> but in awhile the angers gone <eos> and we forget whos right or wrong <eos> then one of us will end it all <eos> with just a smile <eos> we believe in happy endings <eos> never breaking <eos> only bending <eos> taking time enough for mending <eos> the hurt inside <eos> we believe in new beginnings <eos> giving in <eos> and forgiving <eos> we believe happy endings <eos> you and i <eos> just a word is all it takes <eos> and so it pass <eos> the silence breaks <eos> and looking back it makes us ache <eos> for what weve done <eos> and so we cling together now <eos> and wonder why were oh so proud <eos> when all that matters anyhow <eos> is our love <eos> we believe in happy endings <eos> never breaking <eos> only bending <eos> taking time enough for mending <eos> the hurt inside <eos> we believe in new beginnings <eos> giving in <eos> and forgiving <eos> we believe in happy endings <eos> you and i rollin rollin on these rubber wheels <eos> someday baby youll know how it feels <eos> to be broken hearted and to be left all alone <eos> these wheels were made round to roll <eos> and ill keep rollin on <eos> when i left you i told you son you aint satisfied <eos> the last time when i left home you laughed while i cried <eos> you think youre pretty smart right now but ill show you sometime <eos> go on and have your fun while i roll on down the line <eos> rollin rollin on these rubber wheels <eos> someday baby youll know how it feels <eos> to be broken hearted and to be left all alone <eos> these wheels were made round to roll <eos> and ill keep rollin on <eos> now theres a little stop ahead and thingsll pick up now <eos> a cup of coffee and two blue eyes and one to keep somehow <eos> go on and have your fun dont worry none about me <eos> you play the game of thinking lost and now youre fancy free i met a man in richmond <eos> laid out on the street <eos> white lightning in a bottle <eos> discarded at his feet <eos> this dirty broken derelect <eos> could barely speak my name <eos> he raised his head and looked my way <eos> the words they slowly came <eos> play dixie for me billy <eos> ill hold my head up proud <eos> sing about them fields of cotton <eos> sing it for me loud <eos> sing about the bullruns <eos> sing about the day <eos> i shot my brother dressed in blue <eos> while i was dressed in grey <eos> we marched out from manassas <eos> cannons on our tail <eos> set fire to the cornfields <eos> tore up all the rails <eos> met up at the bullrun <eos> neither broke away <eos> the ballad of the bullrun <eos> told in blue and grey <eos> they marched us down to vicksburg <eos> by then we didnt care <eos> it didnt matter where we went <eos> our death was in the air <eos> i had a couple brothers <eos> and each of them would say <eos> as one would shoot the other <eos> a prayer for blue and grey often times in my memories i wondered again <eos> to the little old church by the road <eos> i could see the dear people and hear them so plain <eos> singing songs of that blessed dear lord <eos> i could hear my dear mother as she formidably prayed <eos> blessed jesus help me carry my load <eos> she was never downhearted never dismayed <eos> in that little old church by the road <eos> chorus <eos> there my mother would pray <eos> and my sister was saved <eos> singing sinners come and repent of your sins <eos> there the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out <eos> and the bread was saved amen <eos> it was there i met jesus and gave him my life <eos> it was there he took the weight off my load <eos> and he freely removed all my sorrow and strife <eos> in that little old church by the road <eos> i remember the preacher so gentle and brave <eos> as he told how the father above <eos> gave his only son jesus all the lost ones to save <eos> such wonderful wonderful love <eos> i will always remember when the preacher would say <eos> come to jesus hell lighten your load <eos> so often he preached of the life giving bread <eos> in that little old church by the road <eos> chorus <eos> i could never forget all those lovely old songs <eos> that the people so joyfully sang <eos> how they told the lords message to sinners gone wrong <eos> and the echoes so joyfully rang <eos> i would always remember how i truly believed <eos> jesus took all the weight off my load <eos> and the joy of salvation i truly received <eos> in that little old church by the road <eos> chorus i once had a mansion and lived in my glory <eos> but now im down to my last dime <eos> i had a sweetheart but i was unfaithful <eos> oh ive lived a lot in my time <eos> i fought the grim reaper down in the dark valley <eos> prayed when the sun wouldnt shine <eos> ive looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison <eos> yes ive lived a lot in my time <eos> ive been a soldier and ive been a rambler <eos> once thought that everything was fine <eos> ive put in the cornfields ive picked in the cotton <eos> yes ive lived a lot in my time <eos> ive walked with our master down in the dark valley <eos> and wonderful peace i did find <eos> someday ill journey to edens green pastures <eos> ive lived a lot in my time in a pawn shop in chicago <eos> on a sunny summer day <eos> a couple gazes at the wedding rings <eos> there on display <eos> she smiles and nods her head <eos> as he says "honey thats for you <eos> its not much but its the best <eos> that i can do" <eos> golden rings with one tiny little stone <eos> waiting there for someone to take you home <eos> by itself its just a cold metallic thing <eos> only love can make a golden wedding ring <eos> in a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon <eos> an old upright piano plays that old familiar tune <eos> tears roll down her cheeks <eos> and happy thoughts run through her head <eos> as he whispers low "with this ring i thee wed" <eos> golden ring with one tiny little stone <eos> shining ring now at last its found a home <eos> by itself its just a cold metallic thing <eos> only love can make a golden wedding ring <eos> in a small two room apartment <eos> as they fought their final round <eos> he says "you wont admit it <eos> but i know youre leavin town" <eos> she says "one things for certain <eos> i dont love you any more" <eos> and throws down the ring <eos> as she walks out the door <eos> golden ring with one tiny little stone <eos> cast aside like the love thats dead and gone <eos> by itself its just a cold metallic thing <eos> only love can make a golden wedding ring <eos> in a pawn shop in chicago <eos> on a sunny summer day <eos> a couple gazes at the wedding rings <eos> there on display <eos> golden ring well a big cardboard suitcase and a fouryear

was known as a modern day marvel <eos> a great railroad that crossed over sea <eos> it defied all the whitecaps and the deep coral bed <eos> and linked the whole world to the keys <eos> who should take on this lofty endeavor <eos> but a man who they said was obsessed <eos> whod made millions of dollars refining crude oil <eos> now his focus was on reaching key west <eos> skeptics and cynics who used pens as their lances <eos> took cheap shots at him and asked what were the chances <eos> that the railroad youre building make good on the quest <eos> of rolling over the ocean right into key west <eos> the last train to paradise <eos> theyd dubbed flaglers folly for the use of a knife <eos> undeterred by their antics henry went on with life <eos> and drew up the plans for the last train to paradise <eos> it all started when he first came to florida <eos> his friends told him that he should retire <eos> you could live off your wealth till the end of your days <eos> but inside henry still had his fire <eos> he said this place aint what it could be <eos> with the weather so nice all year round <eos> so ill buy up the halifax jacksonville rail <eos> and track it south from town to town <eos> well track over rivers and track over streams <eos> well track over farmland and other mans dreams <eos> well track it through mangroves and track it through the fields <eos> and were we cant track we will dredge for the fill <eos> well build the last train to paradise <eos> new towns and new hotels where the weather is nice <eos> right on to fort dallas where they suffer no ice <eos> he continued to build the last train to paradise <eos> when the railroad got as far south as homestead <eos> they thought henry had then done his best <eos> but in the back of his brain a notion remained <eos> to take the railroad right on to key west <eos> where deep water awaited the liners <eos> and shipping trades to the canal <eos> but what stood in his way was the great biscayne bay <eos> and an inlet that spanned miles <eos> faced with the fact that he had to cross ocean <eos> he put all his engineers minds into motion <eos> devising a plan to extend the great line <eos> by building a sea bridge one arch at a time <eos> the last train to paradise <eos> rolled over the ocean against all advice <eos> almost in defiance he didnt think twice <eos> he had completed the last train to paradise <eos> mother nature had dealt him some losses <eos> hurricanes in and <eos> but his vision stayed strong and he vowed to go on <eos> in the memory of the losses men <eos> after long years to completion <eos> he rolled south in his car <eos> he enjoyed every mile with a big eager smile <eos> because impossible things had been done <eos> and the skeptics and cynics who had used pens as their lances <eos> were in awe of the man who had met their advances <eos> henry answered all questions and passed all the test <eos> when the conductor yelled now arriving key west <eos> the last train to paradise <eos> built with muscle and sweat and a vision precise <eos> unparalleled by what he accomplished in life <eos> a divine inspiration the last train to paradise the storm of the

all live the fine life everyday <eos> only few still alive may recall <eos> about the sea and its fury when it was torn by the gales <eos> and how nothing could stand in its way <eos> saltwater canyons made of feet swales <eos> that came ashore one labor day <eos> the pressure was falling the tides on the move <eos> it was nothing liked wed ever seen <eos> winds from the north waves from the south <eos> and a small piece of land in between <eos> we boarded up windows pulled in our boats <eos> made our havens as safe as could be <eos> we couldnt imagine what was to be <eos> everything would end up in the sea <eos> ii	the storm started coming the pressure was dropping <eos> large waves started hitting the beach <eos> lighting was flashing timbers were flying <eos> and safety was clear out of reach <eos> the railroad was sent from south of miami <eos> to rescue us but to no avail <eos> a wave washed the train cars right off of the track <eos> and it ate miles of the rail <eos> the wind knock me over i grabbed my sister <eos> and she clang to me for her young life <eos> she couldnt hang on despite fear in her eyes <eos> and her fingernails digging like knives <eos> i whispered i love you as she drifted away <eos> then some sand blasted me in the eye <eos> i found refuge on the top of a tree <eos> placed there by the foot tide <eos> iii	i awoke the next morning after being unconscious <eos> the storm of the century had past <eos> the slow falling rain mixed with tears in my eyes <eos> as i wondered who all didnt last <eos> no blade of grass no tree left standing <eos> every building was washed out to sea <eos> dazed and confused i stood comprehending <eos> what my eyes told me to see <eos> where is my family where is my home <eos> they were nowhere in sight someone said <eos> i sat by the water with my head in my hands <eos> wondering if i was better off dead <eos> i had to go on they needed my help <eos> as we mournfully stacked all the dead <eos> we all said a prayer then we lit them on fire <eos> its an image that wont leave my head <eos> iv	great walls of water swallowed some whole <eos> in a battle between god and man <eos> four hundred twenty three lives were the toll <eos> and i will never quite understand <eos> an foot monument stands off us <eos> with remains of so many who died <eos> words of remembrance with the date etched in bronze <eos> september nd <eos> i am so lucky that im hear to retell <eos> god gave me a final reprieve <eos> nothing short of a miracle surviving the gales <eos> as i desperately held to a tree <eos> now i share the memory with family and friends <eos> sleepless nights sure have riddled my life <eos> remembering all of the lives lost that day <eos> is a memory that cuts like a knife

<eos> in the middle of the night <eos> youre asleep and yet you say <eos> in your own sweet silent way <eos> that everythings alright <eos> and your hair is lying <eos> cross the pillow by my head <eos> youre unconscious to the night <eos> you cant talk but thats alright <eos> let your breathing speak instead <eos> i hear you breathing in <eos> you breathe out on my skin <eos> thats when i begin <eos> to know youre near me <eos> i dont turn on the light <eos> i dont need to use my eyes <eos> the heartbeat by my side <eos> tells me youre here with me <eos> my senses can deceive me <eos> when im sleepy and confused <eos> from my heavy eyes i see <eos> only darkness around me <eos> my dreams long since excused <eos> then my thoughts go racing <eos> through the cloisters of my brain <eos> in those midnight hours i find <eos> that you hypnotise my mind <eos> with your soothing pulse again <eos> i hear you breathing in <eos> you breathe out on my skin <eos> thats when i begin <eos> to know youre near me <eos> i dont turn on the light <eos> i dont need to use my eyes <eos> the heartbeat by my side <eos> tells me youre here with me i sit and stare at you and wonder how id feel if you werent here <eos> i think youre scared of going under so much more than you appear <eos> its not that i would be more capable than you would <eos> id go on that i know <eos> i just wonder how my life would be without you <eos> so do you i suppose <eos> so do you i suppose <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> and it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> common decency requires me not to act on how i feel <eos> common sense conspires to warn me to behave in spite of me <eos> so i impose on you the thoughts that lie within me <eos> be they mine <eos> be they yours <eos> trying to guess what you are thinking when youre silent <eos> but i cant be sure <eos> no i cant be sure <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> and it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> do i care <eos> are we so beyond repair <eos> or is everything okay <eos> when i leave it up to you <eos> you dont tell me either way <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> and it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> it leaves me wondering if i care <eos> it leaves me wondering if you love me <eos> and it leaves me wondering if i care i felt anticipation early in the spring <eos> i looked forward to the riches it would bring <eos> i smiled the day it led my heart to you <eos> it seemed like the world was smiling too <eos> we laughed and drank and sang in summertime <eos> i felt your body always close to mine <eos> our love was so exciting and so new <eos> it seemed like the world was lauging too <eos> things got colder when the autumn came along <eos> but we straightened out the things that had gone wrong <eos> as the leaves displayed their ever changing hue <eos> it seemed like the world was changing too <eos> the winter brought the rain and then the snow <eos> and i cried out loud the day i saw you go <eos> i didnt really know quite what to do <eos> it seemed like the world was crying too in her imagination <eos> shes driving through the sunshine <eos> to malibu <eos> no children in the backseat <eos> no husband at the wheel <eos> no telling where shes going <eos> just followin the highway <eos> to where it leads <eos> dreamin of leaving <eos> thats all it is <eos> dreamin of something <eos> more than this <eos> dreamin of leaving <eos> thats all it is <eos> dreamin

to remind her <eos> of how it is and how it might have been <eos> dreamin of leaving <eos> thats all it is <eos> dreamin of something <eos> more than this <eos> dreamin of leaving <eos> thats all it

<eos> so ill come clean and say that i lied <eos> i guess its ok if im hated and damned <eos> but dont go away thinking i had it planned <eos> it wasnt part of my scheme to be hateful to you <eos> did i hurt you <eos> what can i say <eos> i am guilty <eos> of walking away <eos> and the signals that i sent you <eos> i never meant to <eos> did i hurt you <eos> forgive me please <eos> i am guilty <eos> i let you believe <eos> that i loved you <eos> and i tried to <eos> still you were lied to <eos> believe me please when i say <eos> sometimes our hearts can lead us astray <eos> believe me i never knew <eos> how much of a hold i had over you <eos> and try if you can to let reason be heard <eos> dont let your anger be blind to my words <eos> dont cut me off if i try and explain it to you <eos> did i hurt you <eos> what can i say <eos> i am guilty <eos> of walking away <eos> and the signals that i sent you <eos> i never meant to <eos> did i hurt you <eos> forgive me please <eos> i am guilty <eos> i let you believe <eos> that i loved you <eos> and i tried to <eos> still you were lied to before i met you i was lost <eos> id been let down and double crossed <eos> i played the fool i played my games <eos> winning some along the way <eos> but all the same it was a shame <eos> and ive only me to blame <eos> for how id lost my way <eos> and so i locked myself inside <eos> i nursed my broken wounded pride <eos> and in my eagerness to hide <eos> i left my heart behind <eos> oh what a cost my heart got lost <eos> but now its been found <eos> you picked it off the ground <eos> and now youve come to soothe me <eos> bewitch me and amuse me <eos> how did you ever choose me <eos> and if you will excuse me <eos> id like to return <eos> the same to you <eos> its the least i can do <eos> i got you to see me through <eos> looking out for what i do <eos> springing sunshine from the skies <eos> placing rainbows in my eyes <eos> got you watching out for me <eos> making sense of what i see <eos> when my world is wearing blue <eos> i got you to see me through <eos> your tongue is wrapped in solid gold <eos> the greatest story ever told <eos> with words that dance and sing to me <eos> with eyes that shimmer like the sea <eos> a refugee who grew to be <eos> the apple of my eye <eos> i really dont know why <eos> i was so taken by your face <eos> that was the first of my mistakes <eos> and though id many more to make <eos> i am so glad that i fell down and came around <eos> to where you were <eos> at the mercy of your charms <eos> i fell into your arms <eos> and it was then it hit me <eos> that love had come to grip me <eos> of all the skills id with me <eos> id nothing to equip me <eos> with all id to do <eos> now youre here <eos> it all becomes clear <eos> i got you to see me through <eos> looking out for what i do <eos> springing sunshine from the skies <eos> placing rainbows in my eyes <eos> got you watching out for me <eos> making sense of what i see <eos> when

were fine <eos> but i knew it was a lie <eos> because i could see the lines <eos> of tiredness on your brow <eos> and the tension in your eyes <eos> ii <eos> yet to anothers face <eos> there would have been no trace <eos> of trouble in your day <eos> to one whod never seen <eos> the shadow of your dreams <eos> or the strangeness of your ways <eos> chorus <eos> to one who didnt know you <eos> or

sides <eos> i cant climb out <eos> im trapped inside <eos> its a very deep hole <eos> with very steep sides <eos> i cant climb out <eos> lord knows ive tried <eos> but im trapped inside <eos> you know ive tried <eos> but im trapped inside <eos> what is it with me <eos> i make no sense <eos> why is it <eos> i talk in future tense <eos> when im sposed to sing <eos> my voice it goes to shout <eos> "cant break out i cant break out" <eos> all my climbing up has me nowhere <eos> all of this can get too much to bear <eos> all im tryin to do is mend this beat up heart <eos> thats a start thats a start it isnt quite love <eos> it isnt quite romance <eos> but whatever it is <eos> its worth a chance <eos> and if we close our eyes <eos> we can always pretend <eos> if its not love <eos> thats not the end <eos> it isnt quite love <eos> i cannot deny <eos> but still here it is <eos> its worth a try <eos> and if i expected more <eos> life doesnt work that way <eos> so if its not love <eos> thats quite okay <eos> how often have we cried for love that died <eos> our tumbled pride on the floor <eos> so lets take care of our affair <eos> and lets not dare ask for more <eos> it isnt quite love <eos> it isnt quite romance <eos> still here it is <eos> its got to be worth a chance <eos> lets close our eyes <eos> lets pretend <eos> its not quite love <eos> youre quite a friend eleanor mcevoy

your brow <eos> and the tension in your eyes <eos> ii <eos> yet to anothers face <eos> there would have been no trace <eos> of trouble in your day <eos> to one whod never seen <eos> the shadow of your dreams <eos> or the strangeness of your ways <eos> chorus <eos> to one who didnt know you <eos> or want to touch and hold you <eos> to one who didnt need you <eos> whod never learned to read you <eos>

away my sadness <eos> a melody as potent as wine <eos> i let it sweep me out of my depression <eos> i let it point me in a new direction <eos> breathing hope on this life of mine <eos> now who could fail <eos> to let it touch the honesty within them <eos> and who could help <eos> but be comforted inside <eos> it took a harmony to heal the bad times <eos> it took a rhythm to release the sunshine <eos> even then it took me so long <eos> to break the silence id resigned my life to <eos> to break down barriers id shut my eyes to <eos> releasing me from all that was wrong <eos> now i dont try <eos> to understand the way it moves my spirit <eos> that is why <eos> spose ill never know <eos> how a subtle change of key <eos> can do these things to me <eos> and make me feel like i feel save a little of your energy <eos> spend a little of your time with me <eos> what is it that holds you here to me <eos> you must be moved by something that you see <eos> strains of magic in the moonlight hours <eos> render useless all your earthly powers <eos> souvenirs of childhood haunt your face <eos> it must be that theyve fallen from your grace <eos> and the rage burns inside <eos> like a cage thats open wide <eos> empty now but once it held <eos> the boundaries of your mind <eos> privacy and loneliness <eos> they overlap sometimes sometimes <eos> subtleties betray you everywhere <eos> thats a secret you forgot to share <eos> like how auburn still brings out your guilty streak <eos> and seemingly it adds to your mystique <eos> moody silhouettes you soon replace <eos> with swarms of passersby that flood your space <eos> your superficial scars you can conceal <eos> there are others left with wounds that will not heal <eos> and the rage burns inside <eos> like a cage thats open wide <eos> empty now but once it held <eos> the boundaries of your mind <eos> privacy and loneliness <eos> they overlap sometimes <eos> empty now but once it held <eos> the boundaries of your mind <eos> privacy and loneliness <eos> they overlap sometimes <eos> and the rage burns inside <eos> like a cage thats open wide <eos> empty now but once it held <eos> the boundaries of your mind <eos> privacy and loneliness <eos> they overlap sometimes <eos> save a little of your energy <eos> spend a little of your time with me <eos> what is it that holds you here to me sleeping close in sweetness <eos> intimate in doubt <eos> a little piece of rope around <eos> to stop us falling out <eos> and through the closed curtains <eos> a coppercoloured light <eos> and wine glasses <eos> from last night <eos> chorus <eos> is it so forgotten <eos> does it run so deep <eos> is it so forgotten <eos> like the promises we keep <eos> like the promises we keep <eos> like the promises we keep <eos> i feel so broken <eos> feel so broken <eos> i feel so broken <eos> i feel <eos> cigarette smoke drifting up <eos> to hanging plants behind <eos> particles of honesty <eos> and tenderness entwined <eos> things with you are different now <eos> and i can feel the strain <eos> what is it that protects you from this pain <eos> chorus <eos> with the days that lie ahead me <eos> im hungry to remain <eos> still i know its best to go <eos> cause nothings going to change <eos> eyes that held so much for me <eos> are holding things from me now <eos> like the harmonies <eos> that life will not allow <eos> chorus keep the weatherman sweet <eos> then begin sweeping the driveway <eos> news is that the heats <eos> coming in thursday or friday <eos> now im a little slow to see <eos> how weathermans words are gonna satisfy me <eos> words can change my point of view <eos> only if they prove to be true <eos> seven inches of rain <eos> i believe its gonna get wetter <eos> seven days of the week <eos> hopes are high its gonna get better <eos> now im not in the hoping game <eos> thats a kind of a pity and a bit of a shame <eos> but hope can be a twoedged sword <eos> and a luxury that i just cant afford <eos> twelve days snow would spread the cold around <eos> twelve days heat would melt the snow on the ground <eos> twelve days sun is what im looking for now <eos> twelve days grey whats in store <eos> keep the weatherman sweet <eos> then go off buy an umbrella <eos> go and wait for the sun <eos> go and dream beautiful weather <eos> im much too old for dreams <eos> now thats a little bit sad <eos> but

<eos> by surprise by surprise <eos> at times he knew hed failed her <eos> at times he really tried <eos> when times were worst he did his best <eos> to compromise to compromise <eos> i told her once hed break her heart <eos> but that wasnt true wasnt true <eos> cause broken things can be repaired <eos> and held onto held onto <eos> but her heart had been shattered <eos> the pieces lay inside <eos> in fragments much too tiny <eos> to recognise to recognise <eos> i look now at the weariness <eos> that lies in his eyes in his eyes <eos> and who am i to lay the blame <eos> or criticize or

and now you tell you youre leaving <eos> now you tell me you cant go on <eos> now you tell me youre leaving <eos> now you tell me <eos> now you tell me <eos> id built my walls around me <eos> out of common sense <eos> my natural inclinations <eos> were my best defence <eos> i thought my heart was safe cause <eos> i kept it out of your sight <eos> so how did you steal it from me <eos> have i no legal rights <eos> chorus <eos> i wish id never lost my head <eos> i wish id stuck to what i said <eos> it wouldnt be me here cryin now <eos> i suppose ive made my bed <eos> and about those tears i shed <eos> it shouldnt be me here cryin <eos> it shouldnt be me here cryin <eos> repeat chorus my home towns dear to me its always in my sight <eos> my citys shadows walk around in broad daylight <eos> theyll even shoot a woman down for what she writes <eos> so now you pay for civil liberty with life <eos> so hard its easy to lose hope for everyone <eos> so bad its easier to never take it on <eos> but we cant give up <eos> and we cant lose hope <eos> and we cannot hide away <eos> we can overcome <eos> but we must be strong <eos> and we must not be afraid <eos> you must not ever stop the search for peace within <eos> cause if you find it theres no better prize to win <eos> in losing peace of mind youre losing everything <eos> dont draw away from it whatever shape youre in <eos> so hard its easy to lose hope for everyone <eos> so bad its easier to never take it on <eos> but we cant give up <eos> and we cant lose hope <eos> and we cannot hide away <eos> cause we can overcome <eos> but we must be strong <eos> and we must not be afraid <eos> with all our songs and stories we have brushed aside <eos> the very nature of a beast we tried to hide <eos> with all the ugliness this city has to fight <eos> how could we leave it to a mother and a wife <eos> so hard its easy to lose hope for everyone <eos> so bad its easier to never take it on <eos> but we cant give up <eos> and we cant lose hope <eos> and we cannot hide away <eos> we can overcome <eos> but we must be strong <eos> and we must not be <eos> we must not be afraid <eos> we must not be afraid <eos> we must not be afraid <eos> we cant give up <eos> and we cant lose hope <eos> and we cannot hide away <eos> we can overcome <eos> but we must be strong <eos> and we must not be <eos> we must not be afraid <eos> we must not be afraid <eos> we must not be afraid while id like a glass of whiskey <eos> it will not change my mind <eos> so if its offered for that reason <eos> or if youre just being kind <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> i wont try to explain <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> its much too hard to explain <eos> so take some comfort in that whiskey <eos> its often been my friend <eos> and if it warms a lonely body <eos> well whos to say its bad <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> i wont try to explain <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> its much too hard to explain <eos> if kindness takes a little longer <eos> its worth the extra time <eos> some have lives so long in darkness <eos> they dont even recognise the light <eos> understand theres a child in everyone <eos> we should watch what we say <eos> everyone has their battles and their pain <eos> hidden somewhere away <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> i wont try to explain <eos> i will go to my own sweet bed tonight <eos> its much too hard to explain dont need to kiss you <eos> though i know it would be good <eos> dont need to hug you <eos> but sometimes i wish i could <eos> dont mean to do with you <eos> what just would not be right <eos> just need the thought of you <eos> to get me through the night <eos> just the thought of you <eos>

<eos> youre sending your love to war <eos> with a doctor and a locked up door <eos> you only learned to pack it up a year ago at the corner store <eos> where the bandage made your blood run boiled <eos> and youre running cause youre so hardcore <eos> chours <eos> and all the ladies dance and swoon <eos> to the tango tune <eos> by the big pi moon <eos> oh while your brothers warn each other with their lavish lyric tunes <eos> oh lover never loved me though i do <eos> and said the doctor to your heart you never ever should have come so far <eos> you couldnt blame it on your new guitar <eos> you wouldnt play it at the whisky bar <eos> and its been years running up and down the wrong side of <eos> the streets you lived on were not made for love <eos> write a letter send a war cry dove <eos> chorus <eos> yes i do have your picture in my car <eos> where i dream that im driving fast and far <eos> and i do want you badly like i said so <eos> oh whoa when i dreamed how i loved you soft and slow <eos> but never mind the invitation it was all a form of so and so <eos> and weve both had enough of stop and go <eos> and now you wish youd never said hello <eos> until were back into the station where the radio is blaring on <eos> and all the war brides sing their soldiers songs <eos> the night is sure dear but the love is long <eos> chorus oh you wont find me in the arms of strangers <eos> laughing and drinking like a big parader <eos> i dont posses the mind to over matters <eos> of the money kind <eos> mine just scatters <eos> and you wont find me <eos> no you wont find me <eos> pick me up from my over coat <eos> ive been wearing that over coat for seven years <eos> long long years <eos> if something dont pick me ill disappear <eos> and you wont find me <eos> no you wont find me <eos> and you wont find me <eos> in the magazines <eos> thumbing my way through those hip cat scenes <eos> rambling on <eos> coat tails long <eos> waltzing my tears to a tom jones song <eos> no you wont find me <eos> no you wont find me <eos> that sun come up every day <eos> just to show me how its done i think <eos> oh but i get things in my own way <eos> when that sun goes away i drink <eos> drinking to the moon and the stars <eos> all those names on the boulevard <eos> oh where you wont find me <eos> de de de de de <eos> da dad a dad a da da <eos> de de de de de de <eos> and you wont find me at the pearly gates <eos> those boys dont make many mistakes <eos> big old scroll <eos> heads gunna role <eos> i gave away my heart <eos> im going to keep my soul <eos> oh you wont find me

foundation <eos> of shadow of song <eos> and raddled the windows <eos> and the tiny regrets <eos> and the tiny glasses houses <eos> that i tried to forget <eos> drink til your sleeping <eos> i love you that way <eos> like we are all babies <eos> all our beds are unmade <eos> no memory has molded <eos> enough to forget <eos> and our tiny glass houses <eos> are not built for us yet <eos> takes all of the courage <eos> and none of the pride <eos> to stand in the threshold <eos> to sit down inside <eos> where we are not babies <eos> no we are not new <eos> and our tiny glass houses <eos> with the beautiful view <eos> theres a crack in my memory <eos> where a funeral parade <eos> rolls through the doorway <eos> that my memory made <eos> and funeral marches <eos> to its funeral sounds <eos> and the tiny glass houses <eos> are all tumbling down <eos> and tiny glass houses <eos> are all tumbling down <eos> and tiny glass houses <eos> are all tumbling down hardest hearts if you ever let go <eos> well come together on the renegade road <eos> lead you back to the wreckage of change <eos> build your bridges learn your name <eos> cross the river in three good strides <eos> left the company wild with pride <eos> river ribbon all around your legs <eos> gripped the surface and you turned your head <eos> jump the line and turn the key <eos> lose your guard believe in me <eos> i can love you best of all <eos> i am the wrecking ball <eos> hallelujah changed your tune <eos> the sky was open for you all too soon <eos> left the cradle in the rockin wind <eos> ran from nothing like its everything <eos> night can turn the mirror on <eos> saw your face and it looked all wrong <eos> where are the eyes that you looked out from <eos> two young coins in the rising sun <eos> so you curb and then the tragedy <eos> you put your faith in a reverie <eos> all good soldiers stand for thee <eos> losing battles in front row seats <eos> as your shoulders curl and bend with time <eos> then love and hatred must combine <eos> you turn the page to reconcile <eos> you see ive loved you all the while julia queen of hearts <eos> pleads to play the part <eos> the casualty of everything <eos> the fatal arrow thru the lark <eos> and the nightingale <eos> with his offering <eos> please not her heart <eos> the hum and ring <eos> of the broken strings <eos> cannot contain what the dont discard <eos> and it wont remain <eos> although it comes for her again <eos> keys to kingdoms battles bring <eos> tho they wont remain <eos> and tho they seem to understand <eos> waves of change to a glass of sand <eos> waves of change to a glass of sand <eos> julia pages have been turned <eos> of a book of poems <eos> your lover learned <eos> did you praise the line and blame the words <eos> for if you have taken <eos> every phrase <eos> and bled them all of rage <eos> and youve mistaken <eos> julia queen of hearts <eos> who will never rein <eos> and it wont remain <eos> although it comes for her again <eos> keys to kingdoms battles bring <eos> tho they wont remain <eos> and tho they seem to understand <eos> waves of change to a glass of sand <eos> waves of change to a glass of sand feast on the labor of your mind <eos> and you wont go hungry and you wont go blind <eos> feed on the pictures of all youve left behind <eos> knowing they are just pictures still and sad and refined <eos> its a mad world to be stuck on the livin <eos> and its a heart breaker to succumb to forgettin <eos> i keep wishing for something that gets in my way <eos> and my path is a jungle its got too much to say <eos> outlive me outlive me <eos> i love you too much <eos> rubies and emeralds <eos> sapphires and such <eos> outlive me outlive me <eos> i love you too much <eos> coal into diamonds <eos> ashes and dust <eos> there is a fire in place of a stone <eos> softens the letters and it takes you back home <eos> where once it was written the lines we obeyed <eos> now tenderly questions the choices weve made now that your darlin keeps you home <eos> there goes the best war weve ever had <eos> now that nobodys all alone <eos> well turn forgiveness to forget <eos> if youre in town youll look me up <eos> and dance the days into the cups <eos> and you will talk of golden river flow <eos> and given you enough <eos> bye bye years <eos> of deals and dolls <eos> bye bye montreal <eos> what wicked patterns we succumb <eos> from the warnings we have run <eos> now from a figure we have cut the mold <eos> and filled the stadium hounds are broodin in my bones <eos> but i am a good dog runnin halfway home <eos> hear the lonely promenade <eos> come to nurse the tender terrways <eos> all hands on a grain of sand <eos> half smallest things are the high demand <eos> i can only serenade <eos> and wait my turn to burn or fade <eos> all colors you can see <eos> cover the borders of a masterpiece <eos> time can paint the best of me <eos> over the unclear eyes of memory <eos> cover love from sympathy <eos> be my maker set me free <eos> truer hearts could not contain <eos> how i cover love but i have not changed when you abandon all manner of me <eos> the concrete and angels ashes <eos> with nothing to serve but your own memory <eos> bring them the rain the last of the tidings <eos> tied to the arrows fired off to loves lost regard <eos> lovers dont love you <eos> and silver dont lead to your door <eos> will you take comfort <eos> that you have been taken before <eos> oh every intention has paved every path <eos> they followed through driftwood and moor <eos> what haunts you the most only lives to outlast <eos> cast off the best the rest of all sorrows <eos> left to the gallows the palace of all that you are <eos> have i been good to you <eos> blue in the shadow of gold <eos> blue in the phrases of letting go hello its me the mistress <eos> is there anybody home <eos> cause the last place i should be is sittin here alone <eos> all i ask for is forgiveness <eos> if youve got some give it here <eos> you dont act much like you need it <eos> you dont look much like you care <eos> and will you need me in the summer <eos> will you need me in the spring <eos> i believe my life is ending i dont know where to begin <eos> ive got a page in my back pocket of the seven deadly sins <eos> and its dragging me around among the needles and the pins <eos> and i dont need to take a breather <eos> im on the outside looking out <eos> yeah i dont need to see your papers <eos> cause i know what youre about <eos> you had me by the bible and you had me by the belt <eos> and you had me from the instant my cold love began to melt <eos> and then you praise me for my inspiration <eos> asked me for an explanation <eos> followed up with hesitation <eos> fit my primal expectation <eos> i dont care but i dont mind <eos> you can call me any time <eos> you can holler through the fortress <eos> and kick me out of line <eos> i dont expect it from the grief that gathers in my head <eos> i like suspended disbelief <eos> i like to spend the day in bed <eos> i like to spend the nights in heaven <eos> hanging with the dead <eos> you know judas and his women and the voices in my head <eos> ive got my eyes upon the mirror <eos> ive got my hands up in the air <eos> i confess to my distress yeah i great crazier each year <eos> you know id change it if i could you know i like to say that i would <eos> but theres a war between the parts of me <eos> the evil and the good <eos> and you try and stop me im on fire <eos> it doesnt look that way <eos> you know i used to be a liar <eos> but livings set me straight <eos> i dont come with no disclaimer im like everybody else <eos> we keep our demons on the burner and our morals on the shelf <eos> and nobody asks for my opinion because you dont want to hear <eos> i swear im only human wishing i could disappear <eos> and you must think its an illusion that i like to live in fear <eos> of a probable solution of why the devil put me here <eos> and now no judgement call will kill me <eos> just makes me close my eyes <eos> and i sink into the slumber to the prison of my mind <eos> where id love to introduce you <eos> if you found a way inside <eos> you could sell me retribution and totally demystify <eos> until i wonder how i got here <eos> until i dont know who to be <eos> is it better to be grounded <eos> is it better to be free <eos> am i better off without you <eos> am i happier alone <eos> hello its me the mistress could you please pick up the phone wicked the weather can empty the heart <eos> sunsets are poetry falling apart <eos> pitchin and weavin down gottingen road <eos> i never loved you i know <eos> but dance with my shadow on into the bar <eos> midnight is marked by brokendown

unholy ritual <eos> the dead crawl from their earthen prisons <eos> bodies decayed beyond recognition they amass <eos> prepare nightmares from the darkest recess of your imagination <eos> tormented by lusty unquenchable thirst for blood <eos> they are driven on loosed of the shackles <eos> and free of the grave their vengeance knows no bounds <eos> raging hunger pierces the black in the flicker of their morbid gaze <eos> creatures of evil spawned and spewn from the depths of hell <eos> moaning with desire for the flesh of the unsuspecting victims of their attack <eos> wanton destruction burns in their hearts as they enter the land of the living <eos> rise frenzied lust for flesh <eos> your blood seeps through my chest <eos> you are the living dead <eos> storming gods planet earth <eos> shambling gait downcast eyes retrogress from the grave <eos> empithely spewing pus from their lifeless veins <eos> decayed legions cast from hades rotting lungs exposed <eos> maggots feed and the smell of death overcomes and cripples all <eos> lifeless emissaries of evil crazed <eos> by the pleasure of their vile inhumanities <eos> wretched outcasts of the underworld <eos> condemned to roam the earth and kill all that lives <eos> they will march for satandemonsguardians of the damned <eos> vilehauntingsoulless creatures satanslegions of the dead <eos> they will march for

riding the cursed wings of grief <eos> silence <eos> hear sorrow laughing <eos> hear joy crying <eos> ride the black wings of sorrow <eos> silence <eos> hear death screaming <eos> hear life dying <eos> after going through <eos> the darkest nightmares <eos> i could only trust my self <eos> for the ones who loved me <eos> will be happy to hate me <eos> dont just stand there <eos> my black tree withers <eos> take me away to the forest of believes <eos> where the roots will rest <eos> and i can have serenity <eos> i want to feel the black rivers water <eos> the current gliding me <eos> towards eternity <eos> trashing whats left <eos> ripping biting and cutting my flesh <eos> destroying this shell <eos> to finally escape my private hell i play and sing <eos> dawn <eos> when they ask

transcribed by iiti all of my life ive heard stories told <eos> of a treasure more precious than silver and gold <eos> i thought that id known love a time or two <eos> till i found a heart so loving and true <eos> chorus <eos> i could fall all over and over again <eos> can you hear my heart saying it too <eos> i could fall all over and over again <eos> in love with a girl like you <eos> youve been my by my side through the good and the tears <eos> your faith from the heart held on through the years <eos> when things would get cloudy youd help me to see <eos> this love isnt blind weve got all that we need <eos> repeat chorus the skies are blue but i still hear thunder <eos> the skies are clear but theres lightning under my skin <eos> its gonna rain again and when the rains come down <eos> ill be on that road again <eos> warriors will ride <eos> on their painted horses <eos> blessed by the wind <eos> and the unseen forces above <eos> they will ride on as one <eos> they will brave the storm <eos> till the rains are over and done <eos> ride on crazy horse <eos> take me to the hills <eos> beyond the battle where the waters are still <eos> where its so quiet you can hear the children run <eos> far away from the sound of the gun <eos> these are the feathers of a golded eagle <eos> these are the feathers of an ancient people <eos> you must you must set my people free <eos> never hold me down for the eagle must fly free <eos> warriors will ride on their painted horses <eos> bless by the wind and the unseen forces above <eos> they will ride on as one <eos> they will brave the storm <eos> till the rains are over and done theres no reason <eos> for fighting this way <eos> theres no rhyme in the <eos> words that we say <eos> the sun is gonna rise <eos> the sun is gonna rise again <eos> the sun is gonna rise <eos> the sun is gonna rise again <eos> theres no beauty <eos> in thoughts that betray <eos> theres no peace <eos> when your lifes gone astray <eos> good and evil <eos> fighting for your soul <eos> we are children <eos> standing in the coldest night every now and then i forget about you <eos> all the things you said the things we used to do <eos> then the sun goes down and the night sets in <eos> and in this lonely town your memory never ends <eos> seasons may pass me by year after year <eos> but this love will never die and ill stilll be here <eos> when you need someone to care <eos> someone to come home to <eos> till then ill wait for you <eos> out in colorado or down in tennesee <eos> it doesnt matter where you are your homes still here with me <eos> so ill keep on prayin that someday youllfind <eos> what youve been earching for is what you left behind if i took away your shelter put you on the street <eos> if i took away your table and chairs threw away your meat <eos> stole away your wife and child see how lonesome you would be <eos> is that what it would take for you to listen to me <eos> if i took away your legs and you could never walk <eos> if i took away your words and you could never talk <eos> blinded your eyes and you could never see <eos> locked you up in shackles and you were no longer free <eos> is that what it would take for you to listen to me <eos> listen to me i am the thunder you refuse to hear <eos> i am the rock you cant hide under <eos> you have nothing more to fear <eos> this is a time for healing the scars upon the land <eos> my son listen to me <eos> if i gave you a blanket you could be warm <eos> if i gave you a roof to stay under <eos> would that save you from the storm <eos> gave you all the money you could ever spend <eos> do you think that means your troubles would finally end <eos> is that what it would take for you to listen to me <eos> listen to me i am the thunder you refuse to hear <eos> i am the rock you cant hide under <eos> you have nothing more to fear <eos> this is a time for healing the scars upon the land <eos> my son listen to me <eos> i give you the seed dig your roots deep in the land <eos> heres a blade to turn the soil grow somethin in the sand <eos> i give you all me blessings my blood runs through your veins <eos> i will stand beside you even when it rains <eos> my son listen to me <eos> listen to me i am the thunder you refuse to hear <eos> i am the rock you cant hide under <eos> you have nothing more to fear <eos> this is a time for healing the scars upon the land <eos> my son listen to me instrumental instrumental far across the mississippi and out on the open plains <eos> in an oklahoma cow town where the sky begins to rain <eos> in a dusty rundown honky tonk sits a drifting tumbleweed <eos> thumbing through some magazine that he cant even read <eos> now tumbleweed remembers how the west was won and lost <eos> the homestead act and the dust bowl everybody paid the cost <eos> and the great white father promised to treat his children all the same <eos> back when indian territory was oklahomas name <eos> oh tumbleweed keep rollin he just roams from town to town <eos> it aint easy for a halfbreed kid to try and settle down <eos> tumbleweed keep rollin he cant find no place to rest <eos> yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west <eos> well his boot heals tap in time to an old flat top guitar <eos> and hes a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart <eos> and his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills <eos> he makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill <eos> when he starts to picking that old guitar you know the people turn and stare <eos> when he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells theres magic in the air <eos> cause his song can heal your wounded heart he can set you spirit free <eos> he can raise you hopes to be the very best that you can be <eos> oh tumbleweed keep rollin he just roams from town to town <eos> it aint easy for a halfbreed kid to try and settle down <eos> tumbleweed keep rollin he cant find no place to rest <eos> yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west <eos> so if you cross the mississippi you head out on the open plain <eos> and you pass through oklahoma and the sky begins to rain <eos> and you feeling kind of rootless you cant find no place to rest <eos> just remember tumbleweed hes the spirit of the west <eos> oh the desert blows old tumbleweed like some spirit of the west ridin on to el paso followin the rodeo <eos> when she stole my heart under a desert moon <eos> in a bordertown down in mexico where all the lonely cowboys go <eos> stands a mission church at the end of a crowded street <eos> was there i first caught sight of her alone my heart began to stir <eos> she was kneeling there at the foot of a painted cross <eos> on the borderline <eos> crossing the heartlands again and again <eos> on the borderline <eos> if lightning would strike me id never know when <eos> my heart must always remain on the borderline <eos> had to stay another day if only just to find a way to meet that girl who prays by the lonesome grave <eos> they say she lost her only one to a battle of the blazing guns <eos> now she cries each night and her tears stain the desert sand <eos> she vowed to never give her heart to someone else if they should part <eos> ill never meet those eyes to tell her i love her so <eos> im on the borderline <eos> crossing the heartlands again and again <eos> on the borderline <eos> if lightning would strike me id never know when <eos> my heart must always remain on the borderline garbage fires worn out tires <eos> dull jackknives broken lives <eos> starts and stops at old pawn shops <eos> boys first fish drunkards wish <eos> thoughts of war behind a motel door <eos> strangers touch on a broken crutch <eos> old man sing under an eagles wing <eos> cigarette spark stray dog bark <eos> as long as the grasses grow <eos> and the four winds blow <eos> i feel your prayers from home <eos> in this pile of stones <eos> old bike frames the candles flame <eos> high school dances never had a chance <eos> fly off in a rage like a bird in a cage <eos> baptized in the water death of my father <eos> sun goes down on this part of town <eos> boxers fist junkies wrist <eos> deserted tracks i aint goin back <eos> buffalo bones old grave stones <eos> as long as the grasses grow <eos> and the four winds blow <eos> i feel your prayers from home <eos> in this pile of stones stones stones there is anger there is rage <eos> nameless victims of the age <eos> hear their voices hear their cries <eos> face to face and eye to eye <eos> where there is promise there is hope <eos> there is you <eos> where there is kindness there is love <eos> there is you <eos> greedy tyrants using force <eos> vengeful souls without remorse <eos> spreading hate spreading lies <eos> icy fire behind their eyes <eos> where there is conscience there is truth <eos> there is you <eos> where there is someone with a need <eos> there is you <eos> you are a rock <eos> you are a shield <eos> you are a flower in the field <eos> you are a shelter in the storm <eos> making ovens building bombs <eos> when will we question what is wrong <eos> take a stand draw the line <eos> will we die before our time <eos> where there is grace there is beauty <eos> there is you <eos> where there is peace there is life <eos> there is you <eos> where there is grace there is beauty <eos> there is you <eos> where there is peace there is life <eos> there is you yeah <eos> you are a rock <eos> you are a shield <eos> you are a flower in the field <eos> you are a shelter in the storm instrumental instrumental put on your best new dress <eos> and let your hair hand down <eos> leave behind that kitchen mess <eos> were going out on the town <eos> ill put my new boots on <eos> brush off my hat <eos> and like the wind were gone <eos> cant do better than that <eos> and then well dance the blues <eos> dance the blues <eos> dance the blues away <eos> tonight is yours and mine <eos> like old times <eos> lets dance the blues away <eos> i asked you for your hand <eos> seven yeas gone by <eos> back when we used to dance <eos> lets give it one more try <eos> each day brings new romance <eos> that our hearts cant hide <eos> under the moon youll dance <eos> in my arms tonight <eos> out in this crazy world <eos> things can go wrong <eos> ive got one and only girl <eos> and were still going strong instrumental i was lookin back on faded dreams from yesturday <eos> like a brush from my past they painted the evening sky <eos> but the currents so strong i couldnt hold on <eos> they kept rollin by <eos> and all the colors bled into a river of time <eos> the innocent child fades into the mist on the river of time <eos> an angry young man is shaking his fist on the river of time <eos> roll on river of time rage on river of time <eos> there are faces and places i hold sacred <eos> some ive passed along the way <eos> some live on in memory some ive passed along the way <eos> with the rain from a storm a river is born <eos> winding down to the sea and the river of time <eos> keeps on rollin thru eternity <eos> the angry young man learns how to forgive <eos> on the river of time <eos> he holds an innocent child in his arms <eos> on the river of time <eos> roll on river of time <eos> rage on river of time look for me on the mountain <eos> cry to me on the winds <eos> call for me in the canyons <eos> and you will find me again <eos> come to me with your sorrow <eos> come to me with your pain <eos> i have seen your tomorrow <eos> but tonight brings the rain <eos> after the storm is over <eos> and the rains have come and gone <eos> after the storm is over <eos> i was there all along <eos> reach for me when youre broken <eos> when the journey is too long <eos> when all your worry is unspoken <eos> for in your weakness i am strong <eos> call to me from the darkness <eos> turn to me when you thirst <eos> come to me when youre homeless <eos> then the last will be first in the beartooth mountains where the twin peaks touch the sky <eos> theres a homemade cabin out of sight from tourists eyes <eos> and inside lightin up a fire to fight the cold <eos> lives a miners daughter with a heart as pure as gold <eos> shes as gentle flowin as the sweet grass on the plains <eos> and i need her lovin like the forest needs the rain <eos> like a rollin river she just swept my heart away <eos> now im out here driftin when i know i shouldve stayed <eos> oh that west wind is callin in skies of turqoise blue <eos> and the creek is still runnin like quicksilver dew <eos> she was all that i needed why did i ever leave <eos> oh her voice voice on the westwind is still callin me <eos> theres a cold wind blowin through this mountain pass tonight <eos> as i hold her memory to my heart it dont seem right <eos> just an empty cabin with a lock left on the door <eos> now i realize that ive lost the girl for sure <eos> so i went up to red lodge to see if they might know <eos> all the townfolk said that she left sometime ago <eos> she just up and married with a nice young city man <eos> i was a fool to let her slip right through my hands instrumental instrumental deep in the heart of a city night <eos> theres a young girl dancing free <eos> twiling in circle by the front porch light <eos> out on the street of dreams out on the street of dreams <eos> further down theres a family <eos> theres a young couple in their teens <eos> their baby smiling at a barking dog <eos> it was down on the street of dreams <eos> there on the street of dreams <eos> and they still go where they want to <eos> and the will be who the will be <eos> cause there are no walls around their hearts <eos> on the street of dreams their on the street of dreams <eos> two older men talk of days gone by <eos> and of a world theyve never seen <eos> their hearts are young but theyve traveled far <eos> on down the street of dreams their on the street of dreams <eos> and they still go where they want to <eos> and the will be who the will be <eos> cause there are no walls around their hearts <eos> on the street of dreams <eos> and you can go where you want to <eos> you can be who you will be <eos> cause there are no walls around your heart <eos> on the street of dreams <eos> and you can go where you want to <eos> you can be who you will be <eos> cause there are no walls around your heart <eos> on the street of dreams were on the street of dreams <eos> deep in the heart of a city night <eos> theres a young girl dancing free <eos> twiling in circle by the front porch light <eos> out on the street of dreams out on the street of dreams <eos> there on the street of dreams <eos> were on the street of dreams instrumental i praise you for the rivers the mountains and the streams <eos> i praise you for the eagle the visions and the dreams <eos> i praise all your creations the mountains and the streams <eos> i praise you for the eagle the visions and the dreams <eos> i praise you for my children the mountains and the streams <eos> i praise you for the eagle the visions and the dreams <eos> i praise you for my people the mountains and the

we feel good in our hearts <eos> wawanon we thank you <eos> maunekakosawtewa we have everything <eos> mahmawkohneno our father up above out beyond the broken billboards and the signs along the road <eos> theres a trail your heart must follow no one but you could ever know <eos> where the winds and the coyote sing a song youve never heard <eos> from a place thats long forgotten but youll remember every word <eos> chorus <eos> in a world thats always changing find the things that stay the same <eos> like the moon and stars that guide you out across the sweeping plain <eos> keep your eye on the horizon when you cross that great divide <eos> all you have is whats inside you when you take that lonesome ride <eos> forever ride forever ride forever ride <eos> so go to sleep now little brother dream of red tails in the west <eos> i know until you find your way there your crazy soul will never rest <eos> well chase the horses in the springtime when the desert flowers bloom <eos> you may never hear my footstep but i will always be with you <eos> repeat chorus a tall black cowboy hat pulled down low to hide his eyes <eos> while lines of weekend window shoppers just kept rollin by <eos> i spotted him from my old truck as he stood out in the crowd <eos> he was a little more than twice my age but he still looked strong and proud <eos> hadnt seen my uncle now since i was seventeen <eos> and the stories of the wild wild west kept comin back to me <eos> he didnt say too much just tipped his has as he closed the old truck door <eos> and i knew that this trip down highway would bring me so much more <eos> where the old man and the little boy could see things eye to eye <eos> he took me back to a place in time where legends never die <eos> his hands and face were lined and weathered they told stories of their own <eos> his skin as red as desert clay his eyes as black as coal <eos> he was a cowboy and an indian just a little bit of both <eos> for years of working the ranches and rodeos he didnt have much to show <eos> then he closed his eyes and spoke to me his voice was like the wind <eos> and that truck turned into a raging steed so he could ride again <eos> he grabbed the colors from the sky put them in his hands <eos> sprinkled them across the road like grains of colored sand instrumental some are born to wealth and given shelter from the storm <eos> some were always held and had a fire to keep them warm <eos> some are born to poverty with no roof above their head <eos> some are facing suicide and wishin they were dead <eos> there are those with flowing rivers right outside their door <eos> refugees in boats who may never reach the shore <eos> some pray for rain and the pay for it in blood <eos> when it rains for forty days we are all victims of the flood <eos> somewhere a brave heart must survive <eos> yes someday the truth will bury the lie <eos> yah somewhere a brave heart must survive <eos> too many here been prisoners deserving to be free <eos> too many in the darkness and they have no eyes to see <eos> in the middle of the night they are taken from their homes <eos> and they dig a common grave to cover up their flesh and bones <eos> but a new day in dawning for the beggars and the blind <eos> for those who have suffered and were always left behind <eos> but the chains will be broken and the fences will come down <eos> and we will walk as brothers once again on the sacred ground <eos> somewhere a brave heart must survive <eos> yes someday the truth will bury the lie <eos> yah somewhere a brave heart must survive instrumental well i

rollin on down to san anton <eos> when i was just a baby mama told me son <eos> she said always be a good boy dont you ever play with guns <eos> but i shoot a man in reno just to what he die <eos> when i hear that lonesome whistle blow i hang my head down and cry <eos> well i bet theres rich folk eating in some fancy dining car <eos> probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars <eos> well i

<eos> where the mountain lion lays down with the lamb <eos> i wanna stand where god is praised <eos> i wanna ride across the plains to the promised land <eos> chorus <eos> where im going dont need to raise your voice <eos> no starvation have plenty to eat <eos> no guns no wars no hateful noise <eos> just a victory dance well never taste defeat <eos> where theres nothin done or said that cant be forgiven <eos> where every step you take is on sacred ground <eos> walk away from death into the land of the living <eos> where all the lost tribes are finally found <eos> chorus x <eos> as theyre finally coming home well they put geronimo in jail down south <eos> where he couldnt look the gift horse in the mouth <eos> sargent sargent dont you fear <eos> theres something wrong with that

on his hands and it wont come clean <eos> no where to run no where to turn <eos> the fires of rage begin to burn <eos> you cant go home and he cant go on <eos> his flesh is weak and his spirits gone <eos> now hes behind a prison wall <eos> he doesnt have the will to live <eos> he says its all his fathers fault <eos> he taught his son the way to live <eos> he was unable to forgive <eos> she wore his ring for thirty years <eos> and one night he confessed his darkest fears <eos> hed been unfaithful hed been untrue <eos> what could she say what could she do <eos> no where to run no where to turn <eos> the fires of rage begin to burn <eos> she cant go home and she cant go on <eos> her flesh is weak and her spirits gone <eos> he had betrayed her with a kiss <eos> killed her desires her will to live <eos> and who was blinded what did they miss <eos> will she be able to forgive are we able to forgive <eos> seven blue stones in the desert sand <eos> a shiny gun in a young thiefs hand <eos> a stolen car a broken dream <eos> blood on his hands and it wont come clean every word that you have spoken <eos> and the promises you made <eos> all the laws that you have broken <eos> some days these debts must be repaid <eos> every stone will be turned over <eos> and we will see your ugly past <eos> you stole the land youll never own her <eos> these evil ways they will not last <eos> someday their souls will be set free <eos> and their voices will be heard <eos> as far as every eye can see <eos> they will have the final word <eos> for every weed in every garden <eos> and all the crops that ever died <eos> while you were full and they were starvin <eos> my children will not de denied <eos> every fire that you have started <eos> every fist you threw my way <eos> for all the families you have parted <eos> the innocent will have their day <eos> someday their should will be set free <eos> and their voices will be heard <eos> as far as i can see <eos> they will have the final word so many hills that we have climbed <eos> so many trails we left behind <eos> so many songs that i forget <eos> the journey isnt over yet <eos> through all the years ive watched you grow <eos> the little secrets we both know <eos> how i held you when you slept <eos> ive always felt the tears you wept <eos> there is a reason for your laughter <eos> there is a reason for your pain <eos> there is a dream youre chasing after <eos> there are some things youll well never change <eos> so many rivers we have crossed <eos> the love we found the love we lost <eos> the steps we made i will retrace <eos> the broken memories cant erase clyde woke up real early while edna was still asleep <eos> got dressed and had some coffee then found his set of keys <eos> he pulled on his levi jacket he headed for the door <eos> the kitchen smelled like dinner from the night before <eos> a rumbling exhaust pipe woke edna from her sleep <eos> she stumbled like a drunkard yelling clyde you wait for me <eos> but clyde was going nowhere just sitting in his truck <eos> staring with a poker face like hed run out of luck <eos> chorus <eos> cause any fool wouldve turned and run <eos> any fool wouldve walked away <eos>

the whippoorwill one night <eos> and went out to find where he was singing he had to <eos> walk quite a ways through a big field because the <eos> song of the whippoorwill carried so well in the wind he <eos> sound much closer then he really was and on the way <eos> the boy found a well worn trail so he stayed on it for a <eos> while and sitting in the middle of the trail was coyote <eos> and coyote was singing too he turned and saw the <eos> boy and he said "why are you follow me" the boy <eos> was frightened and said "well the trail you made <eos> happened to be a short and easy way through this <eos> field then coyote asked "well if your not following <eos> me then why are you here" "well i heard the beautiful <eos> song of the whippoorwill and wanted to watch him <eos> sing" "well do you not think my songs are beautiful" <eos> said coyote "oh" said the boy "there good but i hear <eos> you all the time i much prefer the songs of the <eos> whippoorwill" this made coyote furious and he was <eos> jealous of the whippoorwills song he said "listen to <eos> my night song you might like this one" and he pulled <eos> back his head and yodeled out a tune the boy <eos> covered his ears and politely said "thank you for the <eos> song but i must be going now" "well" coyote said "i <eos> can show you a short cut to the whippoorwill boy and <eos> where he sings is just over there" pointing his claw <eos> smiling out of the side of his mouth the boy paused <eos> looked around he knew the night was passing fast so <eos> he agreed to follow coyote but coyotes trail was <eos> rough and rocky and the boy fell in quite a few <eos> gopher holes along the way coyote turned around <eos> and laughed and he yelled to the boy "were almost <eos> there hurry up" coyote was at a full trot but the boy <eos> had just fallen again and hurt his knee and by the time <eos> he got to the place where the whippoorwill had been <eos> singing all night it was morning whippoorwill was <eos> gone and so was coyote in fact he could hear <eos> coyotes songs in another field so the boy turned and <eos> headed for home covered with burrs misq bites and a <eos> skinned up knee and it was many summers later <eos> when the boy became a wiser man and he realized <eos> there are no shortcuts to find something you really <eos> love but there are many trails in this life so you must <eos> stay true to your path and always keep and eye out <eos> for coyote in saturday night the love seems spreading all the world <eos> so why you feel so sad just take it easy and get back <eos> why this

earth good will to men <eos> and in despair i bowed my head <eos> "there is no peace on earth" i said <eos> "for hate is strong and mocks the song <eos> of peace on earth good will to men" sing now a

<eos> it started the night that we might <eos> she kissed me and vowed she would care <eos> i traded the gold in pocket <eos> to fondle the curls in her hair <eos> she lied when she told me she loved

shining glory shore <eos> my heavn my home forever more there was a little railroad train with loads and loads of toys <eos> all starting out to find a home with little girls and boys <eos> and as that little railroad train began to chug along <eos> the little engine up in front was heard to sing this song <eos> choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo i feel so good today <eos> oh clear the track oh clickety clack ill go my merry way <eos> the little train went roaring on so fast it seemed to fly <eos> until it reached a mountain rising almost to the sky <eos> the little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away <eos> but halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say <eos> i cant go on i cant go on im weary as can be <eos> i cant go on i cant go on this job is not for me <eos> the toys got out to push but all in vain alas alack <eos> and then a great big engine came a whistling down the track <eos> they asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side <eos> but with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied <eos> dont bother me dont bother me to pull the likes of you <eos> dont bother me dont bother me ive better things to do <eos> the toys all

slow <eos> for courtings a pleasure and partings a grief <eos> and a false hearted lover is worse than a thief <eos> for a thief will just rob you and take all you save <eos> but a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave <eos> and the grave will decay you and turn you to dust <eos> not one girl in a hundred a poor boy can trust <eos> theyll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies <eos> than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies <eos> so come all your maidens and listen to me <eos> never place your affections on a green willow tree <eos> for the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die <eos> youll all be forsaken and never know why sitting by the roadside on a summers day <eos> chatting with my messmates passing time away <eos> laying in the shadows

happy to be here <eos> looking at the leaves of time <eos> in my mind <eos> in my mind <eos> plans are real <eos> ploughing out <eos> across the fields <eos> holding court <eos> for miles around <eos> finding out <eos> its only sound <eos> once i heard the handle <eos> its part strong out the tangos <eos> the gentle gentle shift <eos> sent toward him tender drift <eos> and on the worst day of his life <eos> hed still love more things than i like <eos> taping melodies of times <eos> in his mind <eos> in his mind <eos> plans are real <eos> ploughing out <eos> across the fields <eos> holding court <eos> for miles around <eos> finding out <eos> its only sound grow your hair longer <eos> its easy to in summer <eos> when the days fold under <eos> if it pours in the daytime <eos> well have to stay indoors <eos> ill milk the time you sat with me <eos> what i hoped for most <eos> was to be his greatest host <eos> hed make my hands his home <eos> the man i wanted <eos> where is the pain i weeped <eos> how does the opposite feel <eos> well you will never show me when i saw you die the death <eos> whilst beating animal <eos> i ran to approach the poachers nest <eos> to strip them of their epaulet <eos> you really are the maddest beast <eos> ive ever seen before <eos> three hundred pounds wrapped in my cave <eos> we going to an island <eos> i packed you up with trophy bones <eos> and bridged you on the peak <eos> we stayed to watch the ships come in <eos> and drank to when the chase felt good <eos> i really could not leave him there <eos> they put him through the mill <eos> i rode back home to tell my friends <eos> the moon it makes the wine taste sweet a great man had a dream <eos> ending in a murder scene <eos> and im not such a man <eos> never been so brave or grand <eos> but little one <eos> i had a dream <eos> about a nation that became <eos> a dazzling sky <eos> the heroes of youth <eos> a burning ache <eos> resurrecting truth <eos> my dreamy one <eos> i had a dream <eos> about a nation that became <eos> a guiding hand <eos> wipes the greed away <eos> a whistle blown <eos> digs corruptions grave <eos> my dreamy one <eos> i had a dream <eos> about a nation that became <eos> a jasmine wind <eos> turns the air so sweet <eos> a cleansing spring <eos> washes stained elites <eos> oh little one <eos> i had a dream <eos> about a nation that became <eos> a brilliant star <eos> bove a poor mans house <eos> a treasure chest <eos> let the magic out <eos> my dreamy one <eos> i had a dream <eos> oh dreamy one oh dreamy one <eos> i had a dream <eos> this shadow of a man <eos> had a dream he cant forget <eos> a shadow with a dream <eos> a nation changed a nation blessed <eos> and let us sing <eos> lux et veritas victoria <eos> lets make our dreams come true <eos> lux et veritas victoria <eos> and the dream begins with you <eos> my dreamy one <eos> i had a dream <eos> a nation changed <eos> a nation blessed if i could divide the smell of flowers <eos> id send some to the falsely charged <eos> locked in prison cells <eos> send some to the lonely seniors <eos> trapped in apartment hells <eos> send some to the weary miners <eos> sweating beneath the ground <eos> send some to the invisible people <eos> hauling our garbage round <eos> some answers in life are so easy <eos> like zero plus zero is none <eos> but how do we divide the smell of flowers <eos> so their fragrance is shared by everyone <eos> if i could divide the smell of flowers <eos> id pass some to the frightened animals <eos> caged against their wills <eos> pass some to the dying birds <eos> choking on oil spills <eos> pass some to the angry kids <eos> sniffing up airplane glue <eos> pass some to the crying widow <eos> missing the love she knew <eos> some answers in life are so easy <eos> like zero plus zero is none <eos> but how do we divide the smell of flowers <eos> so their fragance is shared by everyone <eos> if i could divide the smell of flowers <eos> then youd always have your share <eos> if i could divide the smell of flowers <eos> thered be sweetness around you <eos> everywhere where are my buds from yesterday <eos> men who raised me up when i was down <eos> mates who kept their faith in me <eos> guys who always handed me the crown <eos> where are my old confidants <eos> men who taught me all about life <eos> warriors who beat the drums <eos> when we would fight the fight <eos> my lover can bathe me in her naked tender core <eos> provide a warm place in which to hide <eos> but when its time for war <eos> time for blood <eos> i need my soldiers by my side <eos> my lover can soothe me in her deep warm soul <eos> perfume away all my misery <eos> but when its time to roll <eos> time for guns <eos> i need my soldiers backing me <eos> victories dont feel so good <eos> losses seem more intense <eos> early mornings feel the worst <eos> when i really miss my old friends <eos> where are my old confidants <eos> men who taught me all about life

snowballs launched our way <eos> by the enemies of our kind <eos> in a graveyards mourning light <eos> we both choked up cried and cried <eos> as the angels lifted him <eos> on deaths gloomy wings of flight <eos> and you declared me dead my brother <eos> for the crime of being me <eos> for all the faults i have <eos> well i still cannot believe <eos> that you declared me dead my brother <eos> for the crime of being me <eos> for all the faults i have <eos> well i still cannot believe <eos> and my only wish for you my brother <eos> is someday youll understand <eos> how it feels to be a corpse <eos> walking amongst your fellow man <eos> in the haze of our carefree youth <eos> we both wildly joked and joked <eos> about wicked ironies <eos> of the enemies of truth <eos> beside a pool so crystal blue <eos> really both had hoped <eos> that good luck would fill our lives <eos> in everything we would pursue <eos> but you declared me dead my brother <eos> for the crime of being me <eos> for all the faults i have <eos> well i still cannot believe <eos> that you declared me dead my brother <eos> for the crime of being me <eos> for all the faults i have <eos> well i still cannot believe <eos> and my only wish for you my brother <eos> is someday you ll understand <eos> how it feels to be a corpse <eos> walking amongst your fellow man <eos> and yet the pain has made me strong <eos> i forgive you youre my brother how do i thank <eos> the voice in the night <eos> call of hope <eos> after the world turned dark <eos> how do i thank <eos> the voice in the night <eos> healing words

there was a boy <eos> playing on a swing <eos> deep in love with life <eos> loving everything <eos> and hed speak to god <eos> when all alone <eos> making deals with god <eos> bout his dreams and hopes <eos> when the night would fall <eos> and hed lie in bed <eos> listening to the tunes <eos> playing in his head <eos> and the boy made a wish <eos> prayed to god up high <eos> "let me write a song <eos> makes the whole world cry <eos> let me write a song <eos> so tender sad and sweet <eos> the kind of song <eos> drops men to their knees" <eos> nowhere near a man <eos> he didnt understand <eos> that to write a song <eos> makes the whole world cry <eos> have to hold the hand <eos> of a friend who dies <eos> hear your brother curse your name <eos> watch your mother fade away <eos> while crooks steal your gold <eos> suffer years being alone <eos> nowhere near a man <eos> he didnt understand <eos> that to write a song <eos> makes the whole world cry <eos> have to fall in love <eos> then be denied <eos> meet hopeless kids <eos> raised in cruel neglect <eos> hear animals scream <eos> tortured half to death <eos> there was a boy <eos> prayed to god up high <eos> "let me write a song <eos> makes the whole world cry <eos> let me write a song <eos> tender sad and sweet <eos> the kind of song <eos> drops men to their knees" <eos> if i could reach that boy <eos> before it gets too late <eos> warn him there are wishes <eos> you should never make <eos> but that boy was me <eos> and its far too late <eos> wrote this song in tears <eos> wrote this song in pain <eos> and now im a man <eos> and now i understand <eos> so torn up inside <eos> just want to cry <eos> i want to crycrycry <eos> oh god i want to cry <eos> i want to cry met a young man on the road <eos> who looked me in the eye so cold <eos> told me i was way too old <eos> to write songs <eos> in the usa <eos> met a young man full of hate <eos> who called me grandpa to my face <eos> said i never could relate <eos> to young kids <eos> in the usa <eos> and he asked <eos> why did you wait so long <eos> to sit down and write a song <eos> and he said <eos> grandpa you waited too long <eos> its too late to write your songs <eos> twenty years ago <eos> never had the heart <eos> never had the sight <eos> twenty years ago <eos> never had the smarts <eos> never saw the light <eos> twenty years ago <eos> never felt the pain <eos> never felt the awe <eos> twenty years ago <eos> never felt my shame <eos> never knew my flaws <eos> theres nothing i can write today <eos> i could have written way back then <eos> nothing i

smiles <eos> mama <eos> i know i wasnt there <eos> for you <eos> would have placed <eos> a magic carpet <eos> neath your weak and shaky legs <eos> would have raised <eos> a strong west wind <eos> let

night <eos> we spoke of god <eos> in a cloud of high blue smoke <eos> at the first midnight stroke <eos> one night <eos> we spoke of god <eos> atop a steep quiet hill <eos> we pondered our free will <eos> one night <eos> we spoke of god <eos> under tarry blackened sky <eos> we wondered why <eos> why oh why oh why <eos> there are people in our lives <eos> who cause us pain <eos> from whom we cannot flee <eos> there are people in this world <eos> who would bring us sweet love <eos> we can never hope to meet <eos> one night <eos> we spoke of god <eos> asking questions very strange <eos> is it all prearranged <eos> one night <eos> we spoke of god <eos> under tarry blackened sky <eos> we wondered why <eos> why oh why oh why <eos> we spoke of god <eos> got high on god <eos> cried about god <eos> tried to find god <eos> we spoke of god <eos> got whacked on god <eos> mad about god <eos> sad about god <eos> we spoke of god <eos> got crazed on god <eos> estranged from god <eos> afraid of god <eos> god now you can live forever <eos> a oneeyed cat <eos> walks along a wall <eos> now you can live forever <eos> looks ahead <eos> and sees it all <eos> now you can live forever <eos> bless the moon <eos> that guides my way <eos> now you can live forever <eos> and leads green lizards <eos> to their grave <eos> now you can live forever <eos> in air so hot <eos> i can hardly breathe <eos> now you can live forever <eos> escaped my past <eos> and found my peace <eos> now you can live forever <eos> in dark deep caves <eos> where snakes grow big <eos> now you can live forever <eos> thats

a young boy <eos> in this world everythings as good as bad <eos> now my father told me always speak a true word <eos> and i have to say that is the best advice ive had <eos> because something burns inside of me <eos> its everything i long to be <eos> and lies they only stop me from feeling free <eos> like a hobo from a broken home <eos> nothings gonna stop me <eos> like a hobo from a broken home <eos> nothings gonna stop me <eos> oh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> ive never yearned for anybodys fortune <eos> the less i have the more i am a happy man <eos> now my mother told me always keep your head on <eos> because some may praise you just to get what they want <eos> and i said mama i am not afraid <eos> they will take what they will take <eos> and what would life be like without a few mistakes <eos> like a hobo from a broken home <eos> nothings gonna stop me <eos> like a hobo from a broken home <eos> nothings gonna stop me <eos> oh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> oh ah ah ah ah ah ah

of doing well <eos> for herself <eos> she never spoke of feeling sad <eos> was oh so close with the family and friends <eos> she had around her <eos> but she went quietly <eos> she didnt make a sound <eos> she went quietly <eos> with the wish not to be found <eos> she went quietly <eos> without a word of where <eos> just a note that wrote <eos> "forgetting is easier" <eos> years have fallen since the day <eos> she wrote the note and chose to float away <eos> into the ether <eos> someone said they saw her south <eos> at the coast on the rivers mouth <eos> but only briefly <eos> cause she went quietly <eos> she didnt make a sound <eos> she went quietly <eos> with the wish not to be found <eos> she went quietly <eos> without a word of where <eos> just a note that wrote <eos> "forgetting is easier" <eos> she went quietly <eos> she didnt make a sound <eos> she went quietly <eos> with the wish not to be found <eos> she went quietly <eos> without a word of where <eos> just a note that wrote <eos> "forgetting is easier" <eos> out of the blue in the pouring rain <eos> to my doorstep old and cold today she came <eos> with her story <eos> i asked her in but she declined <eos> had just one single thing to get off her mind <eos> and that was "sorry" i heard you calling me <eos> as i was swept away deeper into the sea <eos> in love i missed its treachery swimming free <eos> an in one breath a twist of fate made history <eos> mother nature took me in <eos> she swept me under then i knew this was my end <eos> my whole life flashed in front of me so suddenly <eos> and sinking down i knew i still could hear your scream <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> theres nothing i can do <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> to answer back to you <eos> an now youre loosing sleep <eos> with memories you spend all night playing hide and seek <eos> replaying how it should have been and could have been <eos> if only there were omens that you could have seen <eos> back in that room again <eos> you hope to reach me through a medium <eos> but there is no use i cant reply to this lovers cry <eos> oh how i wish i just could see you <eos> one more time to say goodbye <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> theres nothing i can do <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> to answer back to you <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> theres nothing i can do <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> to answer back to you <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> theres nothing i can do <eos> i hear you calling me <eos> to answer back to you hello alone its you and me again <eos> how can we pretend weve never met <eos> hello alone you might as well come in <eos> weve been making bets for so long now <eos> i never told you that i want you <eos> i thought i had you out of my head <eos> but ever time she leaves me refusing to believe me <eos> youre always there <eos> and even though i dont invite you <eos> and your presence is a pain <eos> you always let me be just who i am <eos> until im glad to bring back that refrain again <eos> hello alone its you and me again <eos> how can we pretend weve never met <eos> hello alone you might as well come in <eos> weve been shaking hands for too long now <eos> i even tried to reconvince you <eos> but it was just no use at all <eos> cause every time i climbed inside your mind <eos> i saw the mirror on the wall <eos> but its no use to pose the question <eos> when the answers never sheen <eos> and then i have to face up to the facts <eos> with saxophones and old trombones carrying me home to say <eos> hello alone its you and me again <eos> how can we pretend weve never met <eos> hello alone you might as well come in <eos> weve been making bets for too long <eos> perhaps ill take a holiday <eos> and get as far away as i can <eos> but then id just be far away <eos> and just as a much a lonesome man <eos> with his hat in his hands chanting <eos> hello alone its you and me again <eos> how can we pretend weve never met <eos> hello alone you might as well come in <eos> weve been making bets for too long now mother <eos> ive gotta get out of here <eos> so i can save our family <eos> from this poverty <eos> and when i make my money <eos> ill send it back to you <eos> father <eos> give me strength i pray <eos> i have to end this misery <eos> its causing too much pain <eos> im gonna look for richer lands <eos> where the moneys made <eos> im gonna put my whole world <eos> in your hands <eos> i have to put my whole world <eos> in your hands <eos> in your hands <eos> mister <eos> please let me work somehow <eos> youve kept me waiting months <eos> and still im not allowed <eos> and every time you promise me <eos> "not much longer now" <eos> ive had to put my whole world <eos> in your hands <eos> im gonna put my whole world <eos> in your hands <eos> in your hands <eos> hey hey oho <eos> listen listen to me <eos> mister mister you say youre trying <eos> but dont you know my brothers dying <eos> you say "it wont be long" <eos> but why

my enemies are plotting against me <eos> eager to take my life <eos> they devise their schemes and mark my steps <eos> all day long <eos> they twist my words to bring me hurt <eos> all day long <eos> for you have delivered me from death <eos> and set my feet on solid ground <eos> so that i could walk before youin your light this ones bout a man <eos> who thought that he had figured it out <eos> figured it out <eos> when i found him <eos> he told me that he didnt need any help <eos> from anyone else <eos> if ive got this on my own <eos> if ive got this on my own <eos> then the only hope im holding onto now is me <eos> we live for life we always climb <eos> we always want to go further <eos> are you really entitled to anything <eos> are you really are you really <eos> i was bigger when i made myself smaller <eos> i was bigger when i made myself small <eos> as the years went by <eos> i started asking him what do you deserve <eos> what do you deserve <eos> if your life revolves around yourself <eos> then what are you worth <eos> what are you worth been hanging around <eos> this old house <eos> its a mess <eos> it aint sound or even safe <eos> been driving around <eos> the neighborhood <eos> seen lots of others <eos> looking a lot like mine <eos> i need you to come in <eos> and clean me <eos> ive had my doubts about it <eos> free me <eos> and clean out <eos> this old house of mine <eos> you can sleep in <eos> the living room <eos> but keep away room <eos> the closet in the back <eos> cause ive got skeletons <eos> i dont want you to see <eos> and ive got secrets <eos> i dont want you to know <eos> been wondering why you <eos> would want to stay here <eos> would want to come in <eos> amongst all of my grime <eos> been thinking about how <eos> you dont even care <eos> about the shame i wear <eos> you love me all the same what was that about loving my friends and loving my enemies too <eos> what was that about giving to the poor and judging others kindly <eos> what was that about forgiving the guy whos only ever hurt me <eos> something you said got buried deep in my shallow heart <eos> i never quite got it through my head <eos> that what i do has to back up what i say <eos> my faith is in the grave <eos> its not what you believe that counts <eos> but only what you believe enough to do <eos> my mouth is an empty gun <eos> let us speak with truth and action <eos> would you lay down your life for your brother <eos> would you sell what you own and give it all away <eos> do you try to live out what you learn <eos> or do you just pick and choose what you want to ignore pull this material skeleton off my skin <eos> expose my heart make me raw <eos> open me up let the therapy begin <eos> help me heal make me real <eos> i dont want to go home

got the opportunity to act <eos> everyone deserves <eos> to be treated well by you <eos> everyone deserves your love <eos> hello my sister <eos> you are the face of a nameless race <eos> of lust and lies and alcohol and drugs <eos> but whatve i got that makes me better <eos> ive still got my vices <eos> what is it that makes me think <eos> im worth more than another <eos> everyone deserves your

worn out where the years took their toll <eos> trying to turn these shattered shards into something whole <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> turning it into a song <eos> most of the greatest lessons i have learned <eos> fell out of the failures that left me feeling burned <eos> this road is hard and this world sure aint kind <eos> but my broken parts are a sign that im alive <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> turning it into a song <eos> im playing with a wild fire <eos> creating control <eos> im playing with a wild fire <eos> its all i know <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> trying to find meaning in the coughs and the rattles <eos> im banging on a tight wire <eos> turning it into a song i know i said i wouldnt complain <eos> when the weight became too much to bear <eos> but that was before i felt all the strain <eos> of the work involved in getting where <eos> i want to be <eos> steady me <eos> help me plant my feet <eos> while i grit my teeth <eos> help me find my voice <eos> its lost in all this noise <eos> come and set me free <eos> help me find my peace <eos> while i work my hands to the bone <eos> i know i said i wouldnt complain <eos> when the going started getting rough <eos> but now that i sit here gripping the reins <eos> i begin to feel ive had enough <eos> of all this up and down <eos> steady me <eos> help me plant my feet <eos> while i grit my teeth <eos> help me find my voice <eos> its lost in all this noise <eos> come and set me free <eos> help me find my peace <eos> while i work my hands to the bone <eos> please dont leave me <eos> down and out and crawling back for more <eos> i need a hand <eos> i found out i cant do this on my own <eos> trying to has left me here alone <eos> has left me on my own <eos> steady me <eos> help me plant my feet <eos> while i grit my teeth <eos> help me find my voice <eos> its lost in all this noise <eos> come and set me free <eos> help me find my peace <eos> while i work my hands to the bone wake up rattled from another sleepless night <eos> stuck in between miracles and traffic lights <eos> work like the devil but youre never satisfied <eos> you set your pace likes its required <eos> and feel completely uninspired <eos> dont let your well run dry <eos> keep it filled up <eos> here it comes again another week gone by <eos> like a train almost out of sight <eos> you try to catch it but you always fall behind <eos> you feel your race has run its course <eos> but you still live in remorse <eos> dont let your well run dry <eos> keep it filled up <eos> i can see that youre running on empty <eos> i can see that your heart is tired <eos> theres no use in flying solo <eos> caught in a stampede of lies <eos> pounded in the ground like railroad ties <eos> trying so hard that your engines fried <eos> lay down and rest tonight <eos> dont let your well run dry <eos> keep it filled up one day ill come riding over them hills <eos> with the salt in my hair and the sand upon my soles <eos> with the rivers current rushing through my veins <eos> and the life i found when i grabbed hold of the reins <eos> i promise ill come back around <eos> i just gotta leave for a little while <eos> one day youll see me walking through these streets <eos> one day ill arrive and finally find some sleep <eos> with a wizened frame and a clean slate of mind <eos> and the kind of love that only comes with time <eos> i promise ill come back around <eos> i just gotta leave for a little while you count the coins and years of work <eos> that put them in your pocket <eos> could you exist on any less <eos> if suddenly you lost it <eos> do you depend on your own hands <eos> put your title down <eos> everything you have is a gift <eos> put your title down <eos> be thankful <eos> is sustenance the effect of work <eos> or is that an illusion <eos> the earths carefree simplicity <eos> has led to my conclusion <eos> i depend on my own hands <eos> put your title down <eos> everything you have is a gift <eos> put your title down <eos> be thankful <eos> the nurturing of birds and trees <eos> is not of their own will <eos> the source providing all they need <eos> is nurturing me still <eos> put your title down <eos> everything you have is a gift <eos> put your title down <eos> be thankful on the sand i arise <eos> here i stand with the tides <eos> will this shore be my fate <eos> is there more than this state <eos> will you come and rescue me <eos> will you even answer me <eos> hanging on by a thread <eos> am i left here for dead <eos> no im certain out there <eos> out beyond the breakers <eos> theres a land green and fair <eos> and one day i will see her <eos> will you come and rescue me <eos> will you even answer me <eos> calling on a world unseen <eos> putting messages in bottles <eos> and trusting the sea <eos> will you come and rescue me <eos> will you even answer me my heart is a winding river <eos> runs wherever it wants to <eos> down out of the towering hills <eos> rushing toward the sea <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> connecting the dots <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> laid out and plotted <eos> my heart is a winding river <eos> guided by a strong pull <eos> allgoing and neverknowing <eos> gravity is a thief <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> connecting the dots <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> laid out and plotted <eos> evaporate then spit me out <eos> over the falls then back to the clouds <eos> endlessly racing onward <eos> evermore forever <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> connecting the dots <eos> i am a watercourse <eos> laid out and plotted i am the cost and i am

warm sweet nights <eos> and where is the candlelight <eos> bright as the life and times that we once knew <eos> and when is it healing time <eos> and when does the peace of mind <eos> fill in the hole in my life where once was you <eos> and where are all the bonds that we shared <eos> and when did you begin not to care <eos> chorus <eos> never mind the where never mind the when <eos> i could never love that way again <eos> it doesnt matter where the fault may lie <eos> i dont want to know the reason why <eos> my heart told me one day <eos> you and i were fine <eos> woke up one morning <eos> and fate said never mind <eos> verse <eos> look at the state im in <eos> how can the world still spin <eos> im trying to breathe again but i cant seem to <eos> they talk about laying low <eos> they talk about letting go <eos> theyre talking cause they dont know i been run right through <eos> and where are all the bonds that we shared <eos> and when did you begin not to care <eos> chorus <eos> never

as we know it <eos> and who is the teacher and who is the child <eos> when there are no road signs that point our direction <eos> sometimes it seems like the whole world is running wild <eos> oh how i wish you were with us tonight <eos> wed raise up our glasses and bid you a fond goodbye <eos> oh if i could just see your face at my door <eos> one more one more time <eos> we live in a world of free will and volition <eos> were turning our eyes to some power above <eos> we murmur the words of an act of contrition <eos> knowing so many weve lost and weve loved <eos> and oh how i wish they were with us tonight <eos> wed raise up our glasses and bid them a fond goodbye <eos> oh if i could just see your face at my door <eos> one more one more time <eos> oh and everything we ever thought might be endless or bound less <eos> lie scattered around us in ruins <eos> we wonder why <eos> buried there among the pages <eos> the prophets and sages have bound to the ages <eos> the book of our lives <eos> oh how i wish you were with us tonight <eos> oh if i could just see your face at my door <eos> one more one more time <eos> one more one more time <eos> one more one more time build me a bridge so i can climb to the top <eos> and take a big breath of air <eos> no one can tell me what is wrong <eos> cause i am the only one here <eos> life kept on running faster than me <eos> i could not stop her so she kindly stopped for me <eos> show me a mountain <eos> i am ready to see it sitting right in my hands <eos> my love is an ocean <eos> but i cant even swallow one grain of sand <eos> oh often i couldnt stand the stench of my own self <eos> but still i never wanted to be anybody else <eos> people are searching through their black abyss <eos> looking for all the things that they could have missed <eos> but ive never found a quick way to cure <eos> give me some time and as it goes by <eos> ill try to figure out what makes sense <eos> it seems to me that everything should come together in the end <eos> my conscience once asked me to always be kind <eos> i let her down but shes still here by my side <eos> light me a fire my hands are shaking <eos> they look like the moon <eos> a sweater is nice but a friendship is better <eos> cause itll keep you through til june <eos> oh when we were kids there was so much to climb <eos> and we screwed up so many times but at least we tried i saw the way you light a room <eos> the night i met you <eos> in that light i just knew <eos> wed be together <eos> something old something new <eos> i borrowed all thats true <eos> and gave away the blue <eos> years gone longing for a kiss <eos> and a touch of fire <eos> ended sweetly with a wish <eos> and an angel choir <eos> love had never felt like this <eos> all roads open wide <eos> to bring me home at night <eos> i want to live a long time with you <eos> let me have a long time with you <eos> i want to take a long time with you <eos> lets say we do <eos> i know well have our trouble times

away from red heaven <eos> this is my postcard from texas <eos> what are the chances this town wont wreck us <eos> there is a woman there always is <eos> shes standin on the side of the stage <eos> beckoning motionless <eos> and my legs get weak <eos> and my heart beats fast <eos> and i thought the love we had <eos> was built to last <eos> and my thoughts take off <eos> where my hands want to go <eos> and i know and i know and i know <eos> baby believe me <eos> baby believe me <eos> i didnt do nothin <eos> theres a strange black bird here <eos> which is mostly tall <eos> makes a sound like an ambulance <eos> thats her mating call <eos> she sings a warning in the cold night air <eos> shes out in the distance <eos> she should be sleeping <eos> but i can still hear her <eos> im steppin out of a dream into a steamy car <eos> and we huddle for safety at the cannibal bar <eos> how far can i run away from this ring on my finger <eos> is there a place where we can go to <eos> shed our fear like clothes <eos> and make love new <eos> i always thought that you would <eos> be the one to come running to me <eos> when i call your name <eos> it gives me pain to think <eos> i drink the wine of time alone <eos> i toast to us <eos> thats not enough thats what you said <eos> love isnt dead its only hiding <eos> and i know we can find it inside <eos> if we just let our hearts collide <eos> so slow the road goes all around the moon and back <eos> to light up the skin on your face <eos> its not my place but im standing here <eos> its clear the water rushes to the shore <eos> and then recedes like love when it bleeds <eos> the deeper the needs <eos> mimi i found the thunder and so i <eos> understand <eos> me me no need to wonder <eos> i made it easy to take my hand <eos> and ive got no secret agenda no hidden plan <eos> just give me one more chance <eos> to get next to you <eos> make it up to you <eos> give me one more chance <eos> to love you soulfully <eos> like you live for me <eos>

thats just a lie by society <eos> so i start looking at the world we have <eos> and while its not all bad <eos> theres a lot of room for improvement <eos> people of color and the gay movement <eos> whos so scared <eos> wont you explain to me that pain of your life everyday i find i am looking for me <eos> and these unfinished lives <eos> and every movement and motion unsettles my heart <eos> its

<eos> blow eighty dollars on these high heel shoes <eos> looks like a pump feels like a sneaker <eos> do they think were idiots but i bought em <eos> now im standing in a subway car <eos> i ride because i cannot walk far <eos> i couldnt find an empty cab on the street <eos> they were filled with highheeled women with nonfunctioning feet <eos> twentysix years ago i dreamed of wearing shoes like these <eos> oh the warped mind of the preteen with her strange priorities <eos> but this is a nightmare <eos> of unsteady ankles hands waving in the air <eos> but the looks my legs <eos> are getting from that man across the aisle <eos> almost make the pain and misery <eos> and doctor bills worthwhile <eos> if by chance you happen to meet <eos> this wobbly woman walking down your street <eos> the click of high heels on concrete <eos> is not the thrill of victory its the agony of defeat <eos> oh look at me everybody i learned this from paula abdul <eos> oh take pity on my vanity maybe question my sanity <eos> why i wear these uncomfortable things heaven knows <eos> which make me wonder about these pierced earrings <eos> and my pantyhose my control top <eos> ooh i can see you dont want me to sing about pantyhose <eos> youd rather i go back to tap dancing <eos> like my close personal friend paula abdul <eos> who like me was a geek back in high school <eos> oh im sorry but thats not what this song is about <eos> at least it wasnt when it started out <eos> i pray this subway ride never ends <eos> so i will never never have to walk again <eos> in high heels its a different atmosphere <eos> in high heels i can see your house from here <eos> in high heels high heels if youll step inside this great glass elevator <eos> itll take us up above the city lights <eos> to where the planet curves away to the equator <eos> i want to show you something fine <eos> you can see the roads that we all traveled just to get here <eos> a million minuscule decisions in a line <eos> why they brought us to this moment isnt clear <eos> but thats all right weve got all night <eos> could it be that the many roads <eos> you took to get here <eos> were just for me to tell this story <eos> and for you to hear this song <eos> and your many hopes <eos> and your many fears <eos> were meant to bring you here all along <eos> so if youll trust me with your time ill spend it wisely <eos> i will sing to you with all i have to give <eos> if you traveled all this way then i will do my best to play <eos> my biggest hits that dont exist <eos> and if youll lend to me your ear ill sing em pretty <eos> i will never ever sing em out of tune <eos> and i will not forget the words <eos> of any chorus bridge or verse <eos> i promise you <eos> chorus <eos> weve got benjamin to play that old piano <eos> if were lucky its a little out of tune <eos> weve got andy on the guitar cause i promised him <eos> some texas barbecue <eos> how i love to watch you listen to the music <eos> cause you sing to me a music of your own <eos> as i cast out all these lines so afraid that i will find <eos> i am alone all alone <eos> could it be that the many roads <eos> i took to get here <eos> were just for you to tell that story <eos> and for me to hear that song <eos> and my many hopes <eos> and my many fears <eos> were meant to bring me here all along <eos> we were meant to be right here all along i grew up in a little town <eos> a southern mix of lost and found <eos> where most folks seem to stick around <eos> but i could hear the highway song <eos> id sit out on the dock till dawn <eos> and dream about the great beyond <eos> i dreamed that i was <eos> a world traveler <eos> set me loose to find my way <eos> just get me out on the road someday <eos> with my sails unfurled <eos> so many mysteries <eos> i wanted to unravel <eos> if i could travel the world <eos> soon enough i had my way <eos> i saw the world the lord has made <eos> mostly from the interstate <eos> but i had hardly seen a thing <eos> until i gave a golden ring <eos> to the one who gave her heart to me <eos> and i became <eos> a world traveler <eos> thats the day i hit the road <eos> cause i walked the hills of the human soul <eos> of a tender girl <eos> im a world traveler <eos> she opened the gate and took my hand <eos> and led me into the mystic land <eos> where her galaxies swirl <eos> so many mysteries <eos> i never will unravel <eos> i want to travel the world <eos> take a left at the end of my street <eos> just a few doors down <eos> up the hill and into the trees <eos> theres a hole in the ground <eos> where we traveled the caverns so deep <eos> we wandered the wonders so wide <eos> it was right beneath our feet <eos> all this time all this time <eos> tonight i saw the children in their rooms <eos> little flowers all in bloom <eos> burning suns and silver moon <eos> and somehow in that starry sky <eos> the image of the maker lies <eos> right here beneath my roof tonight <eos> so hold on tight im a <eos> world traveler <eos> pack yours bags and dig down deep <eos> lets ride the storms and sail the seas <eos> to the distant pole <eos> im a world traveler <eos> into these uncharted lands <eos> to blaze a trail in the vast expanse <eos> of the heart and soul <eos> in the grace of the god of peace <eos> lets wade into the battle <eos> come on come on with me <eos> and get up in that saddle <eos> theres a million mysteries <eos> i never will unravel <eos> come on lets travel the world i was nineteen you were twentyone <eos> the year we got engaged <eos> everyone said we were much too young <eos> but we did it anyway <eos> we bought our rings for forty each <eos> from a pawn shop down the road <eos> we said our vows and took the leap <eos> now fifteen years ago <eos> we went dancing in the minefields <eos> we went sailing in the storm <eos> and it was harder than we dreamed <eos> but i believe thats what the promise is for <eos> "i do" are the two most famous last words <eos> the beginning of the end <eos> but to lose your life for another ive heard <eos> is a good place to begin <eos> cause the only way to find your life <eos> is to lay your own life down <eos> and i believe its an easy price <eos> for the life that we have found <eos> and were dancing in the minefields <eos> were sailing in the storm <eos> this is harder than we dreamed <eos> but i believe thats what the promise is for <eos> so when i lose my way find me <eos> when i loose loves chains bind me <eos> at the end of all my faith till the end of all my days <eos> when i forget my name remind me <eos> cause we bear the light of the son of man <eos> so theres nothing left to fear <eos> so ill walk with you in the shadowlands <eos> till the shadows disappear <eos> cause he promised not to leave us <eos> and his promises are true <eos> so in the face of all this chaos baby <eos> i can dance with you i can see the storm descending on the hill tonight <eos> tall trees are bending to your will tonight <eos> let the mighty bow down <eos> at the thundering sound of your voice <eos> i can hear the howling wind and feel the rain tonight <eos> every drop a prophet in your name tonight <eos> and the words that they sing <eos> they are washing me clean but <eos> how long until this curtain is lifted <eos> how long is this the song that we sing <eos> how long until the reckoning <eos> and i know you hear the cries of every soul tonight <eos> you see the teardrops as they roll tonight <eos> down the faces of saints <eos> who grow weary and faint in your fields <eos> and the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight <eos> but when the god of love and thunder speaks tonight <eos> down the faces of saints <eos> who grow weary and faint in your fields <eos> and the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight <eos> but when the god of love and thunder speaks tonight <eos> i believe you will come <eos> your justice be done but how long <eos> you are holiness and grace <eos> you are fury and rest <eos> you are anger and love <eos> you curse and you bless <eos> you are mighty and weak <eos> you are silence and song <eos> you are plain as the day <eos> but you have hidden your face <eos> for how long how long <eos> and i am standing in the stillness of the reckoning <eos> the storm is past and rest is beckoning <eos> mighty god how i fear you <eos> how i long to be near you o lord <eos> how long until the burden is lifted <eos> how long is this the song that we sing <eos> how long until the reckoning <eos> and i know that i dont know what im asking <eos> but i long to look you full in the face <eos> i am ready for the reckoning we chose the spot we dug the hole <eos> we laid the maples in the ground to have and hold <eos> as autumn falls to winters sleep <eos> we pray that somehow in the spring <eos> the roots grow deep <eos> and many years from now <eos> long after we are gone <eos> these trees will spread their branches out <eos> and bless the dawn <eos> he took a plane to africa <eos> he gathered up into his arms <eos> an orphan son <eos> so many years from now <eos> long after we are gone <eos> this tree will spread its branches out <eos> and bless the dawn <eos> so sit down and write that letter <eos> sign up and join the fight <eos> sink in to all that matters <eos> step out into the light <eos> let go of all thats passing <eos> lift up the least of these <eos> lean into something lasting <eos> planting trees <eos> she rises up as morning breaks <eos> she moves among these rooms alone <eos> before we wake <eos> and her heart is so full it overflows <eos> she waters us with love and the children grow <eos> so many years from now <eos> long after we are gone <eos> these trees will spread their branches out <eos> and bless the dawn <eos> these trees will spread their branches out <eos> and bless someone i am weary with the pain of jacobs wrestling <eos> in the darkness with the fear in the darkness with the fear <eos> but he met the morning wounded with a blessing <eos> so in the night my hope lives on <eos> when elisha woke surrounded by the forces <eos> of the enemies of god the enemies of god <eos> he saw the hills aflame with angels on their horses <eos> so in the night my hope lives on <eos> i see the slave that toils beneath the yoke unyielding <eos> and i can hear the captive groan hear the captive groan <eos> for some hand to stay the whip his foe is wielding <eos> still in the night my hope lives on <eos> i see the armies of the enemy approaching <eos> and the people driven trembling to the shore <eos> but a doorway through the waters now is opening <eos> so in the night my hope lives on <eos> like the son who thought hed gone beyond forgiveness <eos> too ashamed to lift his headbut if he could lift his head <eos> he would see his father running from a distance <eos> in the night my hope lives on <eos> i can see the crowd of men retreating <eos> as he stands between the woman and their stones <eos> and if mercy in his holy heart is beating <eos> then in the night my hope lives on <eos> i remember how they scorned the son of mary <eos> he was gentle as a lamb gentle as a lamb <eos> he was beaten he was crucified and buried <eos> and in the night my hope was gone <eos> but the rulers of earth could not control him <eos> they did not take his lifehe laid it down <eos> all the chains of death could never hope to hold him <eos> so in the night my hope lives on god of my fathers <eos> huddled in the harbor <eos> every man an ocean from his home <eos> their captors could not keep them <eos> when they heard the drums of freedom <eos> the dream of a kingdom <eos> in a land theyve never known <eos> and god of my fathers <eos> strangers in this country <eos> pilgrims on these dusty roads <eos> across the great plains <eos> in the bellies of the steel trains <eos> to stake a new claim <eos> in that wilderness of hope <eos> like my fathers i am looking for a home <eos> looking for a home beyond the sea <eos> so be my god and guide me <eos> till i lie beneath the hills <eos> then let the great god of my fathers <eos> be the great god of my children still <eos> god of my grandfathers <eos> gone these many years now <eos> i guess theyre shining like the sun <eos> and i envision them <eos> grinning at the finish <eos> and they smile and they smile <eos> cause they love to see me run <eos> chorus <eos> now were counting stars and counting sand <eos> little feet and little hands <eos> were counting joys <eos> we pray youll know them <eos> as you knew us when you wove us <eos> as you hold us <eos> hold them please hold them <eos> like their father they are looking for a home <eos> looking for a home beyond the sea <eos> so be their god and guide them <eos> till they lie beneath these hills <eos> and let the great god of their father <eos> be the great god of their children <eos> let the great god of my fathers <eos> be the great god of my children still why dont the mountains make me cry no more <eos> they dont sing the way they did before <eos> theyre just piles of stone <eos> as dead as bones <eos> like corpses on a field of war <eos> and they just dont make me cry no more <eos> and the highways like an old sad song <eos> people moving through their lives alone <eos> on the run from grace <eos> from place to place <eos> like fugitives without a home <eos> and the highways like an old sad song <eos> and my heart is black as coal <eos> its been mined and there aint no gold <eos> its so dark in there <eos> but i dont care <eos> i will lay down in the this empty hole <eos> where my heart is black as coal <eos> and oh there is nowhere left to go from here <eos> i have fallen past the last frontier <eos> but at the bottom of this well i hear you breathing <eos> love below me <eos> love around me <eos> love above me <eos> love has found me <eos> love has found me here <eos> so lay me down <eos> oh lay me down in a field of golden <eos> lay me down <eos> oh lay me down in a field of golden <eos> lay me down <eos> love above love below me <eos> oh lay me down in a field of gold and green somewhere along the scottish coast <eos> and emerald island lies <eos> and i will steer my sailing boat <eos> unto the isle of skye <eos> the weathers always changing <eos> from heavy cloud to fair <eos> and even when its raining <eos> its always lovely there one two three two <eos> its so easy to cash in these chips on my shoulder <eos> so easy to lose this whole tongue like a tiger <eos> its easy to let all this bitterness smolder <eos> just to hide it away like a cigarette lighter <eos> its easy to curse and to hurt and to hinder <eos> its easy to not have the heart to remember <eos> that i am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of god <eos> ive got voices that scream in my head like a siren <eos> fears that i feel in the night when i sleep <eos> stupid choices i made when i laid in the mire <eos> like a kid in the mud on some dirty blind street <eos> ive got sorrow to spare ive got loneliness too <eos> ive got blood on these hands that hold on to the truth <eos> that i am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of god <eos> well i swore on the bible to not tell a lie but ive lied and lied <eos> and ive crossed my heart and i hoped to die and ive died and died <eos> but if its true that you gathered my sin in your hand and you cast it as far as the east from the west <eos> if its true that you put on the flesh of a man and you walked in my shoes through the shadow of death <eos> if its true that you dwell in the halls of my heart then im not just a fool with a fancy guitar <eos> no i am a priest and a prince in the kingdom i am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of god you could no more kill the darkness <eos> than you could raise the sun <eos> and the sky was cold and black <eos> like the barrel of a gun <eos> and i remember the tremble <eos> in the words you spoke <eos> as you balanced there on the brink <eos> at the end of your rope <eos> you came so close to letting go <eos> and you knew she would hate you <eos> she would kick you out <eos> youd been lying in the bed that you made <eos> when you broke your vow <eos> then you woke in the wasteland <eos> of the truth you told <eos> and you turned to see she stayed <eos> she was bright as a band of gold <eos> you came so close to letting go <eos> so dont let go cause you never know <eos> dont let go you never know for sure <eos> and the sky in nashville <eos> it can bend you low <eos> cause the winter here is gray <eos> without a trace of snow <eos> but there is no shadow <eos> on the silver stars <eos> and the colder the night is <eos> the closer the heavens are <eos> and were so close <eos> so dont let go <eos> cause this i know <eos> dont let go <eos> this i know for sure <eos> theres still hope come climb the hill with me <eos> come and be still with me <eos> come watch the sun sink away <eos> if you will with me <eos> come watch the garden grow <eos> down by the gravel road <eos> come warm your hands in the gold <eos> of the afterglow <eos> into the peace of these wild things <eos> into the wild of this grace <eos> into the grace of this blessing <eos> speak in the peace of this place <eos> come walk the cedar stand <eos> over the broken dam <eos> sit on the bench at the bend in the trail again <eos> look how the children laugh <eos> out in the tumble grass <eos> bright as a fire and as fine as a photograph <eos> chorus <eos> here at the magic hour <eos> time and eternity <eos> mingle a moment in chorus <eos> here at the magic hour <eos> bright is the mystery <eos> plain is the beauty before us <eos> could this beauty be for us <eos> what is this voice that sings <eos> holy and hovering <eos> over this hill in the still of the evening <eos> son of god speak i remember once i broke down in the country <eos> i was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom <eos> and i walked home through the pines <eos> nobody saw me but the moon <eos> by sunrise i could hear the church bells ringing <eos> i got there as the saints were marching in <eos> i sat down on the back row <eos> and heard the story once again <eos> and the servants of the secret fire <eos> were gathered there <eos> the embers of the ages <eos> like a living prayer <eos> and all at once i saw the shadows flee <eos> shine your light on me on me <eos> be a light unto my path <eos> and a lamp unto my feet <eos> they flew us down to oklahoma city <eos> yeah but i could hardly stand there on the stage <eos> so sick i couldnt speak <eos> and the fever wouldnt break <eos> but when i stepped up to the microphone i heard it <eos> it was the voices of the brothers at my side <eos> they were singing out my song <eos> when the song in me had died <eos> oh shine your light on me <eos> somebody come and get me when im gone <eos> two years ago i drove into a darkness <eos> i straightened every curve on cane ridge road <eos> and i could hear the flapping wings <eos> of every devil i have known <eos> and the inside of my car was like a casket <eos> but then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light <eos> she was calling me back home <eos> and as i pulled into the drive <eos> i knew the servants of the secret fire <eos> were gathered there <eos> the embers of the ages <eos> like a living prayer <eos> she was standing on the porch where i could see <eos> shine your light on me on me <eos> be a light unto my path <eos> and a lamp unto my feet i know youve been afraid <eos> dont know what to do <eos> youve been lost in the questions <eos> i dont know what to say <eos> im sure if i were you <eos> id proceed with some caution <eos> but i want you to know <eos> when the joy that you feel <eos> leaves a terrible ache in your bones <eos> its the voice of jesus <eos> calling you back home <eos> i know youve got a lot <eos> spinning in your head <eos> all this emptiness fills you <eos> maybe you could try <eos> laying in your bed <eos> to ask the silence to still you <eos> and you might hear a beat <eos> on the door of your heart <eos> when you do let it open up wide <eos> its the voice of jesus <eos> calling you his bride <eos> once upon a time there was a little boy <eos> who wandered the forest abandoned <eos> and he heard in the leaves <eos> and behind every tree <eos> the sound of a secret companion <eos> following <eos> so listen little girl <eos> somewhere theres a king <eos> who will love you forever <eos> and nothing in the world <eos> could ever come between <eos> you my love and this lover <eos> so when i kiss you at night <eos> and i turn out the light <eos> and i tell you youre never alone <eos> its the voice of jesus <eos> calling you <eos> its the voice of jesus <eos> calling you his own well we took a train to kensington <eos> and listened to the children run <eos> just beyond the garden gate <eos> where peter and wendy played <eos> there was a sign that said we werent allowed <eos> to duck inside and join the crowd <eos> without a son or daughters hand <eos> to lead us into neverland <eos> and it hurt so bad <eos> but its so good to be young <eos> and i dont want to go back <eos> i just want to go on and on and on <eos> day by day day by day <eos> and everybodys so surprised <eos> when right before your very eyes <eos> your babys in the second grade <eos> you blink and its her wedding day <eos> and we just cant get used to being here <eos> where the ticking clock is loud and clear <eos> children of eternity <eos> on the run from entropy <eos> and it hurts so bad <eos> but its so good to be young <eos> and i dont want to go back <eos> i just want to go on and on and on <eos> day by day day by day <eos> so dont lose heart <eos> though your bodys wasting away <eos> your soul is not <eos> its being remade <eos> day by day by day <eos> well you have never met a single soul <eos> who didnt feel the curses toll <eos> who didnt wish that death would die <eos> maybe thats the reason why <eos> and it hurts so bad <eos> but its so good to be young <eos> and i dont want to go back <eos> i just want to go on and on and on <eos> so dont lose heart <eos> though your bodys wasting away <eos> your soul is not <eos> its being remade <eos> so dont lose heart <eos> dont lose heart <eos> your body will rise and never decay <eos> day by day by day when i look at you boy <eos> i can see the road that lies ahead <eos> i can see the love and the sorrow <eos> bright fields of joy <eos> dark nights awake in a stormy bed <eos> i want to go with you but i cant follow <eos> so keep to the old roads <eos> keep to the old roads <eos> and youll find your way <eos> your first kiss your first crush <eos> the first time you know youre not enough <eos> the first time theres no one there to hold you <eos> the first time you pack it all up <eos> and drive alone across america <eos> please remember the words that i told you <eos> keep to the old roads <eos> keep to the old roads <eos> and youll find your way <eos> youll find your way <eos> if love is what youre looking for <eos> the old roads lead to an open door <eos> and youll find your way <eos> youll find your way <eos> back home <eos> and i know youll be scared when you take up that cross <eos> and i know itll hurt cause i know what it costs <eos> and i love you so much and its so hard to watch <eos> but youre gonna grow up and youre gonna get lost <eos> just go back go back <eos> go back go back to the ancient paths <eos> lash your heart to the ancient mast <eos> and hold on boy whatever you do <eos> to the hope thats taken hold of you <eos> and youll find your way <eos> youll find your way <eos> if love is what youre looking for <eos> the old roads lead to an open door <eos> and youll find your way <eos> youll find your way <eos> back home i remember the day of the tennessee flood <eos> the sound of the scream and the sight of the blood <eos> my son he saw as the animal died <eos> in the jaws of the dog as the river ran by <eos> i said "come back soon" <eos> its there on the page of the book that i read <eos> the boy grew up and the yearling was dead <eos> he stood at the gate with the angel on guard <eos> and wept for the death of his little boy heart <eos> i say "come back soon" <eos> we wake in the night in the womb of the world <eos> we beat our fists on the door <eos> we cannot breathe in this sea that swirls <eos> so we groan in this great darkness <eos> for deliverance <eos> deliverance o lord <eos> i sit on the bench at the bend in the trail <eos> and i can feel in the fall the final exhale <eos> the trees of the field all wring their hands <eos> and the leaves go by like a funeral band <eos> i say "come back soon" <eos> we wake in the night in the womb of the world <eos> we beat our fists on the door <eos> we cannot breathe in this sea that swirls <eos> so we groan in this great darkness <eos> are we alone in this great darkness <eos> if natures red in tooth and in claw <eos> then it seems to me that shes an outlaw <eos> cause every death is a question mark <eos> at the end of the book of a beating heart <eos> and the answer is scrawled in the silent dark <eos> on the dome of the sky in a billion stars <eos> but we cannot read these angel tongues <eos> and we cannot stare at the burning sun <eos> and we cannot sing with these broken lungs <eos> so we kick in the womb and we beg to be born <eos> deliverance <eos> deliverance o lord you are not alone <eos> i will always be with you <eos> even to the end <eos> you dont have to work so hard <eos> you can rest easy <eos> you dont have to prove yourself <eos> youre already mine <eos> you dont have to hide your heart <eos> i already love you <eos> i hold it in mine <eos> so you can rest easy <eos> do not be afraid <eos> nothing nothing in the world <eos> can come between us now <eos> you dont have to work so hard <eos> you can rest easy <eos> you dont have to prove yourself <eos> youre already mine <eos> you dont have to hide your heart <eos> i already love you <eos> i hold it in mine <eos> so you can rest easy <eos> you work so hard to wear yourself down <eos> and youre running like a rodeo clown <eos> youre smiling like youre scared to death <eos> youre out of faith and all out of breath <eos> youre so afraid youve got nowhere left to go <eos> well you are not alone <eos> i will always be with you <eos> you dont have to work so hard <eos> you can rest easy <eos> you dont have to prove yourself <eos> youre already mine <eos> you dont have to hide your heart <eos> i already love you <eos> i hold it in mine <eos> you can rest easy i will hold your hand love <eos> as long as i can love <eos> though the powers rise against us <eos> though your fears assail you <eos> and your body may fail you <eos> theres a fire that burns within us <eos> and we dream in the night <eos> of a city descending <eos> with the sun in the center <eos> and a peace unending <eos> i will carry the fire for you <eos> and we kneel in the water <eos> the sons and the daughters <eos> and we hold our hearts before us <eos> and we look to the distance <eos> and raise our resistance <eos> in the face of the forces <eos> gathered against us <eos> and we dream in the night <eos> of a king and a kingdom <eos> where joy writes the songs <eos> and the innocent sing them <eos> i will carry the fire for you <eos> oh sing on sing on <eos> when your hope is gone <eos> sing on sing on light up the darkness <eos> and we dream in the night <eos> of a feast and a wedding <eos> and the groom in his glory <eos> when the bride is made ready <eos> i will carry the fire for you cant you feel it in your bones <eos> something isnt right here <eos> something that youve always known <eos> but you dont know why <eos> cause every time the sun goes down <eos> we face another night here <eos> waiting for the world to spin around <eos> just to survive <eos> but when you see the morning sun <eos> burning through a silver mist <eos> dont you want to thank someone <eos> dont you want to thank someone for this <eos> dont you ever wonder why <eos> in spite of all thats wrong here <eos> theres still so much that goes so right <eos> and beauty abounds <eos> cause sometimes when you walk outside <eos> the air is full of song here <eos> the thunder rolls and the baby sighs <eos> and the rain comes down <eos> and when you see the spring has come <eos> and it warms you like a mothers kiss <eos> dont you want to thank someone <eos> dont you want to thank someone for this <eos> i used to be a little boy <eos> as golden as a sunrise <eos> breaking over illinois <eos> when the corn was tall <eos> yeah but every little boy grows up <eos> and hes haunted by the heart that died <eos> longing for the world that was <eos> before the fall <eos> oh but then forgiveness comes <eos> a grace that i cannot resist <eos> and i just want to thank someone <eos> i just want to thank someone for this <eos> now i can see the world is charged <eos> its glimmering with promises <eos> written in a script of stars <eos> dripping from prophets lips <eos> but still my thirst is never slaked <eos> i am hounded by a restlessness <eos> eaten by this endless ache <eos> but still i will give thanks for this <eos> cause i can see it in the seas of wheat <eos> i can feel it when the horses run <eos> its howling in the snowy peaks <eos> its blazing in the midnight sun <eos> just behind a veil of wind <eos> a million angels waiting in the wings <eos> a swirling storm of cherubim <eos> making ready for the reckoning <eos> oh how long how long <eos> oh sing on sing on <eos> and when the world is new again <eos> and the children of the king <eos> are ancient in their youth again <eos> maybe its a better thing <eos> a better thing <eos> to be more than merely innocent <eos> but to be broken then redeemed by love <eos> maybe this old world is bent <eos> but its waking up <eos> and im waking up <eos> cause i can hear the voice of one <eos> hes crying in the wilderness <eos> "make ready for the kingdom come" <eos> dont you want to thank someone for this <eos> hallelujah hallelujah <eos> hallelujah hallelujah <eos> come back soon <eos> come back soon i saw the desert wind <eos> tear across the wilderness <eos> i felt it blowing off the page <eos> the teacher told me "son <eos> always remember this" <eos> and i have always been afraid <eos> i read about the god of moses <eos> roaring in the holy cloud <eos> it shook my bedroom window panes <eos> i did not understand then <eos> i do not understand now <eos> i dont expect you to explain <eos> youve been a mystery since the moment that i met you <eos> you never move but i can never seem to catch you <eos> the cornerstone <eos> you said to eat your flesh <eos> before you broke the bread and blessed it <eos> before you poured the wine for every man <eos> this is a hard hard teaching <eos> can any man accept it <eos> can any sage here understand <eos> you turned the tables over <eos> there in your fathers temple <eos> you cracked a whip and raised a shout <eos> my daughter asked me why <eos> i said "love is never simple <eos> it draws em in and drives em out" <eos> i saw you there but it was too late to change my course <eos> and i collided with a beautiful immovable force <eos> and so the stone that i rejected <eos> it has become the cornerstone <eos> all the maps were drawn <eos> but the maps were wrong <eos> the stars spin around <eos> another sun <eos> all the maps were drawn <eos> but the maps were wrong <eos> the rivers are running from <eos> the cornerstone <eos> and you looked me in the eye and fixed me with a permanent stare <eos> i met your gaze and saw the forges of the firmament there <eos> the cornerstone <eos> and the floods come up <eos> and the rains come down do you remember jody baxter <eos> when the whippoorwill sings <eos> how you stole across the pasture <eos> to the little hidden spring <eos> where you laid down by the water <eos> on a bed of spanish moss <eos> and dreamed <eos> when wind was on the prairie <eos> and the fire was in the stove <eos> with the wood you had to carry <eos> from the corner of the grove <eos> and your daddy let you disappear <eos> with all your fishing gear <eos> into the cove <eos> and it was good good good <eos> but now its gone gone gone <eos> and theres a little boy <eos> whos lost out in the woods <eos> always looking for the fawn <eos> i remember jody baxter <eos> when i hid out in the corn <eos> how the clouds were moving faster <eos> with the coming of the storm <eos> and i knew that i had broken <eos> something i could not repair <eos> and i mourned <eos> because the field was green as eden <eos> then it withered into brown <eos> in the middle of my grieving <eos> they came and cut it down <eos> and i was sure that it was all my fault <eos> the day they mowed the garden <eos> to the ground <eos> what was good good good <eos> is gone gone gone <eos> and theres a little boy <eos> whos lost out in the woods <eos> always looking for the fawn <eos> so come back to me <eos> please come back to me <eos> is there any way that we can <eos> change the ending of this tragedy <eos> or does it have to be this way <eos> i can see you jody baxter <eos> now youre broken by the years <eos> as you lie down in the aster <eos> and listen for the deer <eos> and im a million miles away <eos> but i still pray the fawn can find me <eos> here do you remember how we used to drive <eos> over the mountain and down to the river bend <eos> where the ghosts of the valley all haunt the tracks <eos> the highway calls your stories back again <eos> oh jamie im all alone out here and all i used to know is in the wind <eos> and now i dont recognize a thing <eos> i need a brand new song to sing <eos> so tell me the story i still need to hear <eos> tell me were gonna make it out alive again <eos> i need to know theres nothing left to fear theres nothing left to hide <eos> so will you look me in the eye and say we will survive <eos> someday the truths gonna lay us bare <eos> were gonna raise a glass to the past and say <eos> its only when the straight line breaks and heals a little crooked <eos> that you ever see the grace <eos> well i had to find a better place maybe the bend in the rivers the only way <eos> and im lost got all these voices in my head <eos> i need some hope up there instead <eos> so tell me the story i still need to hear <eos> tell me about the sun thats gonna rise again <eos> i need to know theres nothing left to fear theres nothing left to hide <eos> so will you look me in the eye and say we will survive <eos> we will survive <eos> do you remember how i used to say <eos> love is a fire and its gonna burn us up <eos> to make the space for grace to grow <eos> well now it feels like love has called my bluff <eos> so tell me the story i still need to hear <eos> tell me about the love that never dies <eos> tell me the story i still need to hear <eos> tell me were gonna make it out alive again <eos> i need to know theres nothing left to fear <eos> theres nothing left to hide <eos> so when you look me in the eye i know we will survive <eos> we will survive <eos> i know we will survive <eos> i know we will survive you got all that emotion thats heaving like an ocean <eos> and youre drowning in a deep dark well <eos> i can hear it in your voice that if you only had a choice <eos> you would rather be anyone else <eos> i love you just the way that you are <eos> i love the way he made your precious heart <eos> be kind to yourself be kind to yourself <eos> i know its hard to hear it when that anger in your spirit <eos> is pointed like an arrow at your chest <eos> when the voices in your mind are anything but kind <eos> and you cant believe your <eos> father knows best <eos> i love you just the way that you are <eos> i love the way hes shaping your heart <eos> be kind to yourself <eos> be kind to yourself <eos> how does it end when the war that youre in <eos> is just you against you against you <eos> gotta learn to love learn to love <eos> learn to love your enemies too <eos> you cant expect to be perfect <eos> its a fight youve gotta forfeit <eos> you belong to me whatever you do <eos> so lay down your weapon darling <eos> take a deep breath and believe that i love you <eos> be kind to yourself <eos> be kind to yourself <eos> be kind to yourself <eos> gotta learn to love learn to love learn to love your enemies <eos> gotta learn to love learn to love learn to love your enemies too and when the winter is over <eos> the flowers climb through the snow <eos> the willows weep and the clover bloom <eos> then all at once you hear a song <eos> thats stronger than the noise <eos> rejoice <eos> rejoice <eos> and when the peace turns to danger <eos> the nights are longer than days <eos> and every friend has a strangers face <eos> then deep within the dungeon cell <eos> you have to make a choice <eos> rejoice <eos> rejoice <eos> rejoice <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> rejoice <eos> be still and know that the father <eos> will hasten down from his throne <eos> he will rejoice over you with song <eos> so set your face against the night <eos> and raise your broken voice <eos> rejoice <eos> rejoice <eos> rejoice <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> and again i say <eos> rejoice well i want to say im sorry but i dont know how <eos> but im sorry im so sorry now <eos> i said some words to you i wish i never said <eos> i know words can kill cause somethings dead <eos> and now my heart is like a catacomb <eos> and im praying we can find a way to raise these bones <eos> again oh again <eos> well i want to say im sorry but its not enough <eos> to close the wounds i opened up <eos> so now ive got this sorrow and youve got that hurt <eos> and we cant go back to who we were <eos> oh but could that mean im someone new <eos> maybe i can love you better than i failed to do <eos> before the war <eos> theyll tell you everything was beautiful and pure <eos> but there was poison in the well from years before <eos> and now im cleaning up this wreckage on the shore <eos> and i dont want to fight with you no more <eos> so i want to say im sorry that i drew the line <eos> i built the wall the fault is mine <eos> and maybe now the only way to find some peace <eos> is just to give it time and trust in grace <eos> so this is my communion hymn <eos> i want to sit beside you at the feast my friend <eos> again again and again <eos> and again oh god i am furrowed like the field <eos> torn open like the dirt <eos> and i know that to be healed <eos> that i must be broken first <eos> i am aching for the yield <eos> that you will harvest from this hurt <eos> abide in me <eos> let these branches bear you fruit <eos> abide in me lord <eos> as i abide in you <eos> so i kneel <eos> at the bright edge of the garden <eos> at the golden edge of dawn <eos> at the glowing edge of spring <eos> when the winters edge is gone <eos> and i can see the color green <eos> i can hear the sowers song <eos> abide in me <eos> let these branches bear you fruit <eos> abide in me lord <eos> let your word take root <eos> remove in me <eos> the branch that bears no fruit <eos> and move in me lord <eos> as i abide in you <eos> as the rain and the snow fall <eos> down from the sky <eos> and they dont return but they water the earth and bring they forth life <eos> giving seed to the sower bread for the hunger <eos> so shall the word of the lord be with a sound like thunder <eos> and it will not return it will not return void <eos> we shall be led in peace <eos> and go out with joy <eos> and the hills before us <eos> will raise their voices <eos> and the trees of the field will clap their hands as the land rejoices <eos> and instead of the thorn now <eos> the cypress towers <eos> and instead of the briar the myrtle blooms with a thousand flowers <eos> and it will make a name <eos> make a name for our god <eos> a sign everlasting that will never be cut off <eos> as the earth brings forth sprouts from the seed <eos> what is sown in the garden grows into a mighty tree <eos> so the lord plants justice justice and praise <eos> to rise before the nations till the end of days <eos> as the rain and the snow fall <eos> down from the sky <eos> and they dont return but they water the earth and they bring forth life <eos> giving seed to the sower and bread for the hunger <eos> so shall the word of the lord be with a sound like thunder <eos> and it will not return it will not return void <eos> it will not return it will not return void <eos> it will not return it will not return void <eos> we shall be led in peace <eos> and go out with joy <eos> and the sower leads us <eos> and the sower leads us <eos> and the sower leads us i never see your crazy face <eos> smiling laughing screaming my name like that <eos> suddenly your eyes disappear in the night <eos> i run as fast as i can <eos> its strange its

where my heart has gently grown <eos> and where the trees are in bloom forever <eos> i could spend my whole life with you <eos> under a shady grove just waiting for the stars <eos> we would have a shelter at the top of the highest tree <eos> we would look at the sky before we sleep <eos> promise me we will live underneath the stars <eos> the nightengale will sing "la la la la la" <eos> its a sweet song <eos> underneath the stars <eos> we would be lovers from the hill <eos> by the hazy mountains my loves sweetly grown <eos> and where the secrets are kept forever <eos> i could spend a lifetime with you <eos> under a white maple tree staring at the skies <eos> we would have a shelter at the top of the highest tree <eos> we would look at the sky before we sleep <eos> promise me we will live underneath the stars <eos> the nightengale will sing "la la la la la" <eos> its a sweet song <eos> underneath the stars <eos> we would be lovers from the hill <eos> promise me we will live underneath the stars <eos> the nightengale will sing "la la la la la" <eos> its a sweet song <eos> underneath the stars <eos> we would be lovers from the hill cest une histoire <eos> du temps passã©

its fall <eos> streets shine like a mirror ball <eos> sun comes on its just enough <eos> watch the flowers waking up <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> colors run and they fade away <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> feel the threads like new again <eos> big machines all in a row <eos> mother with her child in tow <eos> change old paper for silver coins <eos> lose myself in all this noise <eos> wake up from a peaceful rest <eos> counting down one minute left <eos> cotton stops its jog in place <eos> i hold it warm against my face <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> colors run and they fade away <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> feel the threads like new again <eos> whats this in my dungarees <eos> in my back pocket curled and creased <eos> my old notebook filled with you <eos> our secrets now just streaks of blue <eos> its all a mess but beautiful <eos> this emptiness a gift i hold <eos> i write a poem with you in mind <eos> and leave the memories behind <eos> i leave the memories behind <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> colors run and they fade away <eos> its washing day its washing day <eos> feel the threads like new again <eos> feel the threads like new again <eos> feel the threads like new again i like missing you in the mornings <eos> when the airs too cold to feel nice <eos> and i like hearing your sneakers stomping <eos> down the stairs when you stomp out of sight <eos> and i like how all your walls surround you <eos> so that i cant ever come inside <eos> and i like holding you and then falling down <eos> i like feeling your arms around me <eos> and then sneaking out in the morning light <eos> and i like going away sometimes <eos> for a lonely day and a lonely night <eos> and i like singing my nonsense loudly <eos> and then whispering the things i hide <eos> and i like holding you and then falling down <eos> oh and i like you when youre out of view <eos> cause i have this perfect picture in my mind <eos> and i like you and it feels so true <eos> cause i have this perfect picture yeah <eos> and its become a fixture <eos> this pretty pretty picture of you in my mind <eos> i like trying to read your scribbles <eos> because they keep me guessing everytime <eos> and i like wondering if you want me <eos> and then you tell me this feels just right <eos> and i like waking up in the mornings <eos> as our shadows get flushed by the light <eos> and i like holding you and then falling down <eos> im falling down <eos> im falling down <eos> im falling down you always loved the colors and the details so heres mine i snuck out down a dark th street late last night i took my little orange book lamp and the notebook with the stars on the front the sleeping bag that my ex gave to me to keep me warm and a black fountain pen to write the words that it was too late to say out loud <eos> and my eyes turned green like they do when im crying and my heart it went to blue cause you told me that i might not be what you need you want to try more out but youre the only thing i cant stop thinking about <eos> yeah i like you a lot and i think its worse than that <eos> you said you love it when all the words in a song move really fast and your ears have to choose just one little phrase to hold on to and you love it when all the chords are really simple so you can play it on the guitar and then when it goes to a funny one at the end you like that too insert funny chord here and so ill build you a song and i know youre gonna love it cause im putting in all the pieces that you said you wanted in it and im writing it here in my room in just my underwear and an orange tshirt cause i know that youd think that was hot <eos> yeah hot like that day that you called sick for work because wed stayed out too late at the cheesecake factory the night before and we held hands on the beach and i found that crab in a funny shell and you took video of me holding it up by the newly painted blue motel and you said "i like you a lot" and i thought well this couldnt get much better <eos> you said you were so happy you met me when you did cause you were starting to think you didnt like people and you told me that when i moved that i could still stay in your room for weeks but now im wondering if i imagined it or if it was ever really there cause they say even in magic nothing truly disappears it just gets stuffed up somebodys sleeve or behind their hand or on top of their head and you forgot to keep your eye on it you were looking down instead <eos> so now im the fool up on stage at the magic show searching the deck for my card while everyone laughs because they know that its in plain sight to see yeah its stuck on your forehead but i cant think youre mean cause i volunteered to be misled <eos> yeah cause i like you a lot but i dont know what to do with it now <eos> and i like you a lot but i didnt think itd hurt this bad <eos> and i like you a lot and we both know that its worse than that too young to understand why she went away <eos> too old to admit that i wouldnt be okay <eos> so i hardened my heart that day <eos> i wiped the feelings off my face <eos> she said it was her and it wasnt my fault <eos> it wasnt my fault <eos> but when somebody leaves <eos> just like they all do <eos> its easy to think <eos> that it might be you <eos> when somebody leaves <eos> like they all do <eos> it aint easy <eos> his eyes told me we were through and hed be okay <eos> i just looked down as my true love walked away <eos> and it hardened my heart that day <eos> but i wiped the feelings off my face <eos> he said it was him <eos> and it wasnt my fault <eos> was it my fault <eos> cause when somebody leaves <eos> like they all do <eos> its easy to think <eos> that it might be you <eos> when somebody leaves <eos> like they all do <eos> it aint easy <eos> but i will stay strong and i will stay busy and <eos> i wont lean too much to your side <eos> and in july well call it freedom <eos> and one day this sheen that covers my eyes <eos> will melt away <eos> itll fall drip down by the wayside <eos> i just need time <eos> this town was feeling so small and i needed space <eos> so i packed my things in my blue suitcase and i drove away <eos> but it hardened my heart that day <eos> when he wiped his feelings off his face <eos> cause he thought it was him <eos> but it wasnt his fault <eos> no it was just me <eos> but when somebody leaves <eos> like we all do <eos> its easy to think <eos> that it might be you <eos> when somebody leaves <eos> like we all do <eos> it aint easy <eos> it aint easy <eos> it aint easy suddenly youre shaken with pain <eos> shooting down inside you <eos> and now youre crumbling away <eos> but this isnt like you <eos> it doesnt stop til it breaks down all you know <eos> your breathing locks and your balance goes <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> it takes a minute <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> it doesnt finish <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> youre breaking faster <eos> ladadadadada <eos> youre nothing after <eos> theres nothing after <eos> you try to make your escape <eos> but the blows keep on coming <eos> and as the dust clears away <eos> you start to notice something <eos> each time a piece crashes down into the floor <eos> youre a little lighter than just before <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> it takes a minute <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> it doesnt finish <eos> ladadadadadadada <eos> youll see it after <eos> ladadadadada <eos> when you look backwards <eos> when you look backwards bouncy ball lovers <eos> exploding in colors as they <eos> lean down over the pier <eos> move like the tide <eos> on an october night <eos> and they laugh <eos> till they run out of air <eos> the moon sets <eos> beneath the ocean line <eos> watch it go down down <eos> as their emotions <eos> start to rise <eos> far away sound <eos> of the waves <eos> unchosen their strides <eos> slowly they open <eos> like arms <eos> that were folded <eos> like eyes <eos> that woke up in the sun <eos> cautious to feel <eos> and anxious to heal <eos> this loneliness <eos> that had begun <eos> she fell in the bed <eos> in his arms <eos> they tumbled around <eos> their heads lost <eos> beneath eachothers hearts <eos> the walls were surrounded <eos> in unfinished art <eos> they fit together <eos> like love on a letter <eos> like tulips <eos> on a table for two <eos> and on that same day <eos> as she left for santa fe <eos> he said <eos> "im rather crazy for you" <eos> and he brushed down <eos> his hair to one side <eos> and he went through the rounds <eos> of his knuckles popping <eos> from the left to the right <eos> he took out his canvas <eos> and painted bluegreen lines <eos> oo oo oo had my canvas primed in white some water by my bed a wooden palette smeared with reds and gray s and blues dipped my brush into the paint traced the outline of your face then i washed it clean for color number two theres a little drop of paint in a mason jar of water that turned every last ounce a crimson hue and its the same with you you had a minute with my heart now you color everything that i do stew pots on the boil house was filled with steam bowls and spoons in twos like noahs ark dash of salt and spice to make it like you like bring it to my lips and there you are theres a little pinch of salt in a ladle full of comfort that opens all the flavors into bloom and its the same with you you had a minute with my heart and now you color everything that i do a flower turns its face to the sun snow melting makes the river run tide rises high to meet the moon meet the moon theres an echo in my ear sounding like your voice a feeling that fills any empty room you had a minute with my heart and i live it every day cause when you brushed against my heart it soaked through and now my whole world is tinted with you yeah you color everything that i do in the creases <eos> youre the smell of the toast that you made in the mornings <eos> youre the page in my book that i keep to myself <eos> youre the unlocking sound when i turn my door key <eos> youre the scar that i have from the time that i fell <eos> i cant describe the faces <eos> i cant recall the names <eos> but you remain <eos> i keep you in the creases <eos> i hide you in the folds <eos> protect you from the sunlight <eos> shield you from the cold <eos> everybody said they were glad to see you go <eos> but no one ever has to know <eos> youre the part of the moon that blends into the blackness <eos> even though we know its really still there <eos> youre the song that i sing and i dont need to practice <eos> youre the green shirt i keep though its too small to wear <eos> i cant describe the faces <eos> i cant recall the names <eos> but you remain <eos> i keep you in the creases <eos> i hide you in the folds <eos> protect you from the sunlight <eos> shield you from the cold <eos> everybody said they were glad to see you go <eos> but no one ever has to <eos> no one ever has to know the things that i refuse to see <eos> and all the nights i still cant sleep <eos> i curl up in the sheets <eos> between the creases where you used to be <eos> once love wakes it never sleeps <eos> even when you love a dream i found a little pot took it in the kitchen <eos> and filled it with some dirt planted a chrysanthemum <eos> and you shouldve seen how it turned my mood to yellow <eos> it turned my mood to yellow in a day <eos> i read about a boy who suffered depression <eos> his parents hung a mirror inside his bedroom <eos> and they made him smile at it three times a day <eos> til it took his depression away <eos> and it goes to show that theres a natural way <eos> of healing what were feeling inside <eos> it goes to show that before we prescribe <eos> we should first try a simple smile <eos> so i drive out to the middle of nowhere <eos> and i turn little as i stare up at the stars in the sky <eos> and these heavens erase any worries i face <eos> if i look up once in a while <eos> and it goes to show that theres a natural way <eos> of healing what were feeling inside <eos> it goes to show that before we prescribe <eos> we should first try a simple smile <eos> give it a <eos> smile smile smile <eos> just a little <eos> smile smile smile he recognized the fracture line and asked <eos> how bads the pain <eos> i said its feeling worse than ever cant you make it go away <eos> he studied my heart up and down and said <eos> ive never seen one quite this bad <eos> ill wrap it up if you want me to but i <eos> must be warning you <eos> a split wont work a cast wont last <eos> a bandaid will come unglued <eos> the only way to heal your heart <eos> is keeping loving til one loves you <eos> ooh the doctor said its true <eos> ooh now get better soon <eos> well i knew that i couldnt wait and hed walked out the door <eos> so i grabbed the novacaine and some pills from his drawer <eos> and when i got home i held my heart and <eos> bandaged all those ugly scars <eos> numbed the pain and popped the pills until my heart went still <eos> and life just passed by every day like every day before <eos> i felt no love i felt no pain <eos> i played my part and nothing more <eos> ooh the doctor said its true <eos> oooh now get better soon <eos> i couldnt stand the pain <eos> i couldnt stand the pain <eos> i couldnt stand the pain so i washed it away <eos> i couldnt stand the pain <eos> i ran into the doc last weekend at the grocery superstore <eos> he asked me hows it feeling and i said its barely sore <eos> but he saw my eyes so dark and blank and that <eos> practiced smile on my face <eos> he said theres one more thing to do and i think it might cure you <eos> write down everything you loved about the one you knew <eos> then love yourself in that same way and in no time youll be brand new <eos> ooh the doctor said its true <eos> oooh now get better soon <eos> ooh get better soon <eos> ooh get better soon <eos> the doctor said today it can all go away <eos> now get better soon show your weakness <eos> let <eos> your tears fall when youre <eos> feeling blue <eos> show your <eos> weakness <eos> ill be on your side <eos> even when you lose

on to another heart <eos> while i was picking mine up with its broken parts <eos> i did it to him you did it to me <eos> shell do it to you cause were years old <eos> and thats what we do when were <eos> and i still remember watching you in november <eos> like a hollywood movie on the silver screen <eos> and you looked so good in d <eos> that i fell blindly for you like hed fallen for me <eos> and i recognized the same look in your eye yesterday <eos> as you watched her through your camera with the splitsecond delay <eos> i did it to him you did it to me <eos> youre next on the list cause shes years old <eos> and thats what we do when were <eos> and i wouldnt take it back cause now i know more about me <eos> but i shouldve had a laugh earlier cause its pretty silly <eos> how we slide along the winning edge and the losing edge and the middle <eos> and we dance around and poke ourselves on this love triangle <eos> i did it to him you did it to me <eos> shes doing it to you we should start dating people that are at least <eos> cause thats what we do when were years old <eos> and thats only half of the stupid stuff we do when were years old <eos> and thats what we do when were nu r

thoughts without words to convey <eos> feeling so helpless from so far away <eos> watching the world setting free <eos> so many angels all in one day <eos> we will remember theres no other way <eos> how in the world do we ever repay <eos> so many angels <eos> such a long road but weve made it to here <eos> a step at a time in an ocean of tears <eos> hoping there wont be a day thats so hard to get through <eos> some need to fight to believe theres an end <eos> others in silence live a requiem <eos> living in honour of you <eos> so many angels all in one day <eos> we will remember theres no other way <eos> how in the world do we ever repay <eos> so many angels <eos> so many angels all in one day <eos> we will remember theres no other way <eos> how in the world do we ever repay <eos> so many angels <eos> so many angels <eos> so many angels <eos> so many angels every lover knows this song too well <eos> finding out whos love they need <eos> some can sing it and some can tell <eos> others just cant find the key <eos> there is a magic that lasts through time <eos> some fall under its spell <eos> i hope that someday the future is kind <eos> so i can finally tell <eos> somebody somewhere that they mean the world to me <eos> i hope that somebody somewhere can set this heart free <eos> i know that somebody somewhere can show me the way <eos> love can be i know that somebody somewhere is waiting for me <eos> if i could have any wish on a star <eos> in a world where that dreams do come true <eos> my wish would find you wherever you are <eos> so i can finally say to <eos>

forget to duck at doorways and often hed get hurt <eos> i took good care of him for he had no family <eos> actually he did but he forgot who they be <eos> johnny often liked to go out on the town <eos> hed forget where hed be going so hed just wander around <eos> i knew when he was back for i would hear the smack <eos> of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack <eos> johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace <eos> but wherever its alying theres a smile upon his face <eos> i should have seen it coming he finally lost his mind <eos> but if his head dont turn up soon then all his hats are mine <eos> johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped <eos> as if trying to think of something but having no luck <eos> still he didnt notice that his head werent there <eos> til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair <eos> i said "johnny wheres your cranium" but he didnt seem to know <eos> he just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose <eos> and the sight of him there topless made me start to cry <eos> for i feared wed neer again see eye to eye <eos> johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace <eos> but wherever its alying theres a smile upon his face <eos> i should have seen it coming he should have stayed in bed <eos> for now i fear hell spend his life just trying to get ahead <eos> refusing to believe that he had split for good <eos> his lower half and me searched the neighbourhood <eos> it soon became apparent that his head we wouldnt find it <eos> he could not retrace his steps he was absent minded <eos> well years went by til late one night i heard a voice i swore <eos> was johnny calling out to me i flung open the door <eos> johnnys head was home it took a taxi cab <eos> alas it was too late his body had gone bad <eos> johnnys head was homeless his body was cremated <eos> and the funeral was harder than he had anticipated <eos> i should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy <eos> but never thought id have to say i aint got nobody <eos> i aint got nobody <eos> johnny came home headless it was a great disgrace <eos> but now his heads upon a shelf a smile upon his face <eos> but now his heads upon a shelf a smile upon his face and heres a letter from bill macy of gainesville florida <eos> it appears to me that gainsville sun is withholding information from the public <eos> recently there was a fourcolumn spread about a probable murder from a gun <eos> another item tells of a shooting death in key biscaine <eos> a third item tells us of a soldier shooting his wife and children <eos> i can count on such reports in about every issue of the sun <eos> we can be sure of many more incidents have occured of people being protected from injury or death because they had a gun <eos> these reports can be easily obtained from the national rifle association <eos> i am sure they keep accurate records of such protection <eos> the failure to report these cases of protection is not fair <eos> i urge you to correct this <eos> i suggest a small box in every paper called "protected by guns" <eos> simply insert the number of such protections <eos> on those rare days when none are noted simply put a zero in the box <eos> thanks bill through the ages through war pestilence and sleet the celtic culture has survived its songs and dances passed from father to son from mother to daughter from uncle to goat and though

tried to destroy them driven no doubt by their jealousy of the celts fine fashion sense and edible cuisine they did not surrender actually they surrendered quite often but they were never entirely wiped out clinging to the corners of small islands their voices raised in song the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens <eos> undescribably beautiful pennywhistle solo <eos> ah ma wee

till you ran off with that brilliant young premed <eos> my pain would show up on a catscan <eos> my optic nerves are only seeing blue <eos> my blood hates to flow <eos> because it has to go <eos> through the fourchambered heart that cries for you <eos> im in the lonely lab of broken hearts <eos> i dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart <eos> im in the lonely lab of feelin blue <eos> and my pheremones can find no trace of you <eos> you were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates <eos> the rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears <eos> i wanted to elope <eos> so we could make some isotopes <eos> with a halflife of a million thousand years <eos> if i suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here <eos> my muscles would need atipianarobic respiration <eos> adenine cidozine guanine and thianine <eos> might make up my dna <eos> but my love gene must be missin from its station <eos> im in the lonely lab of broken hearts <eos> i dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart <eos> im in the lonely lab of feelin blue <eos> and my pheremones can find no trace of you <eos> the metallurgist is the musicians best friend this statement <eos> has been echoed throughout the ages for without the metallurgist we <eos> could not have such musical things as triangles cymbals margerine <eos> tubs or guitar strings guitar strings are produced by the <eos> wiredrawing process where solid metal is pulled through dies with <eos> progressively smaller diameters until the desired diameter or guage <eos> is reached the ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility <eos> and seperates metals from other materials such as wood ceramics or <eos> plastic milk jugs which are made by the blowmolding process you <eos> put the milk in later <eos> im in the lonely lab of broken hearts <eos> i dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart <eos> im in the lonely lab of feelin blue <eos> and my pheremones can find no trace of you <eos> im in the lonely lab of broken hearts <eos> i dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart <eos> im in the lonely lab of feelin blue <eos> and my pheremones can find no trace of you

most tears <eos> for ive had the same christmas cake for almost thirty years <eos> granny made it back in sixtyeight and gave it to my mom <eos> who gave it to her uncle who gave it to her son <eos> who then gave it to me and that is where it stuck <eos> for i was only three months old and clearly out of luck <eos> each christmas of my childhood that fruitbrick would return <eos> my mom would place it on a plate and tell me i must learn <eos> that it is rude to get a gift and not put it to use <eos> and every year id take a bite and chip another tooth <eos> after fifteen years of misery id had all i could take <eos> that summer i went camping and dropped it in the lake <eos> i thought that i was rid of it but on christmas eve <eos> there it was "from santa claus" under the christmas tree <eos> each year id try to lose it but it would just return <eos> so i cried out "oh why have i been given such a burden" <eos> a voice replied "its not a curse but the greatest gift" <eos> "for when all else abandons you you will still have it" <eos> for all of mans creations slowly waste away <eos> relationships do crumble and buildings do decay <eos> the pyramids and stonehenge slowly disappear <eos> but if they were made of christmas cake theyd last a million years im proud to be a banker <eos> im proud to be a banker <eos> im proud to be a banker <eos> cause i get to play with other peoples money <eos> im having a lousy day <eos> i burn my toast and spill my coffee <eos> on my best shirt so i had to change and then <eos> im late for work so i rush into the meeting <eos> where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is <eos> and i dont really give a damn <eos> but i dont have another job <eos> and so i lie and say <eos> im proud to be a banker <eos> im proud to be a banker <eos> im proud to be a banker <eos> cause i get to talk to stimulating people <eos> i open up my mail <eos> hoping that its not a bill but its from the bank <eos> saying that i have only hours to go <eos> to contribute to my rrsp for this tax year <eos> so i run down to the bank but theres a mile lineup <eos> and im yelling and im screaming <eos> and im not wearing any pants

<eos> i tanned myself to perfection <eos> but the sun can give you a cancerous infection <eos> so now im white and pasty and i never leave the house <eos> i used to eat like there was no tomorrow

till one day on the parking lot <eos> they called fourohone <eos> my car became the meat between <eos> a buickhonda bun <eos> i saw some parts go flying <eos> that you really need to drive <eos> my car had become roadkill <eos> though it never was alive <eos> left a muffler in the passing lane <eos> a hubcap in the slow <eos> the windshield on the median <eos> a headlight in the snow <eos> and as i skidded off the road <eos> the other drivers laughed <eos> my middlefinger greeting <eos> would be my epitaph <eos> death would come at last here lies the man who dared to drive <eos> horizon

long as we keep quebec <eos> the usa has tanks and switzerland has banks <eos> they can keep them thanks they just dont amount <eos> cause when you get down to it you find out what the truth <eos> is <eos> it isnt what you do with it its the size that counts <eos> most people will tell you that france is pretty large <eos> but you can put fourteen frances into this land of ours <eos> itd take a

peoples imagination <eos> but now im forced into some reconsideration <eos> cause somethings happened to my cat <eos> that deserves some explanation <eos> william shakespeares in my cat <eos> my kitty is the bard <eos> he used to be a playwright <eos> now hes digging up the yard <eos> hes still a cat in most respects <eos> he likes to meow and purr <eos> but now i introduce him as the cat <eos> that wrote richard the third <eos> i took him to see phantom <eos> he said it was quite nice <eos> but he cant go see miss saigon <eos> until he kills some mice <eos> until he kills some mice <eos> william shakespeares in my cat <eos> it sometimes seems so deep <eos> the guy who wrote twelfth night <eos> chews on my socks while im asleep <eos> im really quite impressed <eos> i own the cat who wrote macbeth <eos> but if somethings rotten in this state <eos> its just his fishy breath <eos> cause he wrote romeo and juliet <eos> but his greatest story yet <eos> is coming back as someones pet <eos> and gettin neutered by the vet <eos> he got his paws caught in a net <eos> then he said to be or not to meeeow <eos> william shakespeares in my cat <eos> he rarely ever talks <eos> he makes his loudest statements <eos> standing in the litter box <eos> he sleeps on all my shelves <eos> and throws my books about the house <eos> it doesnt sound like prose <eos> when he bats a squeaky mouse <eos> sam becketts plays are witty <eos> same thing for bernard shaw <eos> oscar wilde is pretty <eos> but none of them have paws <eos> none of them have paws <eos> william shakespeares in my cat <eos> he chases bits of fluff <eos> john miltons in my goldfish <eos> but i never liked his stuff <eos> im thinking that franz kafka <eos> really came back as a bug <eos> and i hope andrew lloyd webber <eos> will stay underneath my rug <eos> cause he wrote romeo and juliet <eos> but his greatest story yet <eos> is coming back as someones pet <eos> and gettin neutered by the vet <eos> he got his paws caught in a net <eos> then he said to be or not to meeeow <eos> take it trevor <eos> he wrote romeo and juliet <eos> but his greatest story yet <eos> is coming back as someones pet <eos> and gettin neutered by the vet <eos> he got his paws caught in a net <eos> then he said to be or not to meeeow this year at christmas everybodys feeling funny <eos> no ones making joyful sounds <eos> cranberry sauce aint staying down <eos> the lineups at the bathroom are longer than at the mall <eos> everybodys meeting vincent <eos> the christmas virus <eos> vincent the christmas virus <eos> hes the one thatll keep you up all night <eos> hes the festive parasite <eos> vincent the christmas virus <eos> vincent the christmas virus is resistant to penicillin <eos> doesnt notice aspirin <eos> dont matter if youre fit and trim <eos> but vincents not immune to the effects of alcohol <eos> so get real drunk on christmas day <eos> lets all toast to vincent hooray ooooh come back proud canadians <eos> to before you had tv <eos> no hockey night in canada <eos> there was no cbc oh my god <eos> in maddison was mad <eos> he was the president you know <eos> well he thought hed tell the british <eos> where they aught to go <eos> he thought hed invade canada <eos> he thought that he was tough <eos> instead we went to washingon <eos> chorus <eos> and burned down all his stuff <eos> and the white house burned burned burned down <eos> and were the ones that did it <eos> it burned burned burned <eos> while the president ran and cried <eos> it burned burned burned down <eos> and things were very historical <eos> and the americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies yeah <eos> wah wah wah <eos> in the war of <eos> us hillbillies from kentucky <eos> dressed in green and red <eos> left home to fight in canada <eos> but the returned home dead <eos> its the only war the yankees lost <eos> except for vietnam <eos> and also the alamo <eos> and the bay of ham <eos> the loser was america <eos> the winner was ourselves <eos> so join right in and gloat about <eos> the war of <eos> chorus <eos> in we were just sittin around <eos> puttin crops into the ground <eos> we heard the soldiers coming and we didnt like that sound <eos> so we took a boat to washington <eos> and burned it to the ground <eos> ooooh we fired our guns but the yankees keptacomin <eos> there wasnt quite as many as there was a while ago <eos> we fired once more and the yankees started runnin <eos> down the mississippi to the gulf of mexicoooooooooooooo <eos> they ran through the snow and they ran through the forest <eos> they ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldnt go <eos> the ran so fast they forgot to take their culture <eos> back to america and the gulf of mexicoooooooo <eos> so if you go to washington <eos> its buildings clean and nice <eos> bring a pack of matches <eos> and well burn the white house twice <eos> and the whitehouse burned burned burned <eos> but the americans wont admit it <eos> it burned burned burned <eos> it burned it burned it burned <eos> it burned burned burned <eos> how that made them mad <eos> and the americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies <eos> wah wah wah <eos> in the war of dragged out one year i got a dog for christmas <eos> and i gave it to the boy next door <eos> then i gave him my bike and my moms bank card <eos> cause thats what christmas is for <eos> i used to give a lot at christmas <eos> you might say i gave to much <eos> until my family was broke and we had no place to live <eos> thats why christmas sucks <eos> i went down to the mall each christmas <eos> had to the santa what to bring <eos> a train a bike a pony and a great big pile of cash <eos> and please dont get my sister anything <eos> but the

them all <eos> chorus <eos> cause malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw <eos> malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw <eos> malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw <eos> and he never has the same problem twice <eos> whether its a bill or a cheque arriving late <eos> rancid marble cheese or a steak thats second rate <eos> awful tv programs or a broken elvis plate <eos> or his fiancee who dumps him because hes gaining weight <eos> chorus <eos> and he goes <eos> aaaaggghhh aaaaggghhh <eos> problem solved when christmas rolls around santas busy in his shop <eos> managing his elves and trying to cut costs <eos> his plant is out of date it needs modernization <eos> he has quite a large debt accumulation <eos> elves are expensive they do not come cheap <eos> and you would not believe the bills for the heat <eos> santa stands to lose everything he owns <eos> if he defaults on yet another of his loans <eos> things are looking bad for santa <eos> he can slip down chimneys but he cant balance accounts <eos> things are looking bad for santa <eos> if he wrote a cheque it probably would bounce <eos> he hires an accountant to come and advise <eos> the accountant says that he has been unwise <eos> cause even if the costs were cut down drastically <eos> its still hard to make money giving things away for free <eos> santa claus decides to wipe the slate clean <eos> he lays off half the elves and buys mordern machines <eos> then he auctions off all unnecessary stock <eos> he gets a lot for rudolf from ripleys believe it or not <eos> things are looking bad for santa <eos> hes made all sorts of changes but it hasnt fixed a thing <eos> things are looking bad for santa <eos> missus claus has left him and the elves are picketing <eos> hey hey ho ho the big fat pig has got to go <eos> hey hey ho ho the big fat pig has got to go <eos> santas had enough he locks the elves outside <eos> he butchers all the reindeer and sells off all their hides <eos> he sells his shop to disney and leaves the north pole <eos> to go find cheaper labour down in mexico wouldnt it be great if everybody had a gun <eos> wouldnt it be great if everybody had a gun <eos> thered be no more

fist at some boys who were down by the crick <eos> their feet in the water their hands on their <eos> marbles and play things and at half past four <eos> there came a young lady she looked like a <eos> pretty young creature she sat on the grass <eos> she pulled up her dress and she showed them her <eos> ruffles and laces and a white fluffy duck <eos> she said she was learning a new way to <eos> bring up her children so they would not spit <eos> while the boys in the barnyard were shoveling <eos> refuse and litter from yesterdays hunt <eos> while the girl in the meadow was rubbing her <eos> eyes at the fellow down by the dock <eos> he looked like a man with a sizable <eos> home in the country with a big fence out front <eos> if he asked her politely shed show him her <eos> little pet dog who was subject to fits <eos> and maybe shed let him grab hold of her <eos> small tender hands with a movement so quick <eos> and then shed bend over and suck on his <eos> candy so tasty made of butterscotch <eos> and then hed spread whipped cream all over her <eos> cookies that she had left out on her shelf <eos> if you think this is dirty you can go fuck yourself our love is like a new

year since i last saw her <eos> so many faces and a room full of strangers <eos> yet all i could hear was her name <eos> so many words that were left unsaid <eos> yet all we could say here and now was hey there <eos> i thought i moved on until i looked her way <eos> chorus <eos> never planned to see you here in my zone <eos> thought i had myself back once you were gone <eos> but when i see you smile deep inside i know <eos> im just not over you <eos> verse <eos> i barely remember her kiss her lips her touch <eos> i barely remember when she used to give me all of her love <eos> my funny valentine in my heart she will always shine <eos> now look what this girl done did to me <eos> that boy songz said it best cause its happening baby <eos> will she ever know that she cut me deep <eos> couldnt be her friend again cause that would kill me <eos> and i <eos> chorus <eos> never planned to see you here in my zone <eos> thought i had myself back once you were gone <eos> but when i see you smile deep inside i know <eos> im just not over you <eos> im just not over you <eos> verse <eos> my first true love and my greatest pain <eos> who thought youd ever be one in the same <eos> thought i had you out my life <eos> now youre walking back in <eos> girl you know that just aint right <eos> cause i <eos> chorus <eos> never planned to see you here in my zone <eos> thought i had myself back once you were gone <eos> but when i see you smile deep inside i know <eos> im just not over you <eos> im just not over you lie with me my darling <eos> well talk of burning things <eos> the black urgency of the horses eyes <eos> melted in the street <eos> the faint smell of hibiscus <eos> the cracks around your lips <eos> slowly painted over <eos> in some morning before this <eos> my love i stood for days <eos> trying to piece back into place <eos> all the words that fused together <eos> in the fluffy ashen pages <eos> i surrendered every one of them <eos> and the case that couldnt come with them <eos> just to be with you <eos> to be surrounded by your room <eos> with its outline of a fireplace <eos> behind the chair by the fern <eos> talk with me my darling <eos> well lie of burning things <eos> the girl ablaze by the lake <eos> though i could never have seen it <eos> your light breeze from the ceiling fan <eos> and traffic hum downstairs <eos> that thing you do with your left foot <eos> at the edge of the carpet squares <eos> my love i could never sleep <eos> beneath the blankets nor the sheets <eos> beyond the new meridian <eos> scratched into my years <eos> i surrendered every one of them <eos> the long long days the months of green <eos> just to be with you <eos> to be surrounded by your room <eos> with its sunlight on an absent mantle <eos> and the hour ending soon <eos> our hour ending soon cocoa beans flat screens <eos> things that go bang <eos> a thousand singers <eos> neatly in the palm of my hand <eos> allwheel "no deal" <eos> electric n gas <eos> the rain comes down <eos> and then it drips from a tap <eos> all gather around <eos> the vowels and the nouns <eos> the lights and the noise <eos> all the girls all the boys <eos> descended from the apes <eos> woundup to become <eos> clockwork monkeys <eos> each his own little drum <eos> with a head full of wishes <eos> a mouth full of kisses <eos> bright bright spark out <eos> sweet stuff cool stuff <eos> things that go fast <eos> get it real quick <eos> coz its never gonna last <eos> its a good feel feel good <eos> keeping my eyes <eos> one forever forward <eos> and the other behind <eos> your dreams are recurring <eos> that hand that keeps stirring you <eos> moving arousing you <eos> turning you wearing you <eos> down from the apes <eos> woundup to become <eos> clockwork monkeys <eos> each his own little drum <eos> with a head full of wishes <eos> and a mouth full of kisses <eos> see none hear none <eos> speak none too <eos> but its underneath the nails <eos> and it sticks to the shoes <eos> sit down stand up <eos> learn to say "please" <eos> when youre old enough to perish <eos> then well give you the keys <eos> your dreams are beautiful <eos> your rhythm impeccable <eos> marching the hollow men <eos> into the straw <eos> descended from the apes <eos> woundup to become <eos> clockwork monkeys <eos> clanging on their drums <eos> with head full of wishes <eos> wishes full of heading <eos> down from the apes <eos> woundup to become <eos> clockwork monkeys <eos> clinging to their drums <eos> with head full of wishes <eos> wishing and wishing i think the last time that i saw him was <eos> west of the border where the trees are black and <eos> blue is not the colour of the sky <eos> hands buried deep in the pockets of his jeans <eos> and his wild hair was powdered with <eos> our familiar ash <eos> i see his face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror <eos> of every car i drive <eos> and every face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror <eos> reminds me of our last night <eos> i think the last time that i saw him was <eos> out by mccarthys road where the pictures on the trees are all faded and torn <eos> wires in his ears and his shirt of just a year ago <eos> moving in a circle <eos> erecting dust around his shoes <eos> i see his face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror of every car i drive <eos> and every face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror <eos> reminds me of our last night <eos> i think the last time that i saw him was <eos> down by the tracks and the water tower <eos> with its rusted constellations <eos> lips dry and every muscle spidering <eos> a place to catch the sun or climb above one <eos> i see his face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror <eos> of every car i drive <eos> and every face in every corner <eos> of each and every rear vision mirror reminds me of our last night did you feed my cow yes maam <eos> could you tell me how yes maam <eos> what did you feed her corn and hay <eos> what did you feed her corn and hay <eos> did you milk her good yes maam <eos> now did you milk her like you should yes maam <eos> how did you milk her squish squish squish <eos> how did you milk her squish squish squish <eos> did my cow get sick yes maam <eos> was she covered with tick yes maam <eos> how did she die uh uh uh <eos> how did she die uh uh uh <eos> did the buzzards come yes maam <eos> did the buzzards come yes maam <eos> how did they come flop flop flop <eos> how did they come flop flop flop i saw a big dog <eos> i saw a bigger dog <eos> i saw the biggest dog of all bring in the riches <eos> and bring in the goods <eos> give us all eyes <eos> that see what they should <eos> people band together <eos> and for storm in weather beware <eos> all the raging thunder will come <eos> crashing in the air <eos> and the meaning of right <eos> will be well understood <eos> when that old seed of evil <eos> gets washed up good <eos> follow down the line <eos> there is no need <eos> for a break in order <eos> everyone will get their time <eos> then bottom the anchor <eos> unset the sail <eos> people stand ashore <eos> and watch evil get washed some more <eos> and the meaning of right <eos> will be well understood <eos> when that old seed of evil <eos> gets washed up good <eos> and the meaning of right <eos> will be well understood <eos> when that old seed of evil <eos> gets washed up good <eos> george ellias ascap <eos> end co records early one morning <eos> on a cloudy day <eos> everything was gray <eos> people

above the town <eos> echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown <eos> waiting for her master to kiss away her tears <eos> waiting through the years <eos> bitter green they called her walking in the sun <eos> loving everyone that she met <eos> bitter green they called her waiting in the sun <eos> waiting for someone to take her home <eos> some say he was a sailor who died away at sea <eos> some say he was a prisoner who never was set free <eos> lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist <eos> dreaming of a kiss <eos> bitter green they called her walking in the sun <eos> loving everyone that she met <eos> bitter green they called her waiting in the sun <eos> waiting for someone to take her home <eos> but now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust <eos> there comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust <eos> kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist <eos> dreaming of a kiss <eos> bitter green they called her walking in the sun <eos> loving everyone that she met <eos> bitter green they called her waiting in the sun <eos> waiting for someone to take her home <eos> bitter green they called her walking in the sun <eos> loving everyone that she met <eos> bitter green they called her waiting in the sun <eos> waiting for someone <eos> to take her home pickin up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream <eos> i wonder how the old folks are tonight <eos> her name was ann and ill be damned if i recall her face <eos> she left me not knowin what to do <eos> carefree highway let me slip away on you <eos> carefree highway you seen better days <eos> the mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes <eos> carefree highway let me slip away <eos> slip away on you <eos> turnin back the pages to the times i love best <eos> i wonder if shell ever do the same <eos> now the thing that i call livin is just bein satisfied <eos> with knowin i got no one left to blame <eos> carefree highway got ta see you my old flame <eos> carefree highway you seen better days <eos> the mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes <eos> carefree highway let me slip away <eos> slip away on you <eos> searchin through the fragments of my dreamshattered sleep <eos> i wonder if the years have closed her mind <eos> i guess it must be wanderlust or tryin to get free <eos> from the good old faithful feelin we once knew <eos> carefree highway let me slip away on you <eos> carefree highway you seen better days <eos> the mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes <eos> carefree highway let me slip away <eos> slip away on you <eos> let me slip away on you <eos> carefree highway got ta see you my old flame <eos> carefree highway you seen better days <eos> the mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes <eos> carefree highway let me slip away <eos> slip away on you through the woodland through the valley <eos> comes a horseman wild and free <eos> tilting at the windmills passing <eos> who can the brave young horseman be <eos> he is wild but he is mellow <eos> he is strong but he is weak <eos> he is cruel but he is gentle <eos> he is wise but he is meek <eos> reaching for his saddlebag <eos> he takes a battered book into his hand <eos> standing like a prophet bold <eos> he shouts across the ocean to the shore <eos> till he can shout no more <eos> i have come oer moor and mountain <eos> like the hawk upon the wing <eos> i was once a shining knight <eos> who was the guardian of a king <eos> i have searched the whole world over <eos> looking for a place to sleep <eos> i have seen the strong survive <eos> and i have seen the lean grown weak <eos> see the children of the earth <eos> who wake to find the table bare <eos> see the gentry in the country <eos> riding off to take the air <eos> reaching for his saddlebag <eos> he takes a rusty sword into his hand <eos> then striking up a knightly pose <eos> he shouts across the ocean to the shore <eos> till he can shout no more <eos> see the jailor with his key <eos> who locks away all trace of sin <eos> see the judge upon the bench <eos> who tries the case as best he can <eos> see the wise and wicked ones <eos> who feed upon lifes sacred fire <eos> see the soldier with his gun <eos> who must be dead to be admired <eos> see the man who tips the needle <eos> see the man who buys and sells <eos> see the man who puts the collar <eos> on the ones who dare not tell <eos> see the drunkard in the tavern <eos> stemming gold to make ends meet <eos> see the youth in ghetto black <eos> condemned to life upon the street <eos> reaching for his saddlebag <eos> he takes a tarnished cross into his hand <eos> then standing like a preacher now <eos> he shouts across the ocean to the shore <eos> then in a blaze of tangled hooves <eos> he gallops off across the dusty plain <eos> in vain to search again <eos> where no one will hear <eos> through the woodland through the valley <eos> comes a horseman wild and free <eos> tilting at the windmills passing <eos> who can the brave young horseman be <eos> he is wild but he is mellow <eos> he is strong but he is weak <eos> he is cruel but he is gentle <eos> he is wise but he is meek at times i just dont know <eos> how you could be anything but beautiful <eos> i think that i was made for you <eos> and you were made for me <eos> and i know that i wont ever change <eos> weve been friends through rain or shine <eos> for such a long long time <eos> laughing eyes and smiling face <eos> it seems so lucky just to have the right <eos> of telling you with all my might <eos> youre beautiful tonight <eos> and i know that you wont ever stray <eos> cause youve been that way from day to day <eos> for such a long long time <eos> and when you hold me tight <eos> how could life be anything but beautiful <eos> i think that i was made for you <eos> and you were made for me <eos> and i know that i wont ever change <eos> weve been friends through rain or shine <eos> for such a long long time <eos> well i must say it means so much to me <eos> to be the one whos telling you <eos> im telling you that youre beautiful theres a house on a hill <eos> by a worn down weathered old mill <eos> in the valley below where the river winds <eos> theres no such thing as bad times <eos> and a soft southern flame <eos> oh cotton jennys her name <eos> she wakes me up when the sun goes down <eos> and the wheels of love go round <eos> wheels of love go round <eos> love go round love go round <eos> a joyful sound <eos> i aint got a penny for cotton jenny to spend <eos> but then the wheels go round <eos> when the new day begins <eos> i go down to the cotton gin <eos> and i make my time worth while to them <eos> then i climb back up again <eos> and she waits by the door <eos> oh cotton jenny im sore <eos> and she rubs my feet while the sun goes down <eos> and the wheels of love go round <eos> wheels of love go round <eos> love go round love go round <eos> a joyful sound <eos> i aint got a penny for cotton jenny to spend <eos> but then

so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day <eos> and talk about the home town a million miles away <eos> is the ice still on the river are the old folks still the same <eos> and by the way did she mention my name <eos> did she mention my name just in passing <eos> and when the morning came <eos> do you remember if she dropped a name or two <eos> is the home team still on fire do they still win all the games <eos> and by the way did she mention my name <eos> did she mention my name just in passing <eos> and when the talk ran high <eos> did the look in her eye seem far away <eos> wont you say hello from someone theyll be no need to explain <eos> and by the way did she mention my name there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run <eos> when the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun <eos> long before the white man and long before the wheel <eos> when the green dark forest was too silent to be real <eos> but time has no beginnings and histry has no bounds <eos> as to this verdant country they came from all around <eos> they sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall <eos> built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all <eos> and when the young mans fancy was turnin to the spring <eos> the railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring <eos> their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day <eos> and many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay <eos> for they looked in the future and what did they see <eos> they saw an iron road runnin from sea to the sea <eos> bringin the goods to a young growin land <eos> all up through the seaports and into their hands <eos> look away said they across this mighty land <eos> from the eastern shore to the western strand <eos> bring in the workers and bring up the rails <eos> we gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails <eos> open er heart let the life blood flow <eos> gotta get on our way cause were movin too slow <eos> bring in the workers and bring up the rails <eos> were gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails <eos> open er heart let the life blood flow <eos> gotta get on our way cause were movin too slow <eos> get on our way cause were movin too slow <eos> behind the blue rockies the sun is declinin <eos> the stars they come stealin at the close of the day <eos> across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping <eos> beyond the dark oceans in a place far away <eos> we are the navvies who work upon the railway <eos> swingin our hammers in the bright blazin sun <eos> livin on stew and drinkin bad whiskey <eos> bendin our old backs til the long days are done <eos> we are the navvies who work upon the railway <eos> swingin our hammers in the bright blazin sun <eos> layin down track and buildin the bridges <eos> bendin our old backs til the railroad is done <eos> so over the mountains and over the plains <eos> into the muskeg and into the rain <eos> up the st lawrence all the way to gaspe <eos> swingin our hammers and drawin our pay <eos> drivin em in and tyin em down <eos> away to the bunkhouse and into the town <eos> a dollar a day and a place for my head <eos> a drink to the livin and a toast to the dead <eos> oh the song of the future has been sung <eos> all the battles have been won <eos> oer the mountain tops we stand <eos> all the world at our command <eos> we have opened up the soil <eos> with our teardrops and our toil <eos> for there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run <eos> when the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun <eos> long before the white man and long before the wheel <eos> when the green dark forest was too silent to be real <eos> when the green dark forest was too silent to be real <eos> and many are the dead men too silent to be real rows of lights in a circle of steel <eos> where you place your bets on a great big wheel <eos> high windows flickerin down through the snow <eos> a time you know <eos> sights and sounds of the people goin round <eos> everybodys in step with the season <eos> a child is born to a welfare case <eos> where the rats run around like they own the place <eos> the room is chilly the building is old <eos> thats how it goes <eos> the doctors found on his welfare round <eos> and he comes and he leaves on the double <eos> deck the halls was the song they played <eos> in the flat next door where they shout all day <eos> she tips her gin bottle back till its gone <eos> the child is strong <eos> a week a day they will take it away <eos> for they know about all her bad habits <eos> christmas dawns and the snow lets up <eos> and the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup <eos> she hides her face in her hands for a while <eos> says look here child <eos> your fathers pride

<eos> and the drizzle turned to snow <eos> his eyes were red his hopes were dead <eos> and the wine was runnin low <eos> and the old man came home <eos> from the forest <eos> his tears fell on the sidewalk <eos> as he stumbled in the street <eos> a dozen faces stopped to stare <eos> but no one stopped to speak <eos> for his castle was a hallway <eos> and the bottle was his friend <eos> and the old man stumbled in <eos> from the forest <eos> up a dark and dingy staircase <eos> the old man made his way <eos> his ragged coat around him <eos> as upon his cot he lay <eos> and he wondered how it happened <eos> that he ended up this way <eos> getting lost like a fool <eos> in the forest <eos> and as he lay there sleeping <eos> a vision did appear <eos> upon his mantle shining <eos> a face of one so dear <eos> who had loved him in the springtime <eos> of a longforgotten year <eos> when the wildflowers did bloom <eos> in the forest <eos> she touched his grizzled fingers <eos> and she called him by his name <eos> and then he heard the joyful sound <eos> of children at their games <eos> in an old house on a hillside <eos> in some forgotten town <eos> where the river runs down <eos> from the forest <eos> with a mighty roar the big jets soar <eos> above the canyon streets <eos> and the con men con but life goes on <eos> for the city never sleeps <eos> and to an old forgotten soldier <eos> the dawn will come no more <eos> for the old man has come home <eos> from the forest hey you upon this ship of fools <eos> i have found you bending your own rules <eos> thank you i dont mind if

the wind to change with one wave of my hand <eos> and if i could play the final symphony and set it free <eos> would it mean anything to you <eos> if i could stand like a rusty old man in his armor <eos> if i could ride the steed that he rode in his time <eos> i would turn his head away to the river <eos> and let him wander through the meadow grass wild and free <eos> for everyone to see a one man band on a one night stand <eos> as a one man band should be <eos> the cried for more he replied why sure <eos> and he played one just for free <eos> the sounds he laid down the songs he played

a busy day <eos> and a tiny wisp of smoke is arisin <eos> "oh lord" she groans "im burning <eos> let someone understand" <eos> but her silent plea is wasted <eos> in the playin of the band <eos> everybodys dancin on her deck <eos> and theyre havin such a time <eos> and a voice says "shut up and deal im losin" <eos> deep within the yarmouth castle <eos> the fire begins to glow <eos> it leaps into the hallways <eos> and climbs and twists and grows <eos> and the paint she wore to keep her young <eos> oh lord how well it burns <eos> and soon that old fire is aragin <eos> up beneath the bridge its climbin fast <eos> the captain stands aloft <eos> he calls up to the boatswain says <eos> "boatswain we are lost" <eos> for the ragged hoses in the racks <eos> no pressure do they hold <eos> and the people down below will soon be dyin <eos> all amidships oh shes blazin now <eos> its spreadin fore and aft <eos> the people are ascramblin <eos> as the fire blocks their path <eos> the evil smoke surrounds them <eos> and theyre fallin in their tracks <eos> and the captain in his lifeboat is aleavin <eos> oh then the ship bahama star <eos> comes steamin through the night <eos> she sees the castle blazin <eos> and tis a terrible sight <eos> "jump down jump down" the captain cries <eos> "well save you if we can" <eos> then the paint on his funnels is afryin <eos> "god help the ones who sleep below <eos> and cannot find the way <eos> thank god for those we rescue <eos> upon this awful day" <eos> now the heroes they are many <eos> but the times are growin slim <eos> and now from stern to bow shes ablazin <eos> oh the yarmouth castles moanin <eos> shes cryin like a child <eos> you can hear her if you listen <eos> above the roar so wild <eos> is she cryin for the ones who lie <eos> within her molten sides <eos> or cryin for herself im awonderin <eos> but the livin soon were rescued <eos> the ones who lived to tell <eos> from the star they watched her <eos> as she died there in the swells <eos> like a toy ship on a mill pond <eos> she burned all through the night <eos> then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin in the early mornin rain <eos> with a dollar in my hand <eos> with an aching in my heart <eos> and my pockets full of sand <eos> im a long ways from home <eos> and i missed my loved one so <eos> in the early mornin rain <eos> with no place to go <eos> out on runway number nine <eos> big seven o seven set to go <eos> well im stuck here on the grass <eos> where the pavement never grows <eos> where the liquor tasted good <eos> and all the women all were fast <eos> there there she goes my friend <eos> shes rolling down at last <eos> hear the mighty engines roar <eos> see the silver wing on high <eos> shes away and westward bound <eos> for above the clouds shell fly <eos> where the mornin rain dont fall <eos> and the sun always shines <eos> shell be flying over my home <eos> in about three hours time <eos> this ol airports got me down <eos> its no damn good to me <eos> and im stuck here on the ground <eos> as cold and drunk as i can be <eos> cant jump a jet plane <eos> like you can a freight train <eos> so i best be on my way <eos> in the early mornin rain <eos> cant jump a jet plane <eos> like you can a freight train <eos> so i best be on my way <eos> in the early mornin rain in this land of chance do we know right from wrong <eos> even at a glance we know the road is long <eos> we dont owe a single thing to anyone <eos> most of us do not believe in come what may <eos> everything we fought for was in vain they say <eos> even when called upon to throw our lives away <eos> we have been captured by the thieves of the night <eos> held for ransom if you please <eos> heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories <eos> in these times of trial and uncertainty <eos> i have thought what does this freedom mean to me <eos> is it just some long forgotten fantasy <eos> our love for each other may not be explained <eos> we live in a world where tears must fall like rain <eos> most of us dont wish to cause each other pain <eos> we have been captured by the thieves of the night <eos> held for ransom if you please <eos> heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories <eos> to every unsung hero in the universe <eos> to those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth <eos> to all good men of reason may they never thirst <eos> we have wings to guide us through the timeless sea <eos> and faith that will remain through all eternity <eos> we try to be helpful to the ones in need <eos> we have been captured by the thieves of the night <eos> held for ransom if you please <eos> heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories all i can see is the sea and the sky <eos> and the sky is blue and the sea is green <eos> yesterdays a cabaret <eos> gowns of satin on ladies gay <eos> yesterdays a cabaret <eos> sounds of laughter on faces gray <eos> yesterdays a carousel <eos> catch the ring and all will be well <eos> from the coast of california <eos> up to the oregon border <eos> ive thumbed a thousand miles i guess <eos> sitting in a roadside diner <eos> the big trucks rollin by <eos> i dont seem to know at times whats best <eos> and still id like to tell her <eos> that i miss her so in north ontario <eos> if youre drivin east to reno <eos> or north to mendocino <eos> i hope you find your rainbows end <eos> this highway is my rainbow <eos> and though i might regret it <eos> im so glad i said it way back when <eos> and still id like to tell her <eos> that i miss her so in north ontario when i walk the hill so high <eos> around the town where i was born <eos> new york seems so far away <eos> though i was there just yesterday <eos> i have played on my guitar <eos> in coffeehouses hall and bars <eos> everyone that i call friend <eos> knows they will not be forgot <eos> trains and planes and rented cars <eos> singers saints and other starts <eos> i suspect them every one <eos> theyll never change its too much fun <eos> just for now id like to rest <eos> in the shade of a maple tree <eos> to the blue canadian sky <eos> ill say a prayer for the world out there <eos> when i stand on my own sod <eos> it feels so good to be home by god <eos> the winter wind has turned my head <eos> but i always came up warm somehow <eos> bottles beads and cigarettes <eos> and lovers that i aint found yet <eos> pickin with a friend till dawn <eos> and singing all of those hiway songs <eos> just for now id like to rest <eos> in the shade of a maple tree <eos> to the blue canadian sky <eos> ill say a prayer for the world out there <eos> when i walk the hill so high <eos> around the town where i was born <eos> new york seems so far away <eos> though i was there just yesterday <eos> i would travel all my life <eos> if loneliness was not the price <eos> while headin north across that lines <eos> the only time im flyin oh when he was a man my father would stand <eos> i never saw him run <eos> there wasnt anyone could make the man bend <eos> the strength of his will was the tool of his trade <eos> and he did his work well <eos> till the powers that be took a liking to him <eos> and they traded his body for a cold empty shell <eos> dont beat me down <eos> dont beat me down <eos> ive got something to say <eos> dont you stand in my way <eos> and dont beat me down <eos> oh when i was a youth i found the truth <eos> in the eyes of a friend <eos> there wasnt anyone could make the light dim <eos> and we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win <eos> and the learning was good <eos> till the powers that be to a liking to him <eos> they traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood <eos> when i was a child and my mother smiled <eos> at the cradle she bought <eos> for the little tot she held to her breast <eos> and the song that she sang was an anthem to love <eos> it was all that i heard <eos> till the powers that be took a liking to me <eos> and they told me that love was a fourletter word <eos> dont beat me down <eos> dont beat me down <eos> ive got one life to live <eos> and thats all i can give <eos> so dont beat me down <eos> and now ive got a place i got a worried face <eos> and a question in mind <eos> please let me find a reason somehow <eos> why some reap the harvest while other men die <eos> and the joker runs wild <eos> and if powers that be take a liking to us <eos> then we all must return to the ways of a child <eos> we all must return to the ways of a child <eos> so dont beat me down <eos> dont beat me down <eos> ive got something to say <eos> dont you stand in my way <eos> and dont beat me down <eos> ive got one life to life <eos> and thats all i can give <eos> so dont beat me down <eos> dont beat me down <eos> dont beat me down i see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight <eos> the hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write <eos> but songs of love will never leave loves feelings undefiled <eos> the tide has turned the waves roll in the waters fill my eyes <eos> the price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand <eos> the tears i shed were not in shame the world was in my hands <eos> if trust was just a simple thing then trusting i would be <eos> but deep within my soul i know its better to be free <eos> the days fly by the waves roll in but freedom has not come <eos> i fear my faith will soon give out my senses come undone <eos> my role is played the demon dogs come stealin oer land <eos> and foolish i would climb once more a tree too weak to stand <eos> i see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight <eos> the hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write <eos> but songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned <eos> and foolish i would climb once more a tree too weak to stand <eos> and foolish i would climb once more a tree too weak to stand island goodbye island goodbye <eos> we been too long together my

annabel farewell <eos> farewell to annabel farewell <eos> farewell to annabel fare thee well <eos> farewell to annabel farewell i came down through albany to new york <eos> to find what id been missin <eos> i looked across the river to the city <eos> where the windows all stood glistenin <eos> i stood listenin <eos> into a tunnel i did rise like a grave inside <eos> but i was young and able <eos> when i came out the other end <eos> ah through the smoke the winter light was feeble <eos> unreadable <eos> i was optimistic though a cabbie told me where to go <eos> i thanked him <eos> a face of white a face of brown <eos> ah here a smile and there a look of danger <eos> for a stranger <eos> it was too unreal for me <eos> i found no one who trusted me <eos> there was no man could offer me <eos> a cold hand from new york <eos> cold hands from new york <eos> a voice within you cries "wont someone please help me <eos> ill do the same for you one day <eos> if you should ever pass my way and need me" <eos> i came down to live alone in new york <eos> the city of the living <eos> there were fortunes at my feet but most of men <eos> were taking none we giving <eos> or forgiving <eos> children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways <eos> i saw them <eos> there were men who lived in style and others who had died <eos> where no one knew them <eos> beause they couldnt win <eos> there were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms <eos> where babies crept unwanted <eos> till i began to ask myself if there were hope <eos> or if it mattered what they did <eos> or if they lived <eos> it was too unreal for me <eos> i found no one who trusted me <eos> there was no man could offer me <eos> a cold hand from new york <eos> cold hands from new york <eos> a voice within you cries "wont someone please help me <eos> ill do the same for you one day <eos> if you should ever pass my way and need me" <eos> i came down through albany to new york <eos> to find what id been missin <eos> i looked across the river to the city <eos> where the windows all stood glistenin <eos> i stood listenin <eos> and there were prophets in the squares <eos> and people there who smiled and said "forget it" <eos> there were lovers in the park <eos> and there was danger in the dark i felt it <eos> so afraid of it <eos> and there were preachers of the word and poets <eos> who were never heard i heard them <eos> there were those who would not try to learn <eos> the measure of the lie theyre livin <eos> i heard a young musician play in a place <eos> where they paid you not to listen <eos> i heard a woman scream for help while men stood by <eos> and offered their best wishes <eos> thats how it is <eos> it was too unreal for me <eos> i found no one who trusted me <eos> there was no man could offer me <eos> a cold hand from new york <eos> cold hands from new york <eos> a voice within you cries "wont someone please help me <eos> ill do the same for you one day <eos> if you should ever pass my way and need me" <eos> cold hands from new york <eos> a voice within you cries "wont someone please help me <eos> ill do the same for you one day <eos> if you should ever pass my way and need me" <eos> cold hands from new york <eos> a voice within you cries "wont someone please help me <eos> ill do the same for you one day <eos> if you should ever pass my way and need me" i aint got

someday when your poor heart <eos> is on the mend <eos> i just might pass this way again the perfume that she wore was from some little store <eos> on the down side of town <eos> but it lingered on long after shed gone <eos> i remember it well <eos> and our fingers entwined like ribbons of light <eos> and we came through a doorway somewhere in the night <eos> her long flowing hair came softly undone <eos> and it lay all around <eos> and she brushed it down as i stood by her side <eos> in the warmth of her love <eos> and she showed me her treasures of paper and tin <eos> and we played a game only she could win <eos> and she told me a riddle ill never forget <eos> then left with the answer ive never found yet <eos> "how long" said she "can a moment like this <eos> belong to someone" <eos> "whats wrong what is right when to live or to die <eos> we must almost be born" <eos> so if you should ask me what secrets i hide <eos> im only your lover dont make me decide <eos> the perfume that she wore was from some little store <eos> on the down side of town <eos> but it lingered on long after shed gone <eos> i remember it well <eos> and she showed me her treasures of paper and tin <eos> and we played a game only she could win <eos> and our fingers entwined like ribbons of light <eos> and we came through a doorway somewhere in the night any way the wind may blow <eos> any way

moon <eos> that shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon <eos> and i need to be there when the autumn wind goes <eos> singing through the trestle we would climb <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> born in the country and i like that country song <eos> we played for just a nickel every time we got to town <eos> and i bought you a dime diamond ring <eos> in the hayloft we would play we were princesses and kings <eos> and i need to be there when the world <eos> gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> born in the country and i like that country way <eos> of the uncles aunts and cousins and the card games they would play <eos> while the young ones slept overhead <eos> beneath the quilts that mother made when all the prayers were said <eos> and i need to be there when the autumn wind <eos> goes singing through the trestle we would climb <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> and i need to be there when the world <eos> gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time is it my imagination or is it my iron pride <eos> i wonder if it matters much if time is on my side <eos> id rather press on i dont wanta rest easy <eos> anywhere i stray i will make it a brand new day <eos> anyway that is all ive gotta say <eos> id rather be by the seaside <eos> than be playing a one night stand <eos> ive been too wrapped up in my own dreams <eos> i will change things if i can <eos> i gotta press on dont wanta rest easy <eos> wouldnt it feel fine to return to the women and the wine <eos> and all of the sunshine that we knew <eos> you will never know what blue is <eos> until you have played the game <eos> till you live life in solitaire where <eos> no one knows your name <eos> id rather press on i dont want to rest easy <eos> have it anyway you will <eos> i will be with you right up until <eos> the spell is broken and all is well <eos> if youd rather be by the seashore <eos> well i sure can understand <eos> are you too wrapped up in your own scene <eos> i would change things if i can <eos> id rather press on dont want to rest easy <eos> wouldnt it feel fine <eos> but remembering the rhythm and the rhymes <eos> and all of the good times makes me blue <eos> wouldnt it feel fine to return to the women and the wine <eos> and all of the sunshine that we knew id like to be in biscuit city <eos> with my banjo in my hand <eos> i dont need no long vacation <eos> in some foreign land <eos> cause the sound of my own breathing <eos> has been turning to a sigh <eos> i wish that i could make the time <eos> to be in biscuit city by and by <eos> oh the water is of emerald <eos> and the beach is white as snow <eos> and everyones got money <eos> and no place to go <eos> in a land of milk and honey <eos> it can really make you smile <eos> and if i had a ticket <eos> i would stay in biscuit city for a while <eos> all the girls are in bikinis <eos> all the boys are in the buff <eos> with the baby in between and <eos> that makes three of us <eos> and the streets are all so quiet <eos> and the walls are squeaky clean <eos> i think you aint been nowhere til <eos> the town of biscuit city you have seen <eos> id rather be in biscuit city <eos> with my banjo in my hand <eos> than take a big vacation <eos> in some foreign land <eos> cause the sound of my own breathing <eos> has been turning to a sigh <eos> if it were not for misfortune <eos> i would be in biscuit city by and by <eos> if it were not for misfortune <eos> i would stay in biscuit city til i die sit by my side come as close as the air <eos> sharin a memory of grey <eos> and wander in my words <eos> and dream about the pictures that i play <eos> of changes <eos> green leaves of summer turn red in the fall <eos> to brown and to yellow they fade <eos> and then they have to die <eos> trapped within the circle time parade <eos> of changes <eos> moments of magic will glow in the night <eos> all fears of the forest are gone <eos> for when the morning breaks <eos> theyre swept away by golden drops of dawn <eos> of changes <eos> passions will part to a warm melody <eos> as fires will sometimes turn cold <eos> like petals in the wind <eos> were puppets to the silver strings of souls <eos> of changes oh the prairie lights are burnin bright <eos> the chinook wind is amovin in <eos> tomorrow night ill be alberta bound <eos> though ive done the best i could <eos> my old luck aint been so good and <eos> tomorrow night ill be alberta bound <eos> no oneeyed man could eer forget <eos> the rocky mountain sunset <eos> its a pleasure just to be alberta bound <eos> i long to see my next of kin <eos> to know what kind of shape theyre in <eos> tomorrow night ill be alberta bound <eos> alberta bound alberta bound <eos> its good to be alberta bound <eos> alberta bound alberta bound <eos> its good to be alberta bound <eos> oh the skyline of toronto <eos> is somethin youll get onto <eos> but they say youve got to live there for a while <eos> and if you got the money <eos> you can get yourself a honey <eos> a written guarantee ta make you smile <eos> but its snowin in the city <eos> and the streets and brown and gritty <eos> and i know theres pretty girls all over town <eos> but they never seem ta find me <eos> and the one i left behind me <eos> is the reason that ill be alberta bound <eos> alberta bound alberta bound <eos> its good to be alberta bound <eos> alberta bound alberta bound <eos> its good to be alberta bound <eos> its good to be alberta bound i was at the break wall i was lookin at the sea <eos> in back of the eight ball in some misery <eos> there on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools <eos> they were headin into the harbor with all their broken rules <eos> whenever im feelin lonely i can just pick up the phone <eos> or i can go to the movies or just stay at home alone <eos> theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long way from home <eos> any way i can lose myself <eos> dawn is breakin im hesitatin <eos> im fading away fading away <eos> they sailed right up to me i said "whats it all about <eos> please try to excuse me we can work things out <eos> if youve ever wondered if that mighty ship is real <eos> let me tell ya bout it brother it was somethin you could feel" <eos> whenever im feelin lonely i let twilight set the tone <eos> or i can go to the movies or just stay at home alone <eos> theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long way to roam <eos> aint livin high on the hog right now <eos> dawn is breakin im hesitatin <eos> im fading away fading away <eos> one more day on the calendar in my mind <eos> i am down at the break wall puttin in some time <eos> the whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way <eos> and i was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say <eos> whenever im feelin lonely i can just pick up the phone <eos> or i can go to the movies or just stay at home alone <eos> theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long piece from home <eos> any way i can lose myself <eos> dawn is breakin im hesitatin <eos> im fading away fading away <eos> fading away fading away i remember everything <eos> ive learned about survival <eos> ive walked with fools and kings <eos> and ive even read the bible <eos> there i came upon some lines <eos> givin me direction <eos> gather not your gold on earth <eos> your kingdom is in heaven <eos> but i chose to live instead <eos> inside the shell they gave me <eos> til in spite of everything <eos> good fortune came to find me <eos> i tried my best to run away <eos> but i could not avoid the feelin <eos> soon i was reelin on my feet <eos> i made a grab at anything <eos> the earth was gone and i was on <eos> a vicious circle then <eos> after id gone and let myself surrender <eos> i didnt want to die at all <eos> i thought id live forever <eos> then she gave me everything <eos> a king could never borrow <eos> but i twisted all her gifts <eos> her wisdom was my sorrow <eos> so i left her cryin <eos> and roamed across the river <eos> the angels offered me their hands <eos> but i could not forget her <eos> so i came to where she was <eos> by river road and reason <eos> i slept beneath her window <eos> in the moonlight summer season <eos> but i could not go inside <eos> i heard the sound of laughter <eos> and the rustle of her hair upon his skin <eos> i made a grab at anything <eos> the earth was gone and i was on <eos> a vicious circle then <eos> after id gone to cry down my sorrow <eos> i didnt want to live no more <eos> nor face the bright tomorrow <eos> then i remembered everything <eos> ive learned about survival <eos> havin walked with fools and kings <eos> ive even read the bible <eos> i remember all those lines <eos> givin me direction <eos> gather not your gold on earth <eos> it will not pass inspection <eos> and still i think when im alone <eos> away from all night splendor <eos> if gold could buy one night with her <eos> i wish i had some to send her im not afraid that when im dying <eos> therell be no one to hold my hand <eos> if theres a god up there he loves me <eos> as much as my old woman can <eos> i dont intend to be a martyr <eos> i dont give a damn what people say <eos> and if i never get to heaven <eos> heaven dont deserve me anyway <eos> ive tasted life both good and evil <eos> at times i was cruel and did not pay <eos> and if i never get to heaven <eos> heaven dont deserve me anyway <eos> i dont know what it was i came for <eos> but ive enjoyed it up til now <eos> if theres a friend who ever needs me <eos> ill do my best to help somehow <eos> i dont intend to keep no secrets <eos> i dont give a damn what people say <eos> and if i never get to heaven <eos> heaven dont deserve me anyway <eos> i know and ill admit my failures <eos> i dont give a damn what people say <eos> and if i never get to heaven <eos> heaven dont deserve me anyway <eos> and if i never get to heaven <eos> heaven dont deserve me anyway does your mother know <eos> you had to go someday <eos> does your mother know <eos> that you would go so fast <eos> anyway thats all you think about <eos> youd call her if you could <eos> but the letters that you write <eos> in the faded winter light <eos> just tell her they tell her <eos> that youve got ten dollars <eos> and youll be all right <eos> and when you get straight <eos> youre gonna come back east some day <eos> does your mother know <eos> you have a man in the west <eos> does your mother know <eos> you drove him from your door <eos> anyway thats all you think about <eos> youd call her if you could <eos> does your mother know <eos> you walked all day in the rain <eos> does your mother know <eos> how deep your love could be <eos> anyway thats all you think about <eos> youd call her if you could <eos> but the letters that you write <eos> in the faded winter light <eos> just tell her they tell her <eos> that youve got ten dollars <eos> and your rent costs eight <eos> and when you get straight <eos> youre gonna come back east some day <eos> but the letters that you write <eos> in the faded winter light <eos> just tell her they tell her its so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day <eos> and talk about the home town a million miles away <eos> is the ice still on the river are the old folks still the same <eos> and by the way did she mention my name <eos> did she mention my name just in passing <eos> and when the morning came do you remember if she dropped a name or two <eos> is the home team still on fire do they still win all the games <eos> and by the way did she mention my name <eos> is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang in the hall <eos> are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall <eos> does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame <eos> and by the way did she mention my name <eos> did she mention my name just in passing <eos> and when the talk ran high did the look in her eye seem far away <eos> is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain <eos> and by the way did she mention my name i saw a moonlit scene i never will forget <eos> i stole a kiss at daybreak i never did regret it <eos> sometimes i wonder why i even try <eos> so why should i feel blue <eos> i heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark <eos> i poked my head out silent thats how it started <eos> what to my eyes appeared as dust <eos> became a vision i dont know <eos> what had finally found me with my back against the wall <eos> was destiny intruding all around me <eos> and as the day wore on i knew <eos> another lonely night could never be <eos> if theres is a reason you might try and forget <eos> id like to find it cause i like to relive it <eos> sometimes i wonder why i ever cry <eos> so why should i feel blue <eos> i was caught drifting disappearing from the land <eos> whitecaps in profusion all around me <eos> but somehow in our eyes i found the strength <eos> to sail upon the raging sea <eos> if theres a reason for the way that life is <eos> id like to find it after all whos life is it <eos> sometimes i wonder why i even try <eos> so why should i feel blue <eos> what had finally found me with my back against the wall <eos> was destiny intruding all around me <eos> and as the days wore on i knew <eos> another lonely night with you could never be <eos> i saw a moonlit scene i know it was real <eos> all that you can ever do when love is reveal <eos> sometimes i every try why i even try <eos> so why should i feel blue <eos> sometimes i wonder why i ever cry <eos> so why should i feel blue i think

the band was grooving <eos> when he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her <eos> how was she to know at the time he would mistreat her <eos> in her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way <eos> and before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one <eos> only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care <eos> only twentyone she was a young girl just in from somewhere <eos> hes playing up in michigan with a group they call the intended <eos> with a kiss and a promise he was gone the song was ended <eos> but as she walks she waits for him the pavement is a shoulder for her tears <eos> but in her heart she knows there is no way she can hope to change him <eos> only a gogo girl in love with someone who didnt care <eos> only

to do what never was done <eos> i was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone <eos> come right or wrong it was laid to rest that way <eos> i hate to be unkind pretending is for strangers who dont know you <eos> i spent most of my life outside in the driving rain <eos> i was in some onehorse town just waiting for a plane <eos> to take me back now wheres that at i paid the

boys they remind me of a child <eos> that i knew and a big harvest moon <eos> that shon by suppertime in the dusty afternoon <eos> and i need to be there <eos> when the autumn wind goes whistlin through the trestle we would climb <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> born in the country and i like that country song <eos> we played for just a nickel every time we got to town <eos> and i bought you a dime diamond ring <eos> in the hayloft we would play we were princesses and kings <eos> and i need to be there <eos> when the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> born in the country and i like that country way <eos> of the uncles and the cousins and the card games they would play <eos> while the young ones slept overhead <eos> beneath the quilts that mother made when all the prayers were said <eos> and i need to be there <eos> when the autumn wind goes whistlin through the trestle we would climb <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time <eos> and i need to be there <eos> when the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind <eos> like brave mountaineers <eos> we never were much bothered by time down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay <eos> ive been on my own for so long as i stand here today <eos> id never leave you ill do anything that you say <eos> ive been around some walking on the down the street <eos> feeling as low as the shoes on the soles of my feet <eos> taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say <eos> playing guitar doesnt make you a star anyway <eos> manys the time ive wished that i were free <eos> but my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see <eos> id never leave you ill do anything that you say <eos> whenever the thought seems better off left alone <eos> i think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong <eos> taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say <eos> playing guitar doesnt make you a star anyway betty jo you made it plain <eos> when first you held me near <eos> even though you caused me pain <eos> you were all the world to me <eos> we made love we had such fun <eos> many fine times went by us <eos> now its all so hazy and a little bit crazy <eos> betty jo my hearts on fire i dont need this crying <eos> the next time you see me <eos> in the back seat of a taxis where ill be <eos> betty called me in to say goodnight <eos> much to my relief and pure delight <eos> i think that was my big love scene <eos> i do believe her engine run all right <eos> betty said get ready the time has come <eos> i was young and my good life had begun <eos> and with the dawn the child in me was gone <eos> betty made a man out of me that night <eos> betty made my clothes and sewed my jeans <eos> listening to my songs and foolish schemes <eos> i think the way she got to me <eos> it would seem like a laser beam right to the soul <eos> betty my true love do what you do tonight <eos> where she goes i hope she knows shes right <eos> the worst of times and the best of times <eos> she was never the kind to kick and bitch and fight <eos> betty called me in to say goodnight <eos> much to my relief and pure delight <eos> and with the dawn the child in me was gone <eos> betty made a man out of me that night <eos> i think that was my big love scene <eos> i do believe her engine run all right a passing ship <eos> i have found the open ocean <eos> give me no lip <eos> the waves roll by as i pass on <eos> a sunlit sea <eos> on the first day of april <eos> how fresh the wind <eos> will you miss me when im gone <eos> how many words <eos> how many songs still unwritten <eos> how many ships <eos> of the line have come and gone <eos> in the good old days <eos> may they never be forgotten <eos> they had heavy wind <eos> or they had no wind at all <eos> a passing ship <eos> it is midnight on the ocean <eos> had a real long trip <eos> i have been at sea all winter <eos> when my ship came in <eos> i was givin up the ghost <eos> i think i should be <eos> leavin those passing ships alone <eos> when the sea runs high <eos> the sea runs wild and im unsteady <eos> and i think of you <eos> in the warmth of your home and family <eos> when love is true <eos> there is no truer occupation <eos> and may this gale <eos> blow us to the ones we love <eos> another day another ocean <eos> give me no lip <eos> but stand aside as i pass on <eos> a sunlit sea <eos> on the last day in october <eos> how fresh the wind <eos> will you miss me from now on <eos> i guess i should be <eos> leavin passing ships alone i want to hear it from you <eos> i want to hear it from someone who knows how it is <eos> all the secondhand words seem to get in my way <eos> i want to hear it from you <eos> i want to hear it again <eos> i want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips <eos> must be taken away like a mothers first kiss to the life that she gives <eos> ive got a right to get it straight from you <eos> to give my life a different point of view <eos> to find a way to keep from losing you <eos> if you dont know what to say <eos> to understand is my life and the question is why <eos> you should cry in the night while your eyes look away <eos> every time that i speak and theres nothing to say <eos> i want to hear it from you <eos> i want to hear it from you <eos> let me know how you feel <eos> youve got to make up your mind <eos> tell me where i can run <eos> when my roof tumbles in <eos> i want to hear it from you <eos> i want

bound <eos> on that southern sea <eos> to sea what ecstasy was worth when first i did appear upon this native soil <eos> all up and down this country at labor i did toil <eos> i slumbered in the moonlight and i rose with the sun <eos> i rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run <eos> when first i did come down where the land meets the sea <eos> the people said who are you and what would your name be <eos> i said i have no home and i am no mans son <eos> twas inland i was born and from inland that i come <eos> in the good land i was young and i was strong <eos> no one dared to call me son <eos> happy just to see my days work done <eos> see my days work done <eos> so i swung an axe as a timberjack <eos> and i worked the quebec mines <eos> and on the golden prairie i rode the big combines <eos> i sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town <eos> built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds <eos> ive gazed upon the good times ive seen the bad times too <eos> felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin dew <eos> ive watched the country growin like a fair and mighty thing <eos> and on the still of a summer night ive heard the mountains ring <eos> in the good land i was young and i was strong <eos> no one dared to call me son <eos> happy just to see my days work done <eos> see my days work done <eos> but now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide <eos> the old ways are forgotten theres no place left to hide <eos> and the legacy im leavin you is not very hard to find <eos> youll see it all around you at this crossroads of time <eos> in the sweet soil its agrowin at the crossroads of time youve been in all my dreams since youve been gone <eos> each mornin that i wake up with the dawn <eos> dream street rose i like the way you smile <eos> dream street rose stay with me a while <eos> you gave more than anyone could ask <eos> you washed away all shadows from my past <eos> dream street rose heaven only knows <eos>

trade in the white mans place <eos> it was early in the spring when the snow had disappeared <eos> they came down with a bag of skins <eos> in the fall of the year of <eos> daddy died by the rope down in cherokee bend <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man said <eos> bout the dirty little kid at his side <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man did <eos> nor the deal or the way that he lied <eos> there was blood on the floor of the government store <eos> when the men took his daddy away <eos> but the boy stayed back till he come to his end <eos> and he run like the wind from cherokee bend <eos> now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand <eos> and she prayed to her spirit kin <eos> it was warm in the lodge in the kentucky hills <eos> on the day when the boy came in <eos> then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door <eos> till they thought that it never would end <eos> and he told her the tale of the terrible affair <eos> in the government store down in cherokee bend <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man said <eos> bout the dirty little kid at his side <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man did <eos> nor the deal or the way that he lied <eos> for three long days and three long nights <eos> they wept and they mourned and then <eos> she returned to her work and her weavin <eos> and they tried to forget about cherokee bend <eos> now the boy wasnt big but he hunted what he could <eos> and they lived for a time that way <eos> but the food run low and the meat went bad <eos> and she said to the boy one day <eos> im leaving tonight and i never will return <eos> >from the land of my spirit kin <eos> you must take what you need and trade what you can <eos> for a red mans grave down in cherokee bend <eos> it wasnt very long till she closed her eyes <eos> and he wrapped her in a robe <eos> he found her a place on the side of the hill <eos> and he buried her in the snow <eos> early in the spring he was seen in the town <eos> with his load looking ragged and thin <eos> not a year had gone by till he stood once again <eos> in the government store down in cherokee bend <eos> he was ten years tall and a redskin too <eos> so he hadnt much face to save <eos> and the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned <eos> at the talk of a criminals grave <eos> then the man from the east didnt smile when he said <eos> youre the son of that indian scum <eos> if you value your hide then you better abide <eos> by the white mans rules here in cherokee bend <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man said <eos> bout the dirty little kid at his side <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man did <eos> nor the deal or the way that he lied <eos> and he spit on the floor of the government store <eos> and it served him to no good end <eos> at the close of the day they had taken him away <eos> to the white mans school down at cherokee bend <eos> its been years since the boy disappeared <eos> where he run to nobody knows <eos> but they say he fell in with a man named jim <eos> and he rides in the rodeos <eos> and they say he returns all alone to a place <eos> hidden deep in the kentucky glen <eos> and its pretty well known who hauled up the stone <eos> to the grave on the hill above cherokee bend <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man said <eos> bout the dirty little kid at his side <eos> daddy didnt like what the white man did <eos> nor the deal or the way that he lied <eos> there was blood on the floor of the government store <eos> when the men took his daddy away <eos> it was and they never had a friend <eos> when he died by the rope down at cherokee bend <eos> it was and they never had a friend <eos> when he died by the rope down at cherokee bend he was standin by the highway <eos> with a sign that just said "mother" <eos> when he heard a driver comin <eos> bout a half a mile away <eos> then he held the sign up higher <eos> where no decent soul could miss it <eos> it was ten degrees or colder <eos> down by bolder dam that day <eos> he was raised up in milwaukee <eos> though he never was that famous <eos> he was just a road musician <eos> to the taverns he would go <eos> singin songs about the ramblin <eos> the lovin girls and gamblin <eos> how the world fell on his shoulders <eos> back in boulder i dont know <eos> it was out in arizona <eos> that he heard the lady listenin <eos> to each word that he was sayin <eos> to each line that he would write <eos> so he sat down by her table and <eos> they talked about the weather <eos> ninetyeight point six and risin <eos> down by boulder dam that day <eos> and she told him she would take him <eos> for a ride in the mornin sun <eos> back in boulder he had told her <eos> "i dont know when i had a better friend" <eos> now hes traded off his martin <eos> but his troubles are not over <eos> for his feet are almost frozen <eos> and the sun is sinkin low <eos> wont you listen to me brother <eos> if you ever loved your mother <eos> please

<eos> if you turn back to that page again <eos> and you cant win if you ask me ill tag along <eos> paper matches in the afternoon <eos> cups of tea and all of that zen <eos> i think its time we took a walk outside <eos> it seems there is no oxygen <eos> this time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone <eos> i believe its best we carry on <eos> smoke rings rising til they disappear <eos> in the sky above if you ask me ill tag along <eos> each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust <eos> when we get back where we belong <eos> if you ever turn that page again <eos> you need a friend if you ask me ill tag along <eos> this time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone <eos> i believe its best we carry on <eos> smoke rings rising til they disappear <eos> in the sky above if you ask me ill tag along all im after is to be on your winning side <eos> all i need is to be turning back the tide <eos> cause i care too much for the life that i lead <eos> what youre thinking could be anybodys guess <eos> all im after is the sun and the summer nights <eos> by the seashore dont want no more neon lights <eos> just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by <eos> aint it funny how the world seems to be back there in my dreams <eos> all i see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways <eos> aint it funny life feels different every day <eos> all im after is to be the flame in your tattoo <eos> be the one girl who can thrill me through and through <eos> this is just a guess but i must confess <eos> it feels better being certain <eos> please excuse my truthfulness <eos> what im seeings worth believing <eos> when you thrill me like you do <eos> so you wonder why my feelings never fade <eos> i think i got it made <eos> in the evening when the rain begins to fall <eos> thats when i wonder if you think of me at all <eos> but you sound so sad in your special way <eos> aint it funny life feels different with each new passing day <eos> all i need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways <eos> aint it funny how life changes every day if youd like to spend the afternoon approaching lavender <eos> youll feel just fine but one things sure <eos> youll never be the same

lavender i must be with you constantly <eos> your presence means so much to me <eos> much more that life itself <eos> oh sweet lavender as fragrant as the name you bear <eos> please cast away the clothes you wear <eos> and give your love to me <eos> oh sweet lavender your smile is like the golden sun <eos> id love to see you laugh and run <eos> as naked as the sea <eos> if youd like to spend the afternoon approaching lavender <eos> dont try and get the best of her <eos> she will not share the blame <eos> if youd like to try your hand at understanding lavender <eos> then you must be very

spiral like a wheel within a wheel <eos> never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel <eos> like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon <eos> like a carousel thats turning running rings around the moon <eos> like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face <eos> and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space <eos> like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind <eos> like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own <eos> down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone <eos> like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream <eos> or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream <eos> like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face <eos> and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space <eos> like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind <eos> keys that jingle in your pocket words that jangle in your head <eos> why did summer go so quickly was it something that you said <eos> lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand <eos> is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand <eos> pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song <eos> half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong <eos> when you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware <eos> that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair <eos> like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel <eos> never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel <eos> as the images unwind like the circles that you find <eos> in the windmills of your mind every night in my dreams <eos> i see you i feel you <eos> that is how i know you go on <eos> far across the distance <eos> and spaces between us <eos> you

told <eos> of bold leopolds last stands for the fatherland daylight <eos> see the dew on the sunflower <eos> and a rose that is fading <eos> roses whither away <eos> like the sunflower <eos> i yearn to turn my face to the dawn <eos> i am waiting for the day <eos> midnight <eos> not a sound from the pavement <eos> has the moon lost her memory <eos> she is smiling alone <eos> in the lamplight <eos> the withered leaves collect at my feet <eos> and the wind begins to moan <eos> memory <eos> all alone in the moonlight <eos> i can smile at the old days <eos> i was beautiful then <eos> i remember the time i knew what happiness was <eos> let the memory live again <eos> every streetlamp <eos> seems to beat a fatalistic warning <eos> someone mutters <eos> and the streetlamp gutters <eos> and soon it

<eos> to reflect back her blushes <eos> or give sigh for sigh <eos> ill not leave thee thou lone one <eos> to pine on the stem <eos> since the lovely are sleeping <eos> go sleep thou with them <eos> thus kindly i scatter <eos> thy leaves oer the bed <eos> where thy mates of the garden <eos> lie scentless and dead <eos> so soon may i follow <eos> when friendships decay <eos> and from loves shining circle <eos> the gems drop away <eos> when true hearts lie withered <eos> and fond ones are flown <eos> oh who would inhabit <eos> this bleak world alone sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears <eos> and in the hustle and bustle no sunshine appears <eos> but you and i have our love always there to remind us <eos> there is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us <eos> volare oh oh cantare oh oh oh oh <eos> lets fly way up to the clouds away from the maddening crowds <eos> we can sing in the glow of a star that i know of <eos> where lovers enjoy peace of mind <eos> let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind <eos> just like birds of a feather a rainbow together well find <eos> volare oh oh cantare oh oh oh oh <eos> no wonder my happy heart sings <eos> your love has given me wings <eos> your love has given me wings i give to you and you give to me <eos> true love true love <eos> so on and on it will always be <eos> true love true love <eos> for you and i

like lemon drops <eos> high above the chimney tops <eos> thats where youll find me <eos> somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly <eos> birds fly over the rainbow <eos> why then oh why cant i <eos>

<eos> the fighting man shall from the sun <eos> take warmth and life from the glowing earth <eos> speed with the lightfoot winds to run <eos> and with the trees to newer birth <eos> an allbright company of heaven <eos> hold him in high comradeship <eos> the dogstar and the sister seven <eos> the will to power and a sworded hip <eos> the woodland trees that stand together <eos> they stand to him each one a friend <eos> many enemies bring much honour <eos> and when the burning moment breaks <eos> and all things else are out of mind <eos> and only joy of battle takes <eos> him by the throat and makes him blind <eos> through joy and blindness he shall know <eos> not caring much to know that still <eos> nor lead nor steel shall reach him so <eos> that it be not his destined will <eos> many enemies bring much honour <eos> the thundering line of battle stands <eos> and in the air deaths history <eos> the day shall clasp him with strong hands <eos> the night shall hold sweet victory <eos> many enemies bring much honour and i shall your eyes <eos> into tears <eos> when all thats left <eos> are the hollows of devotion <eos> and out of vision <eos> we shall bring <eos> the void <eos> crowned with hoods <eos> and crying with hope <eos> eagle on arm <eos> and terror in eye <eos> resist and struggle <eos> your faith is a lie <eos> and the death of dreams <eos> shall be a beautiful end <eos> with flowers of filth <eos> and wine and fine men <eos> certains slips of the tongue <eos> are laced with disappointment <eos> with disappointment <eos> from start to end <eos> confront me with your dream <eos> and lives so cruel i curse <eos> and i shall turn your eyes <eos> into tears <eos> when all thats left <eos> are the hollows of devotion <eos> and out of vision <eos> we shall bring <eos> the void <eos> crowned with hoods <eos> and crying with hope <eos> and the death of dreams <eos> shall be a beautiful end <eos> with flowers of filth <eos> and wine and fine men many blurred dead kings faces <eos> move photolike through times gape and gauge <eos> the dull drums thud and drone <eos> is not heroic battlebeat <eos> this is the grey clocks cog <eos> there are not the banners of heroes <eos> or flags we should fly <eos> these are not proud pennants <eos> these are the clothes of prisoned mind <eos> these stumps of man on boxes <eos> are not the vox or voces <eos> of god or gods <eos> they are the forms of the breaths of dust <eos> this is the great ocean of birth and death <eos> kye ma kya ma <eos> oh paradise <eos> never lost and not to be gained here <eos> these are not the heroes <eos> these are not more than drenched earthtops <eos> these are not more than you or i <eos> listen <eos> i swear by the blank of the moon <eos> under the archen stars i stand alone <eos> i swear by the spiting sttreaming sun <eos> these cups of fire of waterred scales <eos> that cover our laughing round of spaces <eos> are nothing <eos> nothing <eos> like tho mouse with horns <eos> a fable full of lightless dark <eos> you are now to me the lost queen <eos> the new age and her train moves on <eos> behind the smiling lips concealed <eos> the clacking jaws of gummy rictus <eos> not motionless but motionless <eos> the savourless lines of open lies <eos> proclaim <eos> "this is a bes <eos> it shall ever be <eos> think of the things <eos> that shall never be" <eos> and our soul stalks empty hearted <eos> emptyhanded <eos> as it hangs its light <eos> on hooks of symbols <eos> hooks of gods and goath and hooks of crooks <eos> you must know this is not paradise <eos> father time spins on and grins and skips his <eos> scythe <eos> over our flowered heads <eos> and takes us to the muddy house <eos> of dreamless sleep <eos> oh this is not paradise <eos> all the empty buildings clutching <eos> bags of pain and bone and skin <eos> masks of despair and waterbruns <eos> the bells ring out and make no sense <eos> they make the skies bend <eos> through you wait for me <eos> this is not paradise <eos> through you wait for me <eos> this is not paradise open up you mind <eos> and ku ku ku baby <eos> and time will stand still for you <eos> seize the end of time <eos> and ku ku ku baby <eos> see it will be mine <eos> and ku ku ku baby <eos> i will bleed into the blind <eos> so ku ku ku baby <eos> and time will stand still for you <eos> open up you mind <eos> and ku ku ku baby there over there <eos> has gone goes and will go <eos> the copper sun <eos> tarnishes with the years tears <eos> the golden golden copper sun <eos> old eldest dead <eos> over the blue milky seasky <eos> loss and lost and losing <eos> do not wept <eos> all this is passing <eos> all the birds wing and fall <eos> through the heavens <eos> the cloudy clouds <eos> of snow of dew and of smoke <eos> a shuddering reflection <eos> vanishing with the dropped stone <eos> oh i wait under the spaces <eos> under the molten starrain <eos> the flashing falling planets <eos> do not wept <eos> all this is passing <eos> so high i could come <eos> so far i shall fall <eos> daedalus broken <eos> daedalus falling <eos> by the toothstones <eos> his shapes bends <eos> and makes s smiling bow <eos> he careers and spiral down <eos> falls <eos> he waves words of farewell <eos> "oh do not weep <eos> all of this passing <eos> to fail is human <eos> to fall is human <eos> to hope is human <eos> do not weep <eos> as the sound disappears <eos> as the rain falls <eos> as the sky parts <eos> as my tears fall <eos> do not weep <eos> i shall wait for you" <eos> daedalus broken <eos> daedalus falling <eos> do not wept <eos> all this is passing for you its very easy <eos> for you to spread the blame <eos> for you its very easy <eos> its done in anothers name <eos> holy water burns like acid <eos> incense subdues the sheep <eos> youre as clean as the virgin mary <eos> from your mouth the poison seeps <eos> i used to think it was funny <eos> but its very sad <eos> that so many can be fooled <eos> by a poor man in drag <eos> all you seek are confessions <eos> like you were a god <eos> giving rosary beads to the irish <eos> giving tambourines to the welsh <eos> youre crippled by guilt <eos> like a blamed dog <eos> she cant control her own body <eos> she must give it to god <eos> i used to think it was funny <eos> but its very sad <eos> that so many can be fooled <eos> by a poor man in drag smashed to bits <eos> in the peace of the night <eos> he craved power <eos> and to keep in <eos> hed change his spots <eos> or shed his skin <eos> he craved power <eos> smashed to bits <eos> in the peace of the night <eos> the power in the hour <eos> the art of the few <eos> original and best <eos> perpetuate nature <eos> unending largesse <eos> she craves power <eos> in attempts to stultify me <eos> your weakness your ideology <eos> smashed to bits <eos> in the peace of the night <eos> he craved power <eos> and to keep in <eos> hed change his spots <eos> or shed his skin <eos> like yapping dogs <eos> blind lead the blind <eos> those who chain the future <eos> are those time leaves behind <eos> is glory now gone <eos> a friendship worth of fiends <eos> is a rose without thorns drink with the nectar <eos> of submission <eos> i feel nothing more <eos> than existence <eos> a loneliness <eos> that will not <eos> come off <eos> in the narcissism <eos> of the harbour <eos> we are lost <eos> vaster then night <eos> my pride <eos> my threat <eos> my thrust <eos> this is beyond very fond <eos> all with beyond <eos> is this the final exorcism <eos> of an obsession <eos> in the obsession <eos> swept clean of the past <eos> and its errors <eos> shall we take new roads <eos> we shall take new roads <eos> look lost <eos> vast night <eos> tearing and loating <eos> thrashing without you <eos> to the church of tomorrow <eos> death is the martyr of beauty <eos> look kere is our runic wreath <eos> look here are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> as the petals of life <eos> decay <eos> "ignorance is bliss" <eos> the sad remiss <eos> to the clarion call <eos> of today <eos> see how it burns <eos> but we struggle in wyrd with amusement <eos> and contempt for all that holds <eos> sway <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> is the question i ask <eos> today <eos> see how they run <eos> kameradschaft <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> as their reason for life <eos> fades away <eos> petty beliefs petty platitudes <eos> all ring hollow day <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> as the blossom of life <eos> drifts away <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> is the question i ask today <eos> kameradschaft <eos> every angel knows <eos> the congress of liberty <eos> the sadness and smiles <eos> of our memories <eos> with this we let go <eos> our lady of the snows <eos> kameradschaft <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> as their meaning in life <eos> dies away <eos> are you close to <eos> or far from your conscience <eos> the question i ask today <eos> kameradschaft wrap your face in prayers <eos> the ones you sent in dust <eos> and know they never reach me <eos> you know they never reach me <eos> every blemish helps endear <eos> in this earthbound axis <eos> of stifling air <eos> the stifling air <eos> in this golden wedding of sorrow <eos> in this golden wedding <eos> blind and bleeding <eos> or merely spent <eos> we returned to the source <eos> to wait on our dream <eos> and a function disappears <eos> and a reason disappears <eos> and a meaning disappears <eos> all memories scream <eos> in this golden wedding of sorrow <eos> in this golden wedding <eos> black tears caress male things <eos> but my caresses only sour things <eos> at the dawn of the dusk of hope black angel black angel <eos> as you grow up <eos> i want you to drink <eos> from the plenty cup <eos> my little black angel <eos> my little black angel as years roll by <eos> i want you to fly with wings held high <eos> i want you to live by the justice code <eos> i want you to burn down freedoms road <eos> my little black angel <eos> oh lie away oh lie away sleeping <eos> lie away safe in my arms <eos> your father you future protects you <eos> and locks you safe from all harm <eos> little black angel i feel so glad <eos> youll never have things i never had <eos> when out of mens hearts all hate has gone <eos> its better to die than forever live on <eos> my little black angel this bondage <eos> it has no charms <eos> silence and evil weigh down my arms <eos> we know our god <eos> by the things he creates <eos> life beauty but most of all hate <eos> tell me your torment <eos> on unholy ground <eos> think of the times <eos> life turned around <eos> power has a fragnance <eos> how kreepy it krawls <eos> power has a fragnance <eos> let loose wehrwolves <eos> this bondage <eos> it has no charms <eos> silence and evil weigh down my arms <eos> we know our gods <eos> by the things they create <eos> life beauty but most of all hate where memories come <eos> and memories go <eos> to the globe of darkness <eos> turned a smoked window <eos> into the eye <eos> of my anger <eos> at being dragged <eos> into an arena <eos> the november man <eos> and the winds around <eos> observe this day <eos> of crystal sound <eos> aesthetics imposed <eos> apologies surpassed <eos> manoeuvring evenings <eos> of broken glass <eos> and truthfully pay <eos> and truthfully stay <eos> under the axe <eos> of a burntout day <eos> and truthfully pay <eos> and truthfully stay <eos> under the axe <eos> of a burntout day because of him <eos> this world has hope again <eos> because of him <eos> this world has got a friend <eos> a friend that will eradicate <eos> all lifes false humanity <eos> helping one race one creed <eos> to meet their need <eos> so that all may see <eos> that its all so wonderful to care <eos> to love to cull to share <eos> oh let us start today <eos> to live and die the same way something got hold of me <eos> oh yes it did i said <eos> something got hold of me <eos> it ratttled around my head <eos> i went to a meeting last night <eos> but my heart wasnt right <eos> something got hold of me <eos> oh yess it did i said <eos> something got hold of me <eos> it ratttled around my head <eos> early one morning <eos> on the mourners bench <eos> my heart it was filled with misery <eos> the same god that touched you one day <eos> he laid his hand on me wasted glorious dead <eos> it has to come <eos> all the dead are lost <eos> you me everyone <eos> our feelings thoughts <eos> ghosts couldnt see <eos> we closed the doors <eos> on eternity <eos> walk amongst this haunted <eos> crowd <eos> life dictates <eos> life pulls down <eos> life dictates <eos> its books of brown <eos> life dictates <eos> love pulls us down <eos> a slaughter of roses <eos> and a time to stop <eos> a fuhrer a butcher a lover <eos> a slaughter of roses <eos> and a time to crop <eos> meatfree <eos> on fire <eos> our feelings thoughts <eos> ghosts couldnt see <eos> we opened the doors <eos> of emergency <eos> wasted glorious dead <eos> it has to come <eos> all the dead are lost <eos> memories everyone <eos> all the dead are lost <eos> you me everyone i fall in love <eos> for a moment <eos> before i hit despair <eos> i turn around to see you <eos> another one is there <eos> how the bells of the clock <eos> how the bell do chime <eos> that awful reminder <eos> "you never will be mine" black sun dying <eos> black sun rising <eos> is this impure <eos> is this impure <eos> shadow of locust <eos> this is beast <eos> shadow of locust <eos> this is at least <eos> the slow descent of autumn <eos> into the butcher garden <eos> black sun dying <eos> black sun rising <eos> is this impure <eos> is this impure <eos> children its midnight <eos> its time weve come <eos> hand in hand <eos> on earth in hell <eos> sick or well <eos> were bleeding all over the world <eos> you and me <eos> on land and sea <eos> in life in dreams <eos> or so it seems <eos> new beginnings <eos> new ends <eos> its obvious <eos> its him <eos> the deafening <eos> beautiful <eos> silence <eos> of sin as pilgrims here we sometimes journey <eos> to who knows what to christ knows what <eos> come and sing this simple story <eos> that god forgot that life forgot <eos> dont you know god is disabled <eos> is disabled <eos> clouds may gather all around you <eos> but hes disabled <eos> hes no friend to the friendless <eos> and hes the mother of grief <eos> theres only sorrow for tomorrow <eos> surely life is too brief <eos> surely love is too brief <eos> dont you know god is disabled <eos> is disabled <eos> clouds may gather all around you <eos> but hes disabled time has a numbing effect <eos> i weep and i have wept <eos> to becomemore neutered <eos> to become more blank <eos> the fear of life <eos> "seeps from paradise" <eos> dark clouds come in <eos> and ask for more <eos> frost flowers freeze <eos> over frozen floors <eos> their petals broken <eos> illformed and stolen <eos> delirious with knowledge <eos> silver and golden <eos> time has a numbing effect <eos> i weep and i have wept <eos> the fear of life <eos> "seeps from paradise" <eos> the fear of life <eos> "seeps from paradise" <eos> dark clouds come in <eos> and ask for more <eos> frost flowers freeze <eos> over frozen pores <eos> their petals broken <eos> illformed and stolen <eos> delirious with knowledge <eos> silver and golden the dawn is ours <eos> if the dream is pure <eos> who invites the world <eos> to the final cure <eos> if it has to be <eos> then let it be now <eos> light the odin incence <eos> for the odin hour <eos> light the odin incence <eos> for the odin hour when life is but disappointment <eos> and nothing is amusing <eos> the one wild hunt <eos> for loneliness <eos> is a life without god <eos> is an end without love <eos> soulless today <eos> and soulless tomorrow <eos> we struggle for tthe joy <eos> oh we struggle for tthe joy <eos> that life is haunted by <eos> its memories its meaninglessness <eos> yearn to be gathered cracked and saved <eos> a thought for a life time <eos> a thought for a night time <eos> but what ends when the symbols shatter <eos> and who knows what happens to hearts <eos> but what ends when the symbols shatter <eos> and who knows what happens to hearts through the winters woods <eos> to the giddy edge of light <eos> we shut the door on pain <eos> those tales are dead dead forever <eos> a wind must agree <eos> to blow us on course <eos> it can be quick to come <eos> but once its gone its gone forever <eos> through the winters woods <eos> to the giddy edge of light <eos> we are all in the vein <eos> it is already too late <eos> what do we winess <eos> what do we negate <eos> in this world of shadows <eos> and sordid allusion <eos> through the winters woods <eos> to the giddy edge of light <eos> all this arrogance and ignorance <eos> will be washed away <eos> craving for tomorrow <eos> craving for today <eos> by association <eos> i want want everything <eos> through the winters woods <eos> to the giddy edge of light im alone <eos> youre alone <eos> the weary moon <eos> from the night before <eos> sinks into

<eos> so you sail cross the ocean away cross the foam <eos> to where youre a paddy a biddy or a mick <eos> good for nothing but stacking a brick <eos> your best mates a spade and he carries a hod <eos> two work horses heavily shod <eos> oh im missing you <eos> id give all for the price of a flight <eos> oh im missing you <eos> under piccadillys neon <eos> who did you murder are you a spy <eos> im just fond of a drink helps me laugh helps me cry <eos> so i just drink red biddy for a permanent high <eos> i laugh a lot less and ill cry till i die <eos> all ye young people now take my advice <eos> before crossing the ocean youd better think twice <eos> cause you cant live without love without love alone <eos> the proof is round london in the nobody zone <eos> where the summer is fine but the winters a fridge <eos> wrapped up in old cardboard under charing cross bridge <eos> and ill never go home now because of the shame <eos> of misfits reflection in a shop window pane it was one fine march morning i bid new orleans adieu <eos> and i took the road to jackson town my fortune to renew <eos> i cursed all foreign money no credit could i gain <eos> which filled my heart with a longing for the lakes of ponchartrain <eos> i stepped on board of a railroad car beneath the morning sun <eos> i rode the rods till evening and i laid me down again <eos> all strangers there no friends to me til a dark girl towards me came <eos> and i fell in love with the creole girl by the lakes of ponchartrain <eos> i said "me pretty creole girl me money heres no good <eos> if it werent for the alligators id sleep out there in the wood" <eos> "youre welcome here kind stranger from such sad thoughts refrain" <eos> "for me mammy welcomes strangers by the lakes of ponchartrain" <eos> she took me into her mammys house and treated me right well <eos> the hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell <eos> to try and paint here beauty im sure it would be in vain <eos> so handsome was my creole girl by the lakes of ponchartrain <eos> i asked her if shed marry me she said that neer could be <eos> for she had got a lover and he was far at sea <eos> she said that she would wait for him and true she would remain <eos> till hed return to his creole girl on the lakes of ponchartrain <eos> its fare thee well me creole girl ill never see you more <eos> ill never forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore <eos> and at each social gathering a flowing bowl ill drain <eos> and ill drink a health to my creole girl by the lakes of ponchartrain i am a sailor youre my first mate <eos> we signed on together we coupled our fate <eos> hauled up our anchor determined not to fail <eos> for the hearts treasure together we set sail <eos> with no maps to guide us we steered our own course <eos> rode out the storms when the winds were gale force <eos> sat out the doldrums in patience and hope <eos> working together we learned how to cope <eos> chorus <eos> life is an ocean and love is a boat <eos> in troubled water that keeps us afloat <eos> when we started the voyage there was just me and you <eos> now gathered round us we have our own crew <eos> together were in this relationship <eos> we built it with care to last the whole trip <eos> our true destinations not marked on any charts <eos> were navigating to the shores of the heart <eos> chorus x im goin to saddle up me old grey mare <eos> im goin to ride through the night <eos> without a worry or a care <eos> im a messenger boy bringing my love to you <eos> i see the light in the bedroom <eos> i pray to god that i didnt come too soon <eos> two big dogs and a man shouts "who goes there " <eos> ive ridden through the cold and the wind and the rain and the frost <eos> and the snow and im love and i do not feel the pain <eos> im a messenger boy bringing my love to you <eos> fade out ad lib vocals etc <eos> gdnaas beauty picks me up than throws me to the floor <eos> i may never know what i was searching for <eos> like a begger on my knees never knowing what i now believe <eos> like a drug i took the walk back to your door <eos> i had had enough but i always want more <eos> there was something i was needing <eos> something you were keeping <eos> and than with the rest of my days before me <eos> i broke down and fell asleep <eos> to your beating heart your beating heart your beating heart <eos> in the worst of all the best times we have shared <eos> through a sea of every now forgotten tear <eos> you would look me in the eye so afraid to ask me" why" <eos> but i knew you were the star that shines for me <eos> and i had already planned to set us free <eos> and in the black of the night i would ask you to be mine riving in a trance through your lost and lonely town <eos> something in the air that could blow your whole house down <eos> something like a tragedy <eos> something that you think you need <eos> turning on a dime you pull into your local store <eos> aisles going by and you forget what youre looking for <eos> maybe its a pot of gold <eos> maybe youre too lost to know <eos> maybe what you need is a different kind of love <eos> one that you have never seen <eos> maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey <eos> maybe what you need is a better kind of love <eos> one that you could only dream <eos> maybe it will take all the sorrow away <eos> and let you feel free <eos> nothing like a storm in your heart to wake you up <eos> someone by your side and you know theyre not enough <eos> maybe you should try and stay <eos> maybe you should walk away <eos> maybe what you need is a different kind of love <eos> one that you have never seen <eos> maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey <eos> maybe what you need is a better kind of love <eos> one that you could only dream <eos> maybe it will take all the sorrow away <eos> and let you feel free <eos> maybe you wake up to a brighter sun <eos> voices in your head screaming now the change has come <eos> with a different kind of love <eos> maybe what you need is a different kind of love <eos> one that you have never seen <eos> maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey <eos> maybe what you need is a different kind of love <eos> maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey <eos> maybe what you need is a better kind of love <eos> maybe it will take all the sorrow away and let you feel free woke up early from my bed <eos> with a secret in my head <eos> in the back of my backyard <eos> i keep a spaceship in the shed <eos> i lit the engine and took the sky <eos> from up here it looks so nice <eos> i didnt stop until the moon where i <eos> picked a flower just for you <eos> chorus <eos> and i fell down to you in a parachute of <eos> newspaper rubber bands tape and glue <eos> so you would see i would do anything for you <eos> anything for you <eos> i didnt want to wake you up <eos> so i put the flower in a cup <eos> on the floor next to your bed <eos> without a sound i laid my head <eos> drifted off into a dream <eos> of what has been and what could be <eos> i saw your tears i saw you fall <eos> but i saw us rise i saw it all <eos> and i fell down to you in a parachute of <eos> newspaper rubber bands tape and glue <eos> so you would see that i would do anything for you <eos> anything for you <eos> and i never want you to know <eos> all of the lengths ill go <eos> to find where the flowers grow <eos> love is never supposed to be <eos> a present under our tree <eos> i do it because i believe <eos> chorus <eos> i fell down to you in a parachute of <eos> newspaper rubber bands tape and glue <eos> so you would see that i would do anything for you <eos> anything for you <eos> anything for you deep is the water under my bridge <eos> flowing <eos> short is the lifetime that ive lived <eos> knowing <eos> messing up and starting over <eos> again <eos> maybe all the breaks <eos> and the young mistakes <eos> were supposed to carry me here <eos> this time

killed in battle he will now take the "low road" or the spiritual road back home to scotland <eos> while moira his love stays on the "high road" or the earthbound road <eos> this concept is based on a

lassie <eos> go <eos> chorus dear sir i write this note to you to tell you of my plight <eos> for at the time of writing it im not a pretty sight <eos> my body is all black blue my face a deathly grey <eos> and i write this note to say why i am not at work today <eos> while working on the th floor some bricks i had to clear <eos> but tossing them down from such a height was not a good idea <eos> the foreman wasnt very pleased he is an awkward sod <eos> and he said i had to cart them down the ladders in me hod <eos> well clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow <eos> so i hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below <eos> but in my haste to do the job i was too blind to see <eos> that a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me <eos> and so when i untied the rope the barrel fell like lead <eos> and clinging tightly to the rope i started up instead <eos> i shot up like a rocket and to my dismay i found <eos> that half way up i met the bloody barrel coming down <eos> the barrel broke my sholder as to the ground it sped <eos> and when i reached the top i banged the pulley with my head <eos> i clung on tightly numb with shock from this almighty blow <eos> while the barrel spilled out half its bricks some floors below <eos> now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor <eos> i then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more <eos> but i clung on tightly to the rope my body racked with pain <eos> and half way down i met the barrel once again <eos> the force of this collision half way down the office block <eos> caused multiple abbraisions and a nasty case of shock <eos> but i clung on tightly to the rope as i fell towards the ground <eos> and landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round <eos> well as i lay there on the floor i thought id passed the worst <eos> but the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst <eos> a shower of bricks rained down on me i didnt have a hope <eos> as i lay there bleeding on the ground i let go of the bloody rope <eos> the barrel now being heavier it started down once more <eos> it landed right across me as i lay there on the floor <eos> it broke three ribs and my left arm and i can only say <eos> i hope you understand why i am not at work today well ive been a sunday driver noo for manys a happy year <eos> and ive never had my morris minor oot o

weã¢ââd sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> the last of barrettã¢ââs privateers <eos> on the kings

sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> the last of barrettã¢ââs privateers <eos> the yankee lay low down with gold <eos> i wish i was in ã¢ââ¦ now <eos> she was low and fat and loose stays <eos> but to catch her took the antelope three whole days <eos> god damn them all <eos> i was told weã¢ââd sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> the last of barrettã¢ââs privateers <eos> but at length we stood two

sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> the last of barrettã¢ââs privateers <eos> well the antelope shook

on my twentyfifth year <eos> i wish i was inã¢ââ¦ now <eos> six years since we sailed away <eos> but i just made halifax yesterday <eos> god damn them all <eos> i was told weã¢ââd sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> the last of barrettã¢ââs privateers <eos> god damn them all <eos> i was told weã¢ââd sail the seas <eos> for american gold <eos> weã¢ââd fire no guns shed no tears <eos> iã¢ââm a broken man on a halifax pier <eos> sailed the seas for many a long year <eos> youã¢ââll never find a better man far or near <eos> iã¢ââm a last of barrettã¢ââs privateers some poets sing of a noble king <eos> or of a sweetheart fair <eos> some tell a tale of ships that sail <eos> with treasures rich and rare <eos> but my humble pen still drifts again <eos> to scenes of long ago <eos> across the sea to the benedy <eos> and the winding river roe <eos> right well do i remember now <eos> those happy childhood days <eos> and the times i had when just a lad <eos> on carns lovely braes <eos> and when my mind is thus inclined <eos> no other joys i know <eos> for my heart remains on the verdant plains <eos> near the winding river roe <eos> benbradaghs crown oer dungiven town <eos> is still within my view <eos> and the benedy glen i worshiped then <eos> still lives in memory too <eos> the beautiful scene of cashel green <eos> still haunts wherever i go <eos> and in all my dreams i see it seems <eos> the winding river roe <eos> if fortunes smiles on me awhile <eos> i would cross the sea again <eos> and all these years of toil and tears <eos> will be forgotten then <eos> and when at last my life has passed <eos> contentedly ill go across the sea <eos> to the benedy <eos> and the winding river roe the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing <eos> and the corn it ripens fastest when the frost is setting in <eos> and when the young man tells me that my face hell soon forget <eos> before we part i bet a crown hed be fain to follow it yet <eos> and the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing <eos> and the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring <eos> but when spring blows and winter goes my love then youll be free <eos> with all your pride and to follow me where it crossed the stormy sea <eos> and the snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing <eos> and the bee that flew when summer shone in winter he wont sing <eos> and all the flowers in all the land so brightly they may be <eos> and the snow it melts the soonest when my true loves for me <eos> so whoever says to me farewell here no farewell i receive <eos> for you will leave me at your side or you kiss and take your leave <eos> and ill wait here til the moorcock calls and the martin takes his leave <eos> for the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing leaving sweet lovely derry for fair london town <eos> there is no finer harbour all around can be found <eos> where the youngsters each evening go down to the shore <eos> and the joy bells are ringing for the maid of culmore <eos> the first time i saw her she passed me by <eos> and the next time i saw her she bid me goodbye <eos> but the last time i saw her it grieved my heart sore <eos> for she sailed down loch foyle and away from culmore <eos> if i had the power the storms for to rise <eos> i would make the wind blow and id darken the skies <eos> i would make the wind blow high and the salt seas to roar <eos> till the day that my darling sailed away from culmore <eos> to the back parts of america my love ill go and see <eos> for its there i know noone and noone knows me <eos> and if i dont find her ill return home no more <eos> like a pilgrim ill wander for the maid of culmore shes like the swallow that flies so high <eos> shes like the river that never runs dry <eos> shes like the sunshine on the lee shore <eos> she loves her love and love is no more <eos> ã¢tis out in the meadow this fair maid did go <eos> picking the lovely primrose <eos> the more she plucked the more she pulled <eos> until shes got her apron full <eos> she climbed on yonder hill above <eos> to give a rose unto her love <eos> she gave him one she gave him three <eos> she gave her heart for company <eos> and as they sat on yonder hill <eos> his heart grew hard so harder still <eos> he has two hearts instead of one <eos> she says young man what have you done "oh rise up my darling and come with me <eos> i want to go with you and leave this country <eos> to leave my fathers dwelling this house and the land <eos> so away goes jamie with his love in his arms <eos> they go over hills and the mountains and glens <eos> traveling all through the night in the mist in the rain <eos> but her father has followed and has taken his men <eos> and he captured poor jamie with his love in his arms <eos> now home she was taken to her room she is bound <eos> while poor jamie lies on the cold stoney ground <eos> and he knows all the while before the judge he will stand <eos> for the stealing of nothing but his own true loves hand <eos> in the cold hard iron his hands they are bound <eos> handcuffed like a murderer and tied to the ground <eos> and the goaler tells jamie "last night i did hear <eos> that your lady will hang you or else set you clear" <eos> the judge says "this young girl being tender in youth <eos> if jamie is guilty she will tell the truth" <eos> then the radiant beauty before him did stand <eos> "oh im happy to see you my bold irish lad" <eos> but the father cries out "lord have pity on me <eos> for the man came to bring disgrace to my family <eos> and he stole my only daughter all part of his plan <eos> and if you dont hang him i will quit the land" <eos> but the daughter is crying and begging is she <eos> "the fault isnt jamies the blame lies with me <eos> i forced him to leave and run away with me <eos> and ill die if i cant save my bold jamie" <eos> "good lord he has stole all her jewels and her rings <eos> gold watches and amber all my precious things <eos> and it costs me a fortune in thousands of pounds <eos> and ill take the life of jamie before i lie in the ground <eos> "good lord i gave them as a token of love <eos> an when we are parted ill have them removed <eos> but a true lovers token wear on your right hand <eos> and think of me darling when youre in a foreign land" kind friends and companions together combine <eos> and raise up your voices in chorus with mine <eos> let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain <eos> for we may and might never all meet here again <eos> chorus <eos> heres a health to the company and one to my lass <eos> let us drink and be merry all out of one glass <eos> let us drink and be merry all grief to refrain <eos> for we may and might never all meet here again <eos> heres a health to the wee lass that i love so well <eos> her style and her beauty theres none can excel <eos> theres a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee <eos> sure theres no one in in this wide world as happy as me <eos> chorus <eos> our ship lies at harbor shes ready to dock <eos> i hope shes safe landed without shake or shock <eos> and when we are sailing to the land of the free <eos> i will always remember your kindness to me <eos> i have read this old proverb ive read it so true <eos> my love is as fair as the bright morning dew <eos> i have read this old proverb i suppose you have too <eos> so good friends and companions i bid you adieu <eos> chorus green grows the laurel soft falls the dew <eos> sorry was i love when parting from you <eos> but at our next meeting i hope youll prove true <eos> and well join the green laurel and the violet so blue <eos> i once had a sweetheart but now i have none <eos> hes gone and hes left me to weep and to mourn <eos> hes gone and hes left me for others to see <eos> ill soon find another far better than he <eos> he passes my window both early and late <eos> and the looks that he gives me would make my heart break <eos> the looks that he gives me a thousand would kill <eos> though hates and detests me i love that lad still <eos> i wrote him a letter in red rosy lines <eos> he wrote back an answer all twisted and twined <eos> saying keep your love letters and ill keep mine <eos> you write to your love and ill write to mine <eos> now often i wonder why maidens love men <eos> and often i wonder why young men love them <eos> but from my own knowledge i will have you know <eos> the men are deceivers wherever they go <eos> green grows the laurel soft falls the dew <eos> sorry was i love when parting from you <eos> but at our next meeting i hope youll prove true <eos> and well join the green laurel and the violet so blue farewell to old ireland the land of my childhood <eos> which now and forever i am going to leave <eos> farewell to the shores where the shamrock is growing <eos> its the bright spot of beauty and the home of the brave <eos> ill think on its valleys with fond admiration <eos> though never again its bright hills will i see <eos> im bound for to cross the wide swelling ocean <eos> in search of fame and fortune and of sweet liberty <eos> our ship at the present lies in derry harbour <eos> to bear us away across the wide swelling sea <eos> may heaven be her companion and grant her fair breezes <eos> till we reach the green fields of america <eos> its hard to be forced from the land that we live in <eos> our houses and farms all obiged for to sell <eos> to wander along among indians and strangers <eos> to find some sweet spot where our children might dwell <eos> our artists our farmers our tradesmen are leaving <eos> to seek for employment far over the sea <eos> where theyll get their riches with care and with industry <eos> theres nothing but hardship at home if you stay <eos> so cheer up your spirits you lads and you lasses <eos> theres gold for the digging and lots of it too <eos> a health to the heart that has courage to ramble <eos> bad luck to the lad or the lass that would rue <eos> well call for a bumper of ale wine and brandy <eos> well drink to the health of those far away <eos> our hearts will all warm at the thought of old ireland <eos> when were on the green fields of americay where are you now <eos> and whos by your side <eos> cant hide for a lifetime <eos> uncover your eyes <eos> wake up in the morning <eos> share the sunlight shining down on us <eos> you and me <eos> are these sad days always lost on us <eos> where am i now <eos> and whos on my side <eos> id wait for a lifetime <eos> for you to come back <eos> wake up in the evening <eos> share the moonlight shining down on us <eos> you and me <eos> are these sad days always lost on us <eos> can anyone play me another sad song <eos> cause sad songs remind me of all that weve lost <eos> can anyone play me another sad song <eos> cause sad songs remind me of all that weve lost <eos> wake up in the morning <eos> share the sunlight shining down on us <eos> you and me <eos> you and me my song for you this evening <eos> is not to make you sad <eos> nor for adding to the sorrows <eos> of this troubled northern land <eos> but lately ive been thinking <eos> and it just wont leave my mind <eos> ill tell you about two friends one time <eos> who were both good friends of mine <eos> isaac he was protestant <eos> and sean was catholic born <eos> but it never made a difference <eos> for the friendship it was strong <eos> and sometimes in the evening <eos> when they heard the sound of drums <eos> they said they wont divide us <eos> we will always be as one <eos> there were roses roses <eos> there were roses <eos> and the tears of a people ran together <eos> it was on a sunday morning <eos> when the awful news came round <eos> another killing had been done <eos> just outside newry town <eos> we knew that isaac danced up there <eos> we knew he liked the band <eos> but when we heard that he was dead <eos> we just could not understand <eos> now fear it filled the countryside <eos> there was fear in every home <eos> when late at night a car came <eos> prowling round the ryan road <eos> a catholic would be killed tonight <eos> to even up the score <eos> oh christ its young macdonald <eos> they have taken from the door <eos> there were roses roses <eos> there were roses <eos> and the tears of a people ran together <eos> isaac was my friend he cried <eos> he begged them with his tears <eos> but centuries of hatred <eos> have ears that do not hear <eos> an eye for an eye <eos> that was all that filled their minds <eos> and another eye for another eye <eos> till everyone was blind <eos> now i dont know where the moral is <eos> or where the song should end <eos> but i wonder just how many wars <eos> are fought between good friends <eos> and those who give the orders <eos> are not the ones to die <eos> its scott and young macdonald <eos> and the likes of you and i <eos> there were roses roses <eos> there were roses <eos> and the tears of a people ran together turn it inside out so i can seeuh <eos> the part of you thats drifting over meuh <eos> and when i wake youreyoure never there <eos> and when i sleep youreyoure everywhere <eos> youre everywhere <eos> just tell me how i got this far <eos> just tell me why youre here and who you are <eos> cause every time i look <eos> youre never there <eos> and every time i sleep <eos> youre always there <eos> cause youre everywhere to me <eos> and when i close my eyes its you i see <eos> youre everything i know <eos> that makes me believe <eos> im not alone <eos> im not alone <eos> i recognize the way you make me feel <eos> its hard to think that you might not be real <eos> i sense it now the waters getting deep <eos> i try to wash the pain away from me <eos> away from me <eos> cause youre everywhere to me <eos> and when i close my eyes its you i see <eos> youre everything i know <eos> that makes me

river follow you till night <eos> i hasten to your whispers you dance in time to mine <eos> well stay awake together watching the silver in the sky <eos> blue mountain river i want to rest a while <eos> youre changing my reflection and the seasons in my mind <eos> let these days go on forever ill leave in my own time <eos> take me where youre going and ill be right by your side <eos> blue mountain river i went there for a while <eos> i listened for an answer and i found it deep inside <eos> when im lost behind the shadows and i want to run and hide <eos> my blue mountain river is there right by my side after the morning there comes an evening <eos> and after the evening another day <eos> and after a false love there comes a true love <eos> id have you listen now to what i say <eos> i swear my love is the finest young man <eos> as fair as any the sun shines on <eos> but how to save him i do not know it <eos> for he has got a sentence to be hung <eos> as he was marching the streets of derry <eos> i own he marched up right manfully <eos> being much more like a commanding officer <eos> than a man to die upon the gallows tree <eos> "what keeps my love so long in coming <eos> oh what detains her so long from me <eos> or does she think it a shame or scandal <eos> to see me die upon the gallows tree" <eos> he looked around and he saw her coming <eos> and she was dressed all in woolen fine <eos> the weary steed that my love was riding <eos> it flew more swiftly than the wind <eos> come down come down from that cruel gallows <eos> ive got your pardon from the king <eos> and ill let them see that they dare not hang you <eos> and ill crown my love with a bunch of green i wish i was in heaven high <eos> for night and day i just wait and cry <eos> and from my arms he flew one night <eos> to where i cannot find <eos> i wish i had the wings to fly <eos> for in this world he left no sign <eos> but maybe someday hell bring me back <eos> to where i cannot find <eos> had i the heart to tell him then <eos> he might have stayed until the end <eos> but maybe someday well meet again of the <eos> in where i cannot find black is the colour of my true loves hair <eos> her lips are like a rose so fair <eos> shes got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands <eos> i love the ground whereon she stands <eos> i love my love and well she knows <eos> i love the ground whereon she goes <eos> and how i wish the day would come <eos> when she and i can be as one <eos> black is the colour of my true loves hair <eos> her lips are like a rose so fair <eos> shes got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands <eos> i love the ground whereon she stands <eos> i go to the clyde and mourn and weep <eos> satisfied i never will sleep <eos> ill write her a letter just a few short lines <eos> and suffer death ten thousand times it being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing <eos> down by yon shady harbour i carelessly did stray <eos> the thrushes they were warbling the violets they were charming <eos> to view fond lovers talking a while i did delay <eos> she said my dear dont leave me all for another season <eos> though fortune does be pleasing ill go along with you <eos> ill forsake friends and relations and bid this irish nation <eos> and to the bonny bann banks forever ill bid adieu <eos> he said my dear dont grieve or yet annoy my patience <eos> you know i love you dearly the more im going away <eos> im going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation <eos> to comfort us hereafter all in america <eos> then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing <eos> "twill cause them for to smile at our late going away <eos> well be happy as queen victoria all in her greatest glory <eos> well be drinking wine and porter all in america <eos> if you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying <eos> the sight of the lovely bann banks your sorrow youd give oer <eos> or if were down one hour down in yon shady bower <eos> pleasure would surround you youd think on death no more <eos> then fare you well sweet craigie hill where often times ive roved <eos> i never thought my childhood days id part you any more <eos> now were sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion <eos> and the bonny boats are sailing way down by doorin shore the leaves fall from the trees like gold <eos> and i tell you that i love you so <eos> the river sings its time to go <eos> what lies ahead well never know <eos> and summer brings sweet memories <eos> when we danced all night on the dusty streets <eos> with an angel watching over me <eos> your love has brought me to my knees <eos> chorus <eos> well ive loved you and i wish it so <eos> wherever you decide to go <eos> yes ive loved you well i wish it so <eos> wherever you decide to

inside out <eos> do you believe it is worth the fight <eos> chorus this is really not my home <eos> oh where are you my lovely johnny <eos> im afraid and all alone <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> im sitting in the strangers room <eos> playing at the strangers table <eos> shining empty like the moon <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> chorus <eos> but in the darkness struggle cold <eos> i think about a garden valley <eos> gentle as the leaves unfold <eos> singing out across the bay <eos> distant and so far away <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> im blinded by your city lights <eos> i wander through these fearful places <eos> the colours fade to black and white <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> and these are not the friends i know <eos> these are not their smiling faces <eos> a desert that noone should know <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> chorus <eos> now i know and feel it well <eos> poor immigrants deep sunken feeling <eos> standing at the gates of hell <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> burned out by their masters greed <eos> cruel exile transportation <eos> robbed of every love and need <eos> there is no peace for me <eos> chorus if you want me ill be at your door <eos> and if you need me ill be by your side <eos> cause every day is a long winding road <eos> and ill always be here dont you know <eos> i wonder why i wonder why i wonder why <eos> i always try i wonder why i wonder why <eos> chorus <eos> every time i look at you i feel the blues <eos> cant hide the pain inside <eos> noone ever told me that my heart could break a hundredthousand times <eos> never in a million years i thought the tears could break a heart of stone <eos> if you need me let me know <eos> well if youve got noone to give your heart to <eos> and if youve searched and you cant find the truth <eos> when they tell you this time to let go <eos> well ill always be here dont you know <eos> i wonder why i wonder why i wonder why <eos> chorus <eos> oh nobody told me bout the wind and the trees <eos> and the summer breeze and <eos> you carry the weight of the world on your shoulders <eos> and the light is slipping through <eos> and ive seen the sun catching your eye <eos> like the moon in the sky <eos> every time i look at you i feel the blues <eos> cant hide the pain inside <eos> noone ever told me that my heart could break a hundredthousand times <eos> and though youve never asked me to believe its true <eos> ive loved you from the start <eos> oh ive got to find a way to mend today <eos> these wings that need to fly <eos> noone ever told me that my heart could break a hundredthousand times <eos> never in a million years i thought the tears could break a heart of stone <eos> if you need me let me know as the lonesome scenes of winter in stormy winds do blow <eos> clouds around the centre inclined to frost and snow <eos> youre the boy that i have chosen to be my only dear <eos> your scornful heart is frozen and drifted far i fear <eos> one night i went to see my love but he proved most scornfully <eos> i asked him if hed marry me but he would not marry me <eos> the night it is far spent my love its near the break of day <eos> and im waiting for your answer my dear what do you say <eos> i can but plainly tell you ill lead a single life <eos> i never thought it fitting that you should be my wife <eos> so take a civil answer and for yourself provide <eos> i have another sweetheart and you i have laid aside <eos> now my mind is changing that old love for the new <eos> this wide and lonesome valley i mean to ramble through <eos> in search of someone handsome that might my fancy fill <eos> that world is wide and lonesome if he dont another will in a land of ocahan where bleak mountains rise <eos> oer those brown ridgy tops now the dusky clouds fly <eos> deep sunk in a valley a wild flower did grow <eos> and her name was finvola the gem of the roe <eos> for the isles of abunde appeared to out view <eos> a youth clad in tartan its strange but its true <eos> with a star on his breast and unstrung was his bow <eos> and he sighed for finvola the gem of the roe <eos> the gem of the roe the gem of the roe <eos> and he sighed for finvola <eos> the gem of the roe <eos> to the grey shores of alba his bride he did bear <eos> but short were the fond years these lovers did share <eos> for thrice on the hillside the banshee cried low <eos> twas the death of finvola the gem of the roe <eos> the gem of the roe the gem of the roe <eos> twas the death of finvola <eos> the gem of the roe <eos> no more up the streamlet her maidens will hie <eos> for wan the pale cheek and bedimmed the blue eye <eos> in silent affliction our sorrows will flow <eos> since gone is finvola the gem of the roe <eos> the gem of the roe the gem of the roe <eos> since gone is finvola <eos> the gem of the roe days turning from red to green <eos> its hard to believe that spring <eos> is here so soon and ive been gone so long <eos> keep sending your letters on <eos> memories of whom are still <eos> haunting my days and i am losing my way <eos> chorus <eos> high tide <eos> changing moods <eos> familiar faces i know <eos> high tide <eos> changing light <eos> familiar places i go <eos> keep playing our favorite song <eos> cause sometimes i sing it so loud <eos> and pray that you might hear <eos> and sing along <eos> days turning from sweet to dry <eos> memories of whom are still <eos> haunting my days i wait <eos> for your reply through the mist my ship has sailed leaving me behind <eos> all things left unsaid that were in my mind <eos> when i stood on this deck strange things i saw <eos> strange they have vanished now <eos> im standing on the shore <eos> sandy hills all around nothing standing clear <eos> softly light is falling through time was never here <eos> when i stood on this deck stranges things i saw <eos> strange they have vanished now <eos> im standing on the shore <eos> headlands fading out of sight horizons disappear <eos> hazy shores and silent seas nothing do i fear <eos> air and water grass and sand merging into one <eos> in the silence of the mist i am still alone <eos> when i stood on this deck strange things i saw <eos> strange they have vanished now <eos> im standing on the shore <eos> standing on the shore oh father dear father <eos> youve done to me much wrong <eos> youve gone and got me married to a boy <eos> who is too young <eos> for he is only years and i am <eos> oh my darling boy is young but hes growing <eos> oh daughter dear daughter <eos> its you who have done wrong <eos> for you and he together have gone and got a son <eos> and he must have a father when i am dead and gone <eos> oh your darling boy is young but hes growing <eos> one day as i was walking down by the college wall <eos> i saw the young men they were playing football <eos> my true love was there he was the finest of them all <eos> my darling boy is young but hes growing <eos> another day i was walking down by the college wall <eos> i saw the pusher he was making his call <eos> my true love was there he was the palest of them all <eos> oh the dealer put an end to his growing <eos> at the age of sixteen years he was a married man <eos> and at the age of seventeen the father of a son <eos> the grass grew over him <eos> the dealer put an end to his growing <eos> oh the springtime is past <eos> and the summers coming on <eos> its earring beads and bangles the young girls <eos> have put on <eos> once i had a true love but now i have got none <eos> but i ll watch over his son while hes growing as i was awalking one evening of late <eos> where fragrant fine flowers the fields decorate <eos> i carelessly rambled where i did not know <eos> by the fair crystal fountain that falls in glencoe <eos> and on her who the prize on mount ider was won <eos> then approached me a lassy as bright as the sun <eos> and the ribbon and the tartan around her did flow <eos> that welcomed young donald the pride of glencoe <eos> said i my fine creature your charming sweet smile <eos> and your comely fine features my heart has beguiled <eos> and with your kind affection on me youll bestow <eos> ill bless the happy hour we met in glencoe <eos> kind sir she made answer your love ill disdain <eos> for i have a young sweetheart and donald by name <eos> and he went to the wars about ten years ago <eos> and a maid i remain till he returns to glencoe <eos> ah perhaps your young donald regards not your name <eos> and has placed his affection on some foreign dame <eos> he may have forgotten for all that you know <eos> that bonny young creature he left in glencoe <eos> from his promise my donald hed never depart <eos> for love truth and honour stand firm in his heart <eos> and if i never see him then single ill go <eos> and mourn for my donald the pride of glencoe <eos> then seeing her constance he drew out a glove <eos> which in parting she gave him in token of love <eos> she clung to his arms and tears down did flow <eos> ah youre welcome my donald the pride of glencoe <eos> come cheer up my flora your sorrows are oer <eos> and since we have met love well never part more <eos> and the loud blast of battle far distant may blow <eos> whilst in peace and contentment well live in glencoe oh draw near each young lover <eos> give ear to my story <eos> that bears my sad mournful tale <eos> come join me in chorus <eos> and lend me your pity <eos> while i my misfortune bewail <eos> the grief my poor heart <eos> no tongue can disclose <eos> my cheeks are now pale <eos> they once bloomed like the rose <eos> and its all for a young man <eos> whom i do suppose <eos> is now far from sweet erin the green <eos> now when were children <eos> we walked out together <eos> along the green meadows sweet <eos> and although we were childish <eos> we loved one another <eos> whilst gathering the wild berries sweet <eos> it was to sweet garvagh where we were sent to school <eos> he was first in his class <eos> and correct in each rule <eos> and i cheerfully walked home by kilnacoole <eos> with the flower of sweet erin the green <eos> oh his head on my breast <eos> and he used to repose <eos> at each evening under the shade <eos> a song in my praises my darling composed <eos> and he styled me the cool derry maid <eos> at the time i denied him id die for his sake <eos> it was little i thought my denial hed take <eos> oh but my own misfortune <eos> i made a mistake <eos> when he left me on erin the green when you feel so tired trying <eos> when you ask and noone knows <eos> when your heart is tired fighting <eos> when you feel like letting go <eos> take this love ive freely given <eos> take this dream im wishing for <eos> chorus <eos> how long is forever <eos> if i cant see you anymore <eos> ill miss you most whenever october winds begin to blow <eos> well these days have lost their meaning <eos> and these nights can feel so cold <eos> endless days not ever knowing <eos> what is all this suffering for <eos> take these words "so sad to leaveing" <eos> take this breath i breathe thats warm <eos> take these tears so softly falling <eos> take these love forever more <eos> chorus one night as i lay slumbering in my silent bed alone <eos> some reckless thoughts came to my mind which caused me for to roam <eos> to leave my native country and the wee girl i do adore <eos> so i thought it fit to take a trip strange lands for to explore <eos> now the night before i went away i was walking over brockagh hill <eos> when i met my darling on the road and her eyes with tears did fill <eos> "stay you at home dear john" she said "and do not go away <eos> for ill have none to comfort me when you are on the sea" <eos> well i took her by the lily white hand and i held her hard and fast <eos> saying "adieu to you my darling for my ship it lies in belfast <eos> but if you prove loyal sure ill prove true for you know that im well inclined" <eos> so we kissed goodbye and parted and i left my girl behind <eos> and when we landed in greenock sure the people all gathered around <eos> and they said i was a rakish lad come to put their harvest down <eos> they told me to return again and never more be seen <eos> so without delay i sailed away for irelands lovely green <eos> sure when mary heard that john was home her heart did beat with joy <eos> saying "come into my arms" she cried "youre my darling lovely boy" <eos> saying "come into my arms" she cried "of you i have thought great and long <eos> and let them all say as they will our wedding will now go on <eos> and let them all say as they as they will youre the one whos nearly breaking my heart <eos> had your chance you just threw it all away <eos> living in a world that you could never be a part of <eos> and theres time to walk away <eos> you cant stay no you cant stay <eos> youre no loser theres still time to ride that train <eos> and you must be on your way tonight <eos> think a

of the day <eos> for a tender beaming smile to my hope has been granted <eos> and tomorrow he shall hear all my fond heart longs to say <eos> i will tell him all my love all my souls pure adoration <eos> and i know he will hear my voice and he will not answer me nay <eos> it is this that gives my soul all its joyous elation <eos> as i hear the sweet lark sing in the clear air of the day i am a youth thats inclined to ramble <eos> to some foreign country i mean to steer <eos> i am loath to part from my friends and comrades <eos> and my dear sweetheart whom i loved dear <eos> but theres one of those i do most admire <eos> one her ill think when im far away <eos> for since fates decreed i am resolved to part her <eos> and try my fortune in americay <eos> so farewell darling i must leave you <eos> i place great dependence on your constancy <eos> that no other young man may gain your favor <eos> or change your mind when i am over the sea <eos> for although the seas do separate us <eos> and in between us they do rise and fall <eos> if fortune favors me youll find your jamie <eos> returning homeward from americay <eos> oh jamie dear do you remember <eos> when i sat with you for many the hour <eos> and my young fancy away was carried <eos> and the bees hummed around on each opening flower <eos> but when youre crossing the western ocean <eos> the maid that loved you youll never mind eva <eos> and youll scarce ever think upon the maids of erin <eos> for youll find strange sweethearts in america <eos> oh mary dear i dont dissemble <eos> for to all other fair maids ill prove untrue <eos> and if you think that these are false promise <eos> ill leave these vows as a pledge to you <eos> that what i have may prove unsuccessful <eos> and fortune prove to me a slippery ball <eos> that a favoring gale it may never blow on me <eos> if forsake you in america <eos> and to conclude and to end these verses <eos> may god protect this young female fair <eos> and keep her from every wild embarrassment <eos> and of my darling take the greatest care <eos> for shes slow to anger and of kind disposition <eos> and her cheeks like roses in june do blow <eos> in my nightly slumbers when ever i think on her <eos> i could court her vision in america come all you gallant poachers who ramble void of care <eos> who wander out on a moonlit night with your dog your gun and snare <eos> the hare and lofty pheasant you have at your command <eos> not thinking of your long career spend on van diemans land <eos> poor thomas brown from nenagh town john murphy and poor joe <eos> where three determined poachers the country well does know <eos> by the keepers of the land one night at last they were trepanned <eos> and for fourteen years transported unto van diemans land <eos> the first day that we landed upon that fatal shore <eos> the planters gathered around us they might be twenty score <eos> they ranked us off like horses and sold us out of hand <eos> they yoked us to a plough brave boys to plough van diemans land <eos> often when i slumber i have a pleasant dream <eos> i m lying on the cold green grass down by your purling stream <eos> oh wondering through the maid of fair with my sweetheart by the hand <eos> then i awaken brokenhearted upon van diemans land every time you touch my face <eos> every time you touch my face <eos> i feel your souls amazing grace <eos> every time <eos> every time you touch my face <eos> ill try to love you tenderly <eos> ill try to love you tenderly <eos> loving you comes easily <eos> ill try to love <eos> i try to love you tenderly <eos> take my hand and dont look back <eos> take my hand and dont look back <eos> well take a ride on the railroad track <eos> take my hand <eos> take my hand and dont look back <eos> well sing a song to the cities beat <eos> where the white sheets hang above the dusty streets <eos> the songs we sing sound so sweet <eos> well sing a song to the citys beat <eos> i can tell that you need your sleep <eos> i can tell that you need your sleep <eos> weve been running round these lonely street <eos> i can tell <eos> i can tell that you need your sleep <eos> how much time do you think we got <eos> how much time do you think we got <eos> we had a little now we hope for lots <eos> tell me <eos> how much time do you think we got <eos> lets raise a glass to the ones we love <eos> raise

walls will stand for years <eos> some wash away with tears <eos> some walls are lined with gold <eos> some hearts stay safe and cold <eos> some walls are made of doubt <eos> holding in and keeping out <eos> chorus <eos> if theres any hope for love at all <eos> some walls must fall <eos> some walls are built on pride <eos> some keep a child inside <eos> some walls are made in fear <eos> that love let go will disappear <eos> chorus <eos> how will you ever know what might be found <eos> until you let the walls come tumbling down <eos> chorus bonny bonny was my seat in the red rosy yard <eos> and bonny was my ship in the town of ballynagard <eos> shade and shelter was for me till i began to fail <eos> you all may guess now my distress lies near the nightingale <eos> grief and woe that i must go to fight for englands king <eos> i neither know his friend or foe and wars a cruel thing <eos> the nightingale is near at hand my time at home is brief <eos> and careys steams and mountain land i part with bitter grief <eos> no more ill walk the golden hills with nancy by my side <eos> or dream along the sun bright rills or view my land with pride <eos> we sail away at dawn of day the sails are ready set <eos> when old benmore i see no more ill sigh with deep regret <eos> now all must change and i must range across the ocean wide <eos> our ship she may in biscays bay lie low beneath the tide <eos> if i should fall by cannon ball or sink beneath the sea <eos> good people all a tear let fall and mourn for mine and me standing by my christmas tree <eos> wishing you were here with me <eos> the snow is falling everywhere <eos> but its not okay that youre not there <eos> lonely footprints in the snow <eos> and where they lead nobody knows <eos> i feel the frost beneath my feet <eos>

night i dreamed it never was so far <eos> to reach the shore of safety and redemption <eos> and a gaze upon the bright morning star <eos> i dreamed i was by friends all put abandoned <eos> i dreamed i was alone but for my scars <eos> and blinded by the tears that fell like water <eos> no more to see the bright morning star <eos> the streets of dreams never looked this lonely <eos> the streets of dreams never felt this hard <eos> and i heard my voice barely of a whisper <eos> as the clouds denied the bright morning star <eos> sometimes this life is no more than a moment <eos> and sometimes this light is lost unto the dark <eos> but courage hears the sound of dawn approaching <eos> and each our own bright morning star <eos> i woke to find every window open <eos> i woke to find the heavy door jar <eos> and i walked outside and stood upon the hilltop <eos> and gazed one small bright morning star <eos> i walked outside and every bird was singing <eos> as i found again my bright morning

blinded i can see <eos> smoke is rising from the fire that burns <eos> sky is purple and the water rise <eos> people talking quiet as they start to learn <eos> to see with their own eyes <eos> their lives and our lives different as any other <eos> my pain is your pain tell me do you want to go under <eos> you will feel it when the night starts burning <eos> feet shuffle on that day <eos> when were going to find what were going to be fighting <eos> come again <eos> you will feel it when the night starts burning <eos> makes you want to stay <eos> light will fill your eyes <eos> we got the seeds of life <eos> hidden in our hands <eos> blinded by ourselves though cant you see that <eos> weve got the seeds of life do you understand <eos> and hear the calling <eos> youve got love though <eos> love we got inside <eos> its time to open our eyes and really wonder <eos> and really wonder <eos> if its enough for all we need in life <eos> can you take me back can you take me back layin up in bed all night with you again <eos> yeah we hide from the next day <eos> cos we know we know that i <eos> in the end i really cant stay <eos> pleasure pain are both the same and love is just a losing game <eos> wanting to give it all but fraid to lose it if it falls apart <eos> we hold each other but we hold back <eos> yeah we enclose each other then we step back <eos> i can see it in your

we both know <eos> bright eyes <eos> shimmering in the taillights <eos> we hit the brakes and collide <eos> we both know <eos> its a long haul <eos> from both sides of the sea <eos> but we both know <eos> a steep fall <eos> hanging by a thread oh <eos> but we both know <eos> we both know <eos> steep fall <eos> hanging by a thread oh <eos> all the lies that we sold <eos> we both know <eos> free fall <eos> all the lies that we sold <eos> watch em from afar oh <eos> we both know <eos> we both know <eos> we both know <eos> we both know <eos> we both know no lights <eos> on the radar screen

sylvia plath i bow my head <eos> stoning pearls <eos> like enamel marbles <eos> becoming unstrung <eos> one by one <eos> like verdigris wounds <eos> of my boldness necklace <eos> sunk wreckages <eos> the only hold of instants <eos> till the core bit <eos> these are my verdigris wounds oh mio signore io gli dissi"signore <eos> no per la dea bendata <eos> io non ho gusto di grandezze mio signore <eos> di morir mi punge vaghezza <eos> veder nella rugiada di loto il fiore <eos> lungo lacheronte" <eos> oh mio signor si fece freddo il cuore <eos> cedere dali stremate <eos> filava melis al fuso un filo fine <eos> filava melis al fuso un filo fine <eos> oh mio signore io gli dissi"signore <eos> no per la dea bendata <eos> io non ho gusto di grandezze mio signore <eos> di morir mi punge vaghezza <eos> veder nella rugiada di loto il fiore <eos> lungo lacheronte" <eos> non cera ballo non festa mio signore <eos> non ceran neppure boschi <eos> filava melis al fuso un filo fine <eos> filava melis al fuso un filo fine the universal had your presence <eos> splitting the archetype <eos> into a mask <eos> with your own features <eos> it was me <eos> who was erecting the statue <eos> of epidermic

noci besane <eos> zar njene usne zivog da me sahrane <eos> ako su tvoje usne melem nudile <eos> sto su mi dusu trovale i ubile <eos> o noci moje crne noci besane <eos> zar njene usne zivog da me sahrane <eos> kad bi me iz pakla pozvala <eos> ja bih dosao <eos> vrata raja da mi zatvoris <eos> ja bih prosao <eos> samo je srce jos svedok <eos> da sam ziv ove noci <eos> u meni lako ubila si sve

well its quite down here x <eos> down here <eos> entire world under the street <eos> soiled air you can not breathe <eos> lines and lines of shoeless theives <eos> onehundred beds under one sheet <eos> well its hard down here x <eos> down here <eos> mmmmmh <eos> mmmmmh <eos> mmmmmh <eos> white mosaic hairdos <eos> with sign posts overgrown <eos> destination unknown <eos> was londons rose with

top <eos> take us back up <eos> take us back up to the top <eos> take us back up take in a breath <eos> and treasure the light <eos> dont let them see you move <eos> youve got nothing to prove <eos> hold out your arms <eos> and place them in mine <eos> dont let me feel you shake <eos> in fear they find mistake <eos> silence this song <eos> with bugles that play <eos> you need to hear the call <eos> they wishing you to fall <eos> dont let them see you fail <eos> i will not let you fail <eos> i will not let you fail <eos> i will not let <eos> you fail through blades of grass <eos> i saw you stand <eos> and lose balance <eos> but i could not reach your hand <eos> so i sat and waited <eos> and held my mouth <eos> so i could love you without distracting sounds <eos> i id sail down the river nile <eos> just to keep you alive and well <eos> im lost within <eos> my world of sins <eos> with all you touch <eos> but i can not confess <eos> i id sail down the river nile <eos> but the truth couldnt help you now <eos> couldnt help you <eos> couldnt help you now <eos> couldnt help you <eos> couldnt help you now <eos> couldnt help you <eos> couldnt help you now its been countless days since last we wrote <eos> and countless more since last we spoke <eos> but now thats all that remains <eos> the letters that make up your name <eos> and i used to see every line that crossed <eos> your face but now the lines are lost <eos> in stories told and ive grown old <eos> let me read again the letters that you sent <eos> caroline wrote to me <eos> every day of that july <eos> but now thats all i have left <eos> just thirtyone pages of caroline <eos> i waited all that time for you <eos> to write me back to write a new <eos> verse of our love but it never came <eos> just hoped my caroline was safe <eos> and just as i had always feared <eos> your precious words they disappeared <eos> in to my mind as i went blind <eos> let me read again the letters that you sent <eos> caroline wrote to me <eos> every day of that july <eos> but now thats all i have left <eos> just thirtyone pages of caroline i saw you holding hands with the moon <eos> scented fingers fill the room <eos> its making me thin <eos> all this pulling you in <eos> it tears me apart <eos> and im back to the start <eos> i cant rest <eos> i cant rest <eos> i cant rest <eos> knowing this <eos> i cant rest <eos> mouths that open up to me <eos> speak with pearls of wisdom teeth <eos> the seraphin know your sins <eos> and they impart to my human heart <eos> i am blessed <eos> in this unrest <eos> i am blessed <eos> in this unrest <eos> oh <eos> i saw you holding hands with the moon <eos> left feeling empty <eos> my cold and barren womb <eos> that makes me thin <eos> with every spin as <eos> we revolve <eos> theres no resolve <eos> i am blessed <eos> in this unrest <eos> i am blessed <eos> in this unrest <eos> in unrest child of mine you are the wildest wind <eos> and the dearest dream i will ever know <eos> loves lasting light shines out from deep within <eos> this fathers heart as i watch you grow <eos> child of mine you are the break of dawn <eos> and the brightest star i will ever know <eos> loves lasting light comes shining on and on <eos> from this mothers heart as i watch you grow <eos> there is a road and that road is all your own <eos> but we are here you need not walk alone <eos> to face not fear each coming new unknown <eos> is the way to lift your wings <eos> child of mine you are the sweetest song <eos> and the greatest gift i will ever know <eos> child of mine where spirits fly above <eos> there is but one that belongs to you <eos> so let it grow and it will thrive on love <eos> for it is love that sees us through i was born in the path of the winter wind <eos> i was raised where the mountains are old <eos> their springtime waters came dancing down <eos> and i remember the tales they told <eos> the whistling ways of my younger days <eos> too quickly have faded on by <eos> but all of their memories linger on <eos> like the light in a fading sky <eos> river take me along in your sunshine sing me a song <eos> ever moving and winding and free <eos> you rolling old river you changing old river <eos> lets you and me river run down to the sea <eos> ive been to the city and back again <eos> ive been moved by some things that ive learned <eos> met a lot of good people and ive called them friends <eos> felt the change when the seasons turned <eos> ive heard all the songs that the children sing <eos> and listened to loves melodies <eos> ive felt my own music within me rise <eos> like the wind in the autumn trees <eos> river take me along in your sunshine sing me a song <eos> ever moving and winding and free <eos> you rolling old river you changing old river <eos> lets you and me river run down to the sea <eos> someday when the flowers are blooming still <eos> someday when the grass is still green <eos> my rolling waters will round the bend <eos> and flow into the open sea <eos> so heres to the rainbow thats followed me here <eos> and heres to the friends that i know <eos> and heres to the song thats within me now <eos> i will sing it wherever i go <eos> river

critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now <eos> all gods critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now <eos> listen to the bass its the one on the bottom <eos> where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus <eos> moans and groans with a big tdo <eos> and the old cow just goes moo <eos> the dogs and the cats they take up the middle <eos> while the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles <eos> the donkey brays and the pony neighs <eos> and the old coyote howls <eos> all gods critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now <eos> listen to the top where the little birds sing <eos> on the melodies with the high notes ringing <eos> the hoot owl hollers over everything <eos> and the jaybird disagrees <eos> singin in the night time singing in the day <eos> the little duck quacks then hes on his way <eos> the possum aint got much to say <eos> and the porcupine talks to himself <eos> all gods critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now <eos> its a simple song of living sung everywhere <eos> by the ox and the fox and the grizzly gear <eos> the grumpy alligator the the hawk above <eos> the sly raccoon and the turtle dove <eos> all gods critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now <eos> all gods critters got a place in the choir <eos> some sing low some sing higher <eos> some sing out loud on the telephone wires <eos> and some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now am i alone out on this walk <eos> or am i solely just a passenger <eos> lover of mine ive come to talk <eos> is there a space in you to share a thought <eos> in that heart you have is it only us <eos> is your heart shared is there another inside <eos> deep in the dark there i see the love he left behind <eos> theres a road that we must cross <eos> thick with lies yet we defend the thought <eos> a fool would dare to see no wrong <eos> a fool was i to run the auburn light <eos> to finding a home already occupied <eos> is your heart shared is there another inside <eos> deep in the dark there i see the love he left behind calling all the lost souls waiting <eos> for a chance to leave their failings <eos> lightning in the fields of gold <eos> as it strikes a memory youve never known <eos> hold on to the truth its over your head <eos> whats the use in sorrow if it swallows you again <eos> come out of the dark and into the light <eos> our luck may have come so lets uncover it tonight <eos> harnessed by the current in the rip <eos> roaring with the thunder and the wind <eos> drawn into the myth of deceits voice those soft lips <eos> stuttering you were inin love you were in in love <eos> boiling at the pot the waves went <eos> the struggle is no longer chasing <eos> horizon to the rising sun <eos> get out of the light get out of the light <eos> hold on to the truth its over your head <eos> whats the use in sorrow if it swallows you again <eos> come out of the dark and into the light <eos> our luck may have come so lets uncover it tonight <eos> harnessed by the current in the rip <eos> roaring with the thunder and the wind <eos> drawn into the myth of deceits voice those soft lips <eos> stuttering you were inin love you were in in love <eos> and the only thing that i was told <eos> always say the way youre feeling <eos> if the sea of hope is calm just surrender to your being <eos> i am all around you if the dark is blinding <eos> i am all around you well run forever with the lighting sold out <eos> the mezzanine the stalls and the

<eos> life lovers splitting the worlds <eos> healing the broken and the lame <eos> reach out to me give me your hand <eos> we close the circuits of time <eos> angel ranger stay here by me <eos> guide my transmission of energy <eos> oldest religion simple and clear <eos> pour out a lesson into our dreams can you remember the times <eos> that you have held your head high <eos> and told all your friends of your indian claim <eos> proud good lady and proud good man <eos> some great great grandfather from indian blood came <eos> and you feel in your heart for these ones <eos> oh its written in books and in song <eos> that weve been mistreated and wronged <eos> well over and over i hear those same words <eos> from you good lady and you good man <eos> well listen to me if you care where we stand <eos> and you feel youre a part of these ones <eos> when a war between nations is lost <eos> the loser we know pays the cost <eos> but even when germany fell to your hands <eos> consider dear lady consider dear man <eos> you left them their pride and you left them their land <eos> and what have you done to these ones <eos> has a change come about my dear man <eos> or are you still taking our lands <eos> a treaty forever your senators sign <eos> they do dear lady they do dear man <eos> and the treaties are broken again and again <eos> and what will you do for these ones god is alive magic is afoot <eos> god is alive magic is afoot <eos> god is afoot magic is alive <eos> alive is afoot <eos> magic never died <eos> god never sickened <eos> many poor men lied <eos> many sick men lied <eos> magic never weakened <eos> magic never hid <eos> magic always ruled <eos> god is afoot <eos> god never died <eos> god was ruler <eos> though his funeral lengthened <eos> though his mourners thickened <eos> magic never fled <eos> though his shrouds were hoisted <eos> the naked god did live <eos> though his words were twisted <eos> the naked magic thrived <eos> though his death was published <eos> round and round the world <eos> the heart did not believe <eos> many hurt men wondered <eos> many struck men bled <eos> magic never faltered <eos> magic always led <eos> many stones were rolled <eos> but god would not lie down <eos> many wild men lied <eos> many fat men listened <eos> though they offered stones <eos> magic still was fed <eos> though they locked their coffers <eos> god was always served <eos> magic is afoot god rules <eos> alive is afoot alive is in command <eos> many weak men hungered <eos> many strong men thrived <eos> though they boasted solitude <eos> god was at their side <eos> nor the dreamer in his cell <eos> nor the captain on the hill <eos> magic is alive <eos> though his death was pardoned <eos> round and round the world <eos> the heart did not believe <eos> though laws were carved in marble <eos> they could not shelter men <eos> though altars built in parliaments <eos> they could not order men <eos> police arrested magic <eos> and magic went with them <eos> for magic loves the hungry <eos> but magic would not tarry <eos> it moves from arm to arm <eos> it would not stay with them <eos> magic is afoot <eos> it cannot come to harm <eos> it rests in an empty palm <eos> it spawns in an empty mind <eos> but magic is no instrument <eos> magic is the end <eos> many men drove magic <eos> but magic stayed behind <eos> many strong men lied <eos> they only passed through magic <eos> and out the other side <eos> many weak men lied <eos> they came to god in secret <eos> and though they left him nourished <eos> they would not say who healed <eos> though mountains danced before them <eos> they said that god was dead <eos> though his shrouds were hoisted <eos> the naked god did live <eos> this i mean to whisper to my mind <eos> this i mean to laugh with in my mind <eos> this i mean my mind to serve til <eos> service is but magic <eos> moving through the world <eos> and mind itself is magic <eos> coursing through the flesh <eos> and flesh itself is magic <eos> dancing on a clock <eos> and time itself the magic length of god yesterday a child came out to wonder <eos> caught a dragonfly inside a jar <eos> fearful when the sky was full of thunder <eos> and tearful at the falling of a star <eos> then the child moved ten times round the seasons <eos> skated over ten clear frozen streams <eos> words like when youre older must appease him <eos> and promises of someday make his dreams <eos> and the seasons they go round and round <eos> and the painted ponies go up and down <eos> were captive on the carousel of time <eos> we cant return we can only look behind <eos> from where we came <eos> and go round and round and round <eos> in the circle game <eos> sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now <eos> cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town <eos> and they tell him <eos> take your time it wont be long now <eos> till you drag your feet to slow the circles down <eos> and the seasons they go round and round <eos> and the painted ponies go up and down <eos> were captive on the carousel of time <eos> we cant return we can only look behind <eos> from where we came <eos> and go round and round and round <eos> in the circle game <eos> so the years spin by and now the boy is twenty <eos> though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true <eos> therell be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty <eos> before the last revolving year is through <eos> and the seasons they go round and round <eos> and the painted ponies go up and down <eos> were captive on the carousel of time <eos> we cant return we can only look behind <eos> from where we came <eos> and go round and round and round <eos> in the circle game im a rambler and a rover <eos> and a wanderer it seems <eos> ive traveled all over <eos> chasing

sharp and clear <eos> and the air was biting <eos> softly swiftly down the road <eos> never made a sound <eos> someone came from far away <eos> as i looked into his eyes <eos> no reflections came <eos> and i gave him bedding <eos> oh my little rosary <eos> how i miss you so <eos> never used you very well <eos> now i never will <eos> i am farther from you now <eos> than the two ends of eternity <eos> now i do his bidding little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x <eos> merry christmas jingle bells <eos> christ is born and the devils in hell <eos> hearts they shrink pockets swell <eos> everybody know and nobody tell <eos> little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x <eos> oh the sins of caesars men <eos> cry the pious citizens <eos> who petty thieve the s <eos> and the big wheels turn around and around <eos> little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x <eos> blame the angels blame the fates <eos> blame the jews or your sister kate <eos> teach your children how to hate <eos> and the big wheels turn around and around <eos> little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x <eos> turn your back on weeds youve hoed <eos> silly sinful seeds youve sowed <eos> add your straw to the camels load <eos> pray like hell when your world explode <eos> little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x <eos> swing your girl fiddler say <eos> later on the piper pay <eos> do see do swing and sway <eos> dead will dance on judgement day <eos> little wheels spin and spin big wheels turn around around x ive damn near walked this world around <eos> another city another town <eos> another friend to say goodbye <eos> and another time to sit and cry <eos> oh its many a mile <eos> i have spent on this road <eos> its many a mile i have gone <eos> well there was one he knew me best <eos> you know he gave my poor heart rest <eos> he was my world my heart my dear <eos> and now hes gone to god knows where <eos> oh its many a mile <eos> i have spent on this road <eos> its many a mile i have gone <eos> ive seen your towns theyre all the same <eos> the only difference is in a name <eos> and the only home i ever known <eos> was a suitcase and the open road <eos> oh its many a mile <eos> i have spent on this road <eos> its many a mile i have gone <eos> so ill fill my glass up to the brim <eos> and through my glass my world looks dim <eos> i know outside theres love somewhere <eos> maybe my rambling will take me there <eos> oh its many a mile <eos> i have spent on this road <eos> its many a mile i have gone <eos> and its many a mile <eos> i have spent on this road <eos> its many a mile i will go we are drifting and rolling along the road <eos> tryin to bear my heavy load <eos> like a log thats been passed on the side <eos> im so heavy and so tired <eos> and i know me a few men in my time <eos> none of them worth a lousy dime <eos> and they make me work like a doggone slave <eos> wont be happy till im in my grave <eos> and ive been drifting and rolling along the road <eos> tryin to bear my heavy load <eos> and like a log thats been passed on the side <eos> im so heavy and so tired <eos> my world you dont took it and torn it in two <eos> whod ever thought it of a boy like you <eos> it looked hot i thought it was a sugar and spice <eos> salty water turned to ice every little baby thats ever been born <eos> been spanked and made to cry <eos> every young woman thats ever been loved <eos> been shaken and made to sigh <eos> every young woman thats ever been loved <eos> has told told me true <eos> take his heart and run away as he would do to you <eos> every young man ive ever seen <eos> been mean as he could be <eos> every last one ive loved <eos> and run as he would do to me <eos> take it from me that a man can be more trouble <eos> than youll ever know <eos> hell love you some and when hes done <eos> hell laugh and let you go <eos> so they told me and they told me little else <eos> but i tell you to better find out for yourself <eos> handsome stride and shoulders wide disguise a heart of stone <eos> lovers wiles and tender smiles are better left alone <eos> with his head hung low and his shoulders down <eos> and a tear in the bottom of his shoe <eos> hell beg and tease and vow on his knees <eos> and then betray you true <eos> hell say im tired im broke im sick i love you while he cries <eos> hell say im sorry through his tears and all the time he lies <eos> shudder and sulk when hes at his best <eos> try one if you will <eos> you can have mine and all the rest you know ive had my fill <eos> so they told me and they told me little else <eos> but i tell you to better find out for yourself now that your big eyes have finally opened <eos> now that youre wondering how must they feel <eos> meaning them that youve chased across americas movie screens <eos> now that youre wondering "how can it be real" <eos> that the ones youve called colourful noble and proud <eos> in your school propaganda <eos> they starve in their splendor <eos> youve asked for my comment i simply will render <eos> my country tis of thy people youre dying <eos> now that the longhouses breed superstition <eos> you force us to send our toddlers away <eos> to your schools where theyre taught to despise their traditions <eos> forbid them their languages then further say <eos> that american history really began <eos> when columbus set sail out of europe then stress <eos> that the nation of leeches that conquered this land <eos> are the biggest and bravest and boldest and best <eos> and yet where in your history books is the tale <eos> of the genocide basic to this countrys birth <eos> of the preachers who lied how the bill of rights failed <eos> how a nation of patriots returned to their earth <eos> and where will it tell of the liberty bell <eos> as it rang with a thud <eos> oer kinzua mud <eos> and of brave uncle sam in alaska this year <eos> my country tis of thy people youre dying <eos> hear how the bargain was made for the west <eos> with her shivering children in zero degrees <eos> blankets for your land so the treaties attest <eos> oh well blankets for land is a bargain indeed <eos> and the blankets were those uncle sam had collected <eos> from smallpoxdiseased dying soldiers that day <eos> and the tribes were wiped out and the history books censored <eos> a hundred years of your statesmen have felt its better this way <eos> and yet a few of the conquered have somehow survived <eos> their blood runs the redder though genes have paled <eos> from the grand canyons caverns to craven sad hills <eos> the wounded the losers the robbed sing their tale <eos> from los angeles county to upstate new york <eos> the white nation fattens while others grow lean <eos> oh the tricked and evicted they know what i mean <eos> my country tis of thy people youre dying <eos> the past it just crumbled the future just threatens <eos> our life blood shut up in your chemical tanks <eos> and now here you come bill of sale in your hands <eos> and surprise in your eyes that were lacking in thanks <eos> for the blessings of civilization youve brought us <eos> the lessons youve taught us the ruin youve wrought us <eos> oh see what our trust in americas brought us <eos> my country tis of thy people youre dying <eos> now that the pride of the sires receives charity <eos> now that were harmless and safe behind laws <eos> now that my lifes to be known as yourheritage <eos> now that even the graves have been robbed <eos> now that our own chosen way is a novelty <eos> hands on our hearts we salute you your victory <eos> choke on your blue white and scarlet hypocrisy <eos> pitying the blindness that youve never seen <eos> that the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory <eos> they were never no more than carrion crows <eos> pushed the wrens from their nest stole their eggs changed their story <eos> the mockingbird sings it its all that he knows <eos> "ah what can i do" say a powerless few <eos> with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye <eos> cant you see that their povertys profiting you <eos> my country tis of thy people youre dying the rain is falling lightly on the buildings and the cars <eos> ive said goodbye to city friends department stores and bars <eos> the lights of town are at my back my heart is full of stars <eos> and im gonna be a country girl again <eos> oh yes im gonna be a country girl again <eos> with an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen <eos> i tell you all the lights on

love die <eos> if i could find that lonely street <eos> where dim lights bring forgetfulness <eos> where broken dreams and memories meet <eos> wheres this place called lonely street <eos> wheres this place called lonely street as we sat on the front porch of that old gray house <eos> where i was born and raised <eos> staring at the dusty fields <eos> where my daddy worked hard everyday <eos> i think it kinda hurt him when i said <eos> daddy theres a lot that i dont know <eos> but dont you ever dream <eos> about a life where corn dont grow" <eos> he just sat there silent <eos> staring at his favorite coffee cup <eos> i saw a storm of mixed emotions <eos> in his eyes when he looked up <eos> he said son i know at your age <eos> it seems like this old world is turnin slow <eos> and you think youll find the answer to it all <eos> where corn dont grow" <eos> hard times are real <eos> theres dusty fields no matter where you go <eos> you may change your mind <eos> cause the weeds are high where corn dont grow <eos> i remember feeling guilty <eos> when daddy turned and walked back in the house <eos> i was only back then but i thought <eos> that i knew more than i know now <eos> i cant say he didnt warn me <eos> this city lifes a hard roe to hoe <eos> aint it funny how a dream <eos> can turn around where corn dont grow <eos> hard times are real <eos> theres dusty fields no matter where you go <eos> and you may change your mind <eos> cause the weeds are high where corn dont grow <eos> you may change your mind <eos> cause the weeds are high where corn dont grow verse <eos>

publicans anxious for the quota to come <eos> theres a faraway look on the face of the bum <eos> the maids gone all cranky and the cooks acting queer <eos> what a terrible place is a pub with no beer <eos> the stock man rides up with his dry dusty throat <eos> he breasts up till the bar pulls a wad from his coat <eos> but the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer <eos> when the barman says suddenly "the pubs got no beer" <eos> theres a dog on the verandah for his master he waits <eos> but the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates <eos> he hurries for cover and he cringes in fear <eos> its no place for a dog round a pub with no beer <eos> old billy the blacksmith the first time in his life <eos> has gone home cold sober to his darling wife <eos> he walks in the kitchen she

call <eos> but theres nothin so lonesome so dull or so drear <eos> than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer as down the glen came mcalpines men <eos> with their shovels slung behind them <eos>

sight <eos> me body is all black and blue me face a deathly gray <eos> and i write this note to say why paddys not at work today <eos> while working on the fourteenth floor some bricks i had to clear <eos> now to throw them down from such a height was not a good idea <eos> the foreman wasnt very pleased he being an awkward sod <eos> he said id have to carry them down the ladders in me hod <eos> now clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow <eos> so i hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below <eos> but in me haste to do the job i was too blind to see <eos> that a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me <eos> so when i untied the rope the barrel fell like lead <eos> and clinging tightly to the rope i started up instead <eos> while i shot up like a rocket to my dismay i found <eos> that halfway up i met the bloody barrel coming down <eos> well the barrel broke my shoulders as to the ground it sped <eos> and when i reached the top i banged the pulley with me head <eos> well i clung on tight though numb and shock from this almighty blow <eos> and the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below <eos> now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor <eos> i then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more <eos> still clinging tightly to the rope i sped towards the ground <eos> and i landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered round <eos> while i lay their groaning on the ground i thought i passed the worst <eos> when the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst <eos> well a shower of bricks rained down on me i hadnt got a hope <eos> as i lay there moaning on the ground i let go of the bloody rope <eos> the barrel then being heavier it started down once more <eos> and landed right across me as i lay across the floor <eos> well it broke three ribs and my left arm and i can only say <eos> that i hope youll understand why paddys not at work today farewell to princes landing stage river mersey fare thee well <eos> i am bound for california a place i know right well <eos> so fare thee well my own true love <eos> when i return united we will be <eos> its not the leaving of liverpool

desire <eos> my heart is heavy with the grief of mothers <eos> my eyes have been wet with the tears of children <eos> i have yearned with old wistful men <eos> and laughed and cursed with young men <eos> their shame is my shame and i have reddened for it <eos> reddened for that they have served they who should be free <eos> reddened for that they have gone in want while others have been full <eos> reddened for that they have walked in fear of lawyers and their jailors <eos> with their writs of summons and their handcuffs <eos> men mean and cruel <eos> i could have borne stripes on my body <eos> rather than this shame of my people <eos> and now i speak being full of vision <eos> i speak to my people and i speak in my peoples name to <eos> the masters of my people <eos> i say to my people that they are holy <eos> that they are august despite their chains <eos> that they are greater than those that hold them <eos> and stronger and purer <eos> that they have but need of courage and to call on the name of their god <eos> god the unforgetting the dear god who loves the people <eos> for whom he died naked suffering shame <eos> and i say to my peoples masters beware <eos> beware of the thing that is coming beware of the risen people <eos> who shall take what ye would not give <eos> did ye think to conquer the people or that law is stronger than life <eos> and than mens desire to be free <eos> we will try it out with you ye that have harried and held <eos> ye that have bullied and bribed <eos> tyrants hypocrites liars a hungry feeling <eos> came oer me stealing <eos> all the mice were squealing <eos> in my prison cell <eos> and the auld triangle went jinglejangle <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal <eos> to begin the morning <eos> the screw was bawling <eos> "get up ya bowsie <eos> and clean up your cell" <eos> and the auld triangle went jinglejangle <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal <eos> on a fine spring evening <eos> the loike lay dreaming <eos> and the seagulls squeeling <eos> high above the wall <eos> oh the day was dying <eos> and the wind was sighing <eos> as i lay there crying <eos> in my prison cell <eos> and the auld triangle went jinglejangle <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal <eos> oh the screw was peeping <eos> and the loike was sleeping <eos> as he lay there weeping <eos> for his poor gal <eos> and the auld triangle went jinglejangle <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal <eos> up in the female prison <eos> there are seventy five women <eos> and among them <eos> i wish i did dwell <eos> and the auld triangle went jinglejangle <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal <eos> all along the banks of the royal canal make way for the molly maguires <eos> theyre drinkers theyre liars but theyre

day rue <eos> i saw the danger yet i passed <eos> along the enchanted way <eos> and i said let grief be a falling leaf <eos> at the dawning of the day <eos> on grafton street in november <eos> we tripped lightly along the ledge <eos> of a deep ravine where can be seen <eos> the worth of passions pledged <eos> the queen of hearts still making tarts <eos> and i not making hay <eos> oh i loved too much and by such by such <eos> is happiness thrown away <eos> i gave her gifts of the mind <eos> i gave her the secret sign <eos> thats known to the artists who have known <eos> the true gods of sound and stone <eos> and word and tint i did not stint <eos> for i gave her poems to say <eos> with her own name there and her own dark hair <eos> like clouds over fields of may <eos> on a quiet street where old ghosts meet <eos> i see her walking now <eos> away from me so hurriedly <eos> my reason must allow <eos> that i had loved not as i should <eos> a creature made of clay <eos> when the angel woos the clay <eos> hell lose his wings at dawn of day i danced in the morning <eos> when the world was begun <eos> and i danced in the moon <eos> and the stars and the sun <eos> and i came down from heaven <eos> and i danced on the earth <eos> at bethlehem <eos> i had my birth <eos> dance then wherever you may be <eos> i am the lord of the dance said he <eos> and ill lead you all wherever you may be <eos> and ill lead you all in the dance said he <eos> i danced for the scribe <eos> and the pharisee <eos> but they would not dance <eos> and they wouldnt follow me <eos> i danced for the fishermen <eos> for james and john <eos> they came with me <eos> and the dance went on <eos> dance then wherever you may be <eos> i am the lord of the dance said he <eos> and ill lead you all wherever you may be <eos> and ill lead you all in the dance said he <eos> i danced on the sabbath <eos> and i cured the lame <eos> the holy people <eos> said it was a shame <eos> they whipped and they stripped <eos> and they hung me on high <eos> and they left me there <eos> on a cross to die <eos> dance then wherever you may be <eos> i am the lord of the dance said he <eos> and ill lead you all wherever you may be <eos> and ill lead you all in the dance said he <eos> i danced on a friday <eos> when the sky turned black <eos> its hard to dance <eos> with the devil on your back <eos> they buried my body <eos> and they thought id gone <eos> but i am the dance <eos> and i still go on <eos> dance then wherever you may be <eos> i am the lord of the dance said he <eos> and ill lead you all wherever you may be <eos> and ill lead you all in the dance said he <eos> they cut me down <eos> and i leapt up high <eos> i am the life <eos> thatll never never die <eos> ill live in you <eos> if youll live in me <eos> i am the lord <eos> of the dance said he twas down the glen one easter morn <eos> to a city fair rode i <eos> when armed line of marching men <eos> in squadrons passed me by <eos> no pipes did hum no battle drum <eos> did sound its loud tattoo <eos> but the angelus bell oer the liffeys swell <eos> rang out in the foggy dew <eos> right proudly high over dublin town <eos> they hung out a flag of war <eos> twas better to die neath an irish sky <eos> than at suvla or sud el bar <eos> and from the plains of royal meath <eos> strong men came hurrying through <eos> while brittanias huns with their great big guns <eos> sailed in through the foggy dew <eos> twas england bade our wild geese go <eos> that small nations might be free <eos> but their lonely graves are by suvlas waves <eos> on the fringe of the gray north sea <eos> but had they died by pearses side <eos> or fought with cathal brugha <eos> their names wed keep where the fenians sleep <eos> neath the shroud of the foggy dew <eos> the bravest fell and the solemn bell <eos> rang mournfully and clear <eos> for those who died that watertide <eos> in the springing of the year <eos> and the world did gaze with deep amaze <eos> at those fearless men but few <eos> who bore the fight that freedoms light <eos> might shine through the foggy dew by a lonely prison wall <eos> i heard a young girl calling <eos> michael they have taken you away <eos> for you stole trevelyans corn <eos> so the young might see the morn <eos> now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay <eos> chorus <eos> low lie the fields of athenry <eos> where once we watched the small free birds fly <eos> our love was on the wing <eos> we had dreams and songs to sing <eos> its so lonely round the fields of athenry <eos> by a lonely prison wall <eos> i heard a young man calling <eos> nothing matters mary when youre free <eos> against the famine and the crown <eos> i rebelled they cut me down <eos> now you must raise our child with dignity <eos> chorus <eos> by a lonely harbour wall <eos> she watched the last star falling <eos> as the prison ship sailed out against the sky <eos> for she lived in hope and pray <eos> for her love in botany bay <eos> its so lonely round the fields of athenry <eos> chorus while in the merry month of may from me home i started <eos> left the girls of tuam so sad and broken hearted <eos> saluted father dear

the factory wall <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> clouds are drifting across the moon <eos> cats are prowling on their beat <eos> springs a girl from the streets at night <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> i heard a siren from the docks <eos> saw a train set the night on fire <eos> smelled the spring on the smoky wind <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> im going to make me a good sharp axe <eos> shining steel tempered in the fire <eos> ill chop you down like an old dead tree <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> i met my love by the gas works wall <eos> dreamed a dream by the old canal <eos> i kissed my girl by the factory wall <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town <eos> dirty old town in my memory i will always see <eos> the town that i have loved so well <eos> where our school played ball by the gasyard wall <eos> and we laughed through the smoke and the smell <eos> going home in the rain running up the dark lane <eos> past the jail and down behind the fountain <eos> those were happy days in so many many ways <eos> in the town i loved so well <eos> in the early morning the shirtfactory horn <eos> called women from craigeen the moor and the bog <eos> while the man on the dole played the mothers role <eos> fed the children and then trained the dogs <eos> and when times got tough there was just about enough <eos> but they saw it through without complaining <eos> for deep inside was a burning pride <eos> for the town i loved so well <eos> there was music there in the derry air <eos> like a language that we all could understand <eos> i remember the day when i earned my first pay <eos> as i played in the small pickup band <eos> there i spent my youth and to tell you the truth <eos> i was sad to leave it all behind me <eos> for id learned bout life and ive found me a wife <eos> in the town i loved so well <eos> but when i returned how my eyes have burned <eos> to see how a town could be brought ti its knees <eos> by the armored cars and the bombedout bars <eos> and the gas that hangs on to every breeze <eos> now the armys installed by that old gasyard wall <eos> and the damned barbwire gets high and higher <eos> with their tanks and their guns oh my god what have they done <eos> to the town i loved so well i remember the night that he came in from the wintery <eos> cold and damp <eos> a giant of a man in an oilskin coat and a bundle that <eos> told he was a tramp <eos> he stood at the bar and he called a pint then turned <eos> and gazed at the fire <eos> on a night like this to be save and dry is my one and <eos> only desire <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" <eos> then in a voice that was hushed and low he said <eos> "listen ill tell you a tale" <eos> how a man of the sea became a man of the road and never <eos> more will set sail <eos> i fished out of howth and killybegs ardglass and <eos> baltimore <eos> but the cruel sea has beatn me and ill end my days on <eos> the shore <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" <eos> one fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail <eos> from killybegs town <eos> there were five of us from sweet donegal and one from <eos> county down <eos> we were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted <eos> the cost <eos> but i never thought ere that night was done that my <eos> fine friends would all be lost <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" <eos> then the storm it broke and drove the boat to the <eos> rocks about ten miles from shore <eos> as we fought the tide we hoped inside to see our homes <eos> once more <eos> then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us <eos> knew that shed go down <eos> so we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to god <eos> we wouldnt drown <eos> but the ragin sea was risin still as we struck out <eos> for the land <eos> and she fought with all her cruelty to claim that <eos> gallant band <eos> by saint johns point in the early dawn i dragged <eos> myself on the shore <eos> and i cursed the sea for what shed done and vowed to <eos> sail her never more <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" <eos> ever since that night ive been on the road travelin <eos> and tryin to forget <eos> that awful night i lost all my friends i see their <eos> faces yet <eos> and often at night when the sea is high and the rain is <eos> tearing at my skin <eos> i hear the cries of drowning men floating over on the <eos> wind <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" <eos> so heres to those that are dead and gone the friends <eos> that i loved dear <eos> and heres to you and ill bid you adieu sayin <eos> "donegal dannys been here me boys <eos> donegal dannys been here" oh my name it is sam hall chimney sweep chimney sweep

<eos> from the murrays green basin to the dusty outback <eos> i waltzed my matilda all over <eos> then in my country said son <eos> its time to stop rambling theres work to be done <eos> so they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun <eos> and they sent me away to the war <eos> and the band played waltzing matilda <eos> when the ship pulled away from the quay <eos> and amid all the tears flag waving and cheers <eos> we sailed off for gallipoli <eos> it well i remember that terrible day <eos> when our blood stained the sand and the water <eos> and how in that hell they call suvla bay <eos> we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter <eos> johnny turk he was ready he primed himself well <eos> he rained us with bullets and he showered us with shell <eos> and in five minutes flat we were all blown to hell <eos> he nearly blew us back home to australia <eos> and the band played waltzing matilda <eos> when we stopped to bury our slain <eos> well we buried ours and the turks buried theirs <eos> then it started all over again <eos> oh those that were living just tried to survive <eos> in that mad world of blood death and fire <eos> and for ten weary weeks i kept myself alive <eos> while around me the corpses piled higher <eos> then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head <eos> and when i awoke in me hospital bed <eos> and saw what it had done i wished i was dead <eos> i never knew there was worse things than dying <eos> oh no more ill go waltzing matilda <eos> all around the green bush far and near <eos> for to hump tent and pegs a man needs both legs <eos> no more waltzing matilda for me <eos> they collected the wounded the crippled the maimed <eos> and they shipped us back home to australia <eos> the armless the legless the blind and the insane <eos> those proud wounded heroes of suvla <eos> and when the ship pulled into circular quay <eos> i looked at the place where me legs used to be <eos> and thank christ there was no one there waiting for me <eos> to grieve and to mourn and to pity <eos> and the band played waltzing matilda <eos> when they carried us down the gangway <eos> oh nobody cheered they just stood there and stared <eos> then they turned all their faces away <eos> now every april i sit on my porch <eos> and i watch the parade pass before me <eos> i see my old comrades how proudly they march <eos> renewing their dreams of past glories <eos> i see the old men all tired stiff and worn <eos> those weary old heroes of a forgotten war <eos> and the young people ask "what are they marching for" <eos> and i ask myself the same question <eos> and the band plays waltzing matilda <eos> and the old men still answer the call <eos> but year after year their numbers get fewer <eos> someday no one will march there at all <eos> waltzing matilda waltzing matilda <eos> wholl come awaltzing matilda with me <eos> and their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong <eos> so wholl come awaltzing matilda with me in a neat little town they called belfast <eos> apprentice to trade i was bound <eos> and many an hour sweet happiness <eos> have i spent in that neat little town <eos> as sad misfortune came over me <eos> which caused me to stray from the land <eos> far away from me friends and relations <eos> betrayed by the black velvet band <eos> her eyes they shown like diamonds <eos> i thought her the queen of the land <eos> and her hair it hung over her shoulder <eos> tied up with a black velvet band <eos> i took a stroll down broadway <eos> meaning not long for to stay <eos> when who should i meet but this pretty fair maid <eos> come atraipsing along the highway <eos> she was both fair and handsome <eos> her neck it was just like a swan <eos> and her hair it hung over her shoulder <eos> tied up with a black velvet band <eos> her eyes they shown like diamonds <eos> i thought her the queen of the land <eos> and her hair it hung over her shoulder <eos> tied up with a black velvet band <eos> i took a stroll with this pretty fair maid <eos> and a gentleman passing us by <eos> well i knew she meant the doing of him <eos> by the look in her roguish black eye <eos> a gold watch she took from his pocket <eos> and placed it right into my hand <eos> and the very first thing that i said was <eos> bad cess to the black velvet band <eos> her eyes they shown like diamonds <eos> i thought her the queen of the land <eos> and her hair it hung over her shoulder <eos> tied up with a black velvet band <eos> before the judge and the jury <eos> next morning i had to appear <eos> the judge he says to me <eos> "young man youre case it is proven clear <eos> well give you seven years penal servitude <eos> to be spent far away from the land <eos> far away from your friends and relations <eos> betrayed by the black velvet band" <eos> her eyes they shown like diamonds <eos> i thought her the queen of the land <eos> and her hair it hung over her shoulder <eos> tied up with a black velvet band <eos> so

to the world beyond the boys and the girls trying <eos> to keep us calm <eos> we can practice our lines til were deaf and blind <eos> to ourselves to each other where its <eos> fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold <eos> and its warm not hot have we all forgotten that <eos> were getting old <eos> with an arrow and bow and some seeds left to sow <eos> we are staking our claim <eos> on ground so fertile we forget who weve hurt along <eos> the way and reach out for a strange hand <eos> to hold someone strong but not bold enough to <eos> tear down the wall <eos> cause we aint lost enough to find the stars aint <eos> crossed why align them why fall hard <eos> not soft into <eos> fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold <eos> where its warm not hot have we all forgotten that <eos> were getting old you can point and laugh <eos> im sure hes used to that <eos> using faith like an acrobat til the net breaks <eos> he wont get upset <eos> that though weve never met <eos> i know everything hes said cause a friend once told me <eos> hes got hell fire in his eyes <eos> there is madness behind the lies <eos> he would burn us all alive just to prove his point <eos> god save the believer <eos> we mistake for a deceiver <eos> cause it makes us feel better <eos> the time has come and gone <eos> to say whats right and wrong <eos> people like him dont belong cause were all okay <eos> youd better write him off <eos> without a second thought <eos> cause thinking just leads to getting caught in the traps he sets like <eos> who is that on his knees <eos> its that daring young man from the flying trapeze <eos> crying "father father help me please" well good luck pal <eos> cause youre gonna need it <eos> god save the believer <eos> we mistake for a deceiver <eos> cause it makes us feel better <eos> hes got hell fire in his eyes <eos> there is madness behind the lies <eos> he would burn us all alive just to prove his point <eos> god save the believer <eos> we mistake for a deceiver <eos> cause it makes us feel better instrumental im yours if you want me <eos> and im sorry if you do <eos> cause i dont have that much to offer <eos> a girl who knows as much as you <eos> im scared of your body <eos> and im scared of your sould <eos> but id rather be letdown <eos> than let being with you go <eos> im yours if you want me <eos> you can see im not mine anymore <eos> it didnt take much to drive me crazy <eos> i guess i wasnt that sane before <eos> i dont care about my future <eos> and i dont care about your past <eos> those things come from and lead to right now <eos> and they can get the hell out fast i envy the quiet lives that for all i know dont exist <eos> outside of a lazy book that won a pulitzer prize <eos> i picked up cause you said it opened up your eyes <eos> im wired now and will be til i find a person who could eat at the empire grill <eos> whos seen a black mercedes at the textile mill <eos> and spreads the word to all the folks expression hasnt killed <eos> ill follow that car down to boston ask what it wanted in maine <eos> coffee at least for my trouble <eos> ill be a hero if i came back with something to say <eos> too late they wouldnt like me there <eos> and though they might not mind my inquisitive stare <eos> every single one of them is too polite to care <eos> why im enchanted by a way of life in disrepair <eos> im not talking apple pie eating jack and coke drinking <eos> hopeful lie telling anywhere america camera eyes <eos> on a hollywood body that could make you all cry <eos> maybe ill go to the movies a comedy would be ideal <eos> something that probably wont happen <eos> cause this made up town is much too real <eos> i envy the quiet lives that for all i know dont exist <eos> outside of a lazy book that won a pulitzer prize <eos> i picked up cause you said it opened up your eyes oh the heart beats in its cage <eos> well i dont feel better when im fucking around <eos> and i dont write better when im stuck in the ground <eos> so dont teach me a lesson cause ive already learned <eos> yes the sun will be shining and my children will burn <eos> oh the heart beats in its cage <eos> i dont want what you want and i dont feel what you feel <eos> you see im stuck in the city but i belong in a field <eos> oh we gotta laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh <eos> now its three in the morning and

cup is running through my throbbing head because if he had then id be dead <eos> feeling like im feeling now inbetween the skies and clouds where everyones identity is just a picture card they need <eos> i came from california with an appetite for my own myths of music love and what they mean im told its borderline obscene <eos> i tried to write this song before but had no one to write it for my fellow travellers vacant stares leave it up to you to care <eos> i could write a song and have the lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out <eos> looking in at the passengers from the wing im nowhere and youre everything <eos> you came from illinois with a cup of your very own to sip neveron route for very long just there and doing something wrong <eos> or so your friends and parents said but if you hadnt youd be dead what youve been given doesnt scare me <eos> all your sights and sounds prepare me <eos> i could write a song and have the lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out <eos> looking in at the passengers from the wing im nowhere and youre everything <eos> damn this cup bring me a bowl <eos> if i cant saturate my soul <eos> with you and him who drank it first <eos> and last im ready for the worst <eos> its way past two and you want me there <eos> well he needs me here <eos> so you have to share <eos> im crying cause im in love with you <eos> youre crying cause you have no clue <eos> i could write a song and have the lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out <eos> looking in at the passengers from the wing im nowhere and youre everything just for a moment the moment i met her <eos> i lost my breath but my lips whispered she is the one <eos> forgot who i was and who i was fooling <eos> didnt remember she could be my first cue to run <eos> we moved so fast <eos> never thought twice <eos> mind came at last <eos> put us on ice <eos> we stayed in touch but the touch i was wanting from her <eos> came from girls that scared me too little to love <eos> so all of the thoughts i thought i might tell her <eos> turned into songs that until now shes never heard of <eos> i had been taught <eos> love is a vice <eos> took all these thoughts <eos> and i put them on ice <eos> the vice bends and ice tends to melt <eos> one night she asked me how i felt <eos> the next day i woke up lying to myself <eos> i feel fine i feel fine i feel fine <eos> thank god youre here i need you to hear this <eos> so sick of my shit i promise im through tempting fate <eos> i know im in love now you are what love is to me <eos> please tell me this isnt too little too late <eos> oh lets move fast <eos> making up would be nice <eos> im so sorry i put these things on ice <eos> i would like to help you dance right if the sea was whiskey and i was a diving duck <eos> if the sea was whiskey and i was a diving duck <eos> id swim to the bottom and i dont know if id come up <eos> im just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clohtes <eos> im just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clohtes <eos> if things dont get no better then down the road i go <eos> whiskey and beers they dont make me drunk <eos> whiskey and beers they dont make me druink

my fingers one by one <eos> prying off my fingers one by one <eos> ive been praying against you <eos> but the damage has been done <eos> the damage has been done <eos> and it would take a miracle <eos> for her to break my fall <eos> cause she dont care at all anymore <eos> and i dont know why i still do <eos> why im telling you <eos> cause you are the devil <eos> and you can stay away from me <eos> stay away form me <eos> stay away <eos> to hell with my freedom <eos> if it dont come for free <eos> and i know it dont come for free instrumental you wont wake up <eos> youre not dreaming this

faith in our sweet illusion <eos> where every wound heals <eos> so if youre still there <eos> let me tell you this is all real <eos> we felt like angels on the rooftops <eos> looking down at you <eos>

around her head <eos> and she always used to give me some when i was a kid <eos> i told her that i loved her and then i went and hid <eos> ill take you into town and ill show you off <eos> and theres room on your dress for a corsage <eos> and ill open up every door for you <eos> i opened up my almanac and in my head i read <eos> cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can <eos> so i rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the days are long <eos> i sewed up my wrist and sewed the ground with my blood <eos> staind up my clothes pretty good and i turned that dirt to mud <eos> i couldnt help but close my eyes and lay my body down <eos> cause i heard it takes forever to grow a woman from the ground <eos> i bleed for you now and im skinny as a rail <eos> and ill be so obliged to keep you nice and warm and safe <eos> and wont you be so proud of me child <eos> daddy would you sing me a lullaby <eos> take my hand and ill walk you through the fire

think of you every time <eos> because youre my night light <eos> my night light <eos> youre the night light in my dark <eos> take my hand and ill walk you down the aisle <eos> let her look to be the grace behind your smile <eos> find a love that mirrors who we are <eos> keep the wonder in your eyes and shine like stars <eos> and when you feel the tears well up inside <eos> just call my name and ill let you cry <eos> because you are my night light <eos> my night light <eos> youre my night light in my dark <eos> and when you feel the tears well up inside <eos> just call my name <eos> call my

of sight and out of mind <eos> the devils staircase winding high <eos> make it secret make it sudden <eos> and the family garden wakes to frosty ground <eos> in europes towns tonight <eos> they lie awake again to fear the dawn <eos> an endless story of empty glory verse <eos> shes taking her time making up the reasons <eos> to justify all the hurt inside <eos> guess she knows from the smiles and

the shift to overdrive <eos> send a signal that shes hanging all her hopes on the stars <eos> what a pleasant dream just saying <eos> chorus x <eos> mamma never loved her much <eos> and daddy never

new love <eos> the old for her the new that made me think on ireland dearly <eos> while soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley <eos> twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us <eos> but harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us <eos> and so i said "the mountain glen ill seek at morning early <eos> and join the bold united men while soft winds shake the barley" <eos> while sad i kissed away her tears my fond arms round her flinging <eos> the foemans shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing <eos> a bullet pierced my true loves side in lifes young spring so early <eos> and on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley <eos> but blood for blood without remorse ive taken at oulart hollow <eos> and laid my true loves clay cold corpse where i full soon may follow <eos> as round her grave i wander drear noon night and morning early <eos> with breaking heart when eer i hear the wind that shakes the

pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo <eos> but the angelus bell oer the liffey swell rang out in the foggy dew <eos> right proudly high over dublin town they hung out the flag of war <eos> for twas better to die neath an irish sky than at suvla or sud el bar <eos> and from the plains of royal meath strong men came hurrying through <eos> while brittanias sons with their long range guns sailed in by the foggy dew <eos> twas england bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free <eos> but their lonely graves are by suvlas waves on the fringe of the grey north sea <eos> oh had they died by pearses side or fought with valera true <eos> their graves wed keep where the fenians sleep neath the hills of the foggy dew <eos> the bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear <eos> for those who died that easter tide in the springing of the year <eos> and the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true <eos> who bore the fight that freedoms light might shine through the foggy dew ive been a moonshiner for many a year <eos> and ive spent all me money on whiskey and beer <eos> ill go to some hollow and ill set up my still <eos> and ill make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill <eos> chorus <eos> im a rambler im a gambler <eos> im a long way from home <eos> and if you dont like me <eos> you can leave me alone <eos> ill eat when im hungry <eos> and ill drink when im dry <eos> and if moonshine dont kill me <eos> ill live till i die <eos> ill go to some hollow in this country <eos> ten gallons of wash and ill go on a spree <eos> no woman to follow and the world is all mine <eos> i love none so well as i love the moonshine oh list to the lay of a poor irish harper <eos> and scorn not the strains of his old withered hands <eos> but remember his fingers they once could move sharper <eos> to raise up the memory of his dear native land <eos> at a fair or a wake i could twist my shillelagh <eos> or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw <eos> and all the pretty colleens around me assembled <eos> loved their bold phelim brady the bard of armagh <eos> oh how i long to muse on the days of my boyhood <eos> but four score and three years have flitted since then <eos> but they bring sweet reflections as every young joy should <eos> for the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men <eos> and when sergeant death in his cold arms shall embrace me <eos> and lull me to sleep with sweet erin go bragh <eos> by the side of my kathleen my young wife then place me <eos> then forget phelim brady the bard of armagh there was johnny mceldoo and mcgee and me <eos> and a couple of two or three went on the spree one day <eos> we had a bob or two which we knew how to blew <eos> and the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay <eos> we visited mccanns maclamans humpty dans <eos> we then went into swans our stomachs for to pack <eos> we ordered out a feed which indeed we did need <eos> and we finished it with speed but we still felt slack <eos> johnny mceldoo turned red white and blue <eos> as a plate of irish stew he soon put out of sight <eos> he shouted out "encore" with a roar for some more <eos> that hed never felt before such a keen appetite <eos> we ordered eggs and ham bread and jam what a cram <eos> but him we couldnt ram though we tried our level best <eos> for everything we brought cold or hot mattered not <eos> it went down him like a shot and he still stood the test <eos> he swallowed tripe and lard by the yard we got scarred <eos> we thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill <eos> we told him to give oer but he swore he could lower <eos> twice as much again and more before he had his fill <eos> he nearly supped a trough full of broth says mcgragh <eos> "hell devour the tablecloth if you dont hold him in" <eos> when the waiter brought the charge mceldoo felt so large <eos> he began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire <eos> he began to curse and swear tear his hair in despair <eos> to finish the affair called the shop man a liar <eos> the shop man he through out and no doubt he did clout <eos> mceldoo he kicked about like an old football <eos> tattered all his clothes broke his nose i suppose <eos> he would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all <eos> mceldoo began to howl and to growl by my soul <eos> through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head <eos> it struck poor mickey flynn took the skin from his chin <eos> an erection did begin and we all fought and bled <eos> the peelers did arrive man alive four or five <eos> at us they made a dive for us all to march away <eos> we paid for all the mate that we ate stood a trait <eos> and went home to ruminate on the spree that day while goin the road to sweet athy

brennan and in ireland he did dwell <eos> it was on the kilwood mountain he commenced his wild career <eos> and many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear <eos> it was brennan on the moor brennan on the moor <eos> bold brave and undaunted was young brennan on the moor <eos> one day upon the highway as young willie he went down <eos> he met the mayor of cashiell a mile outside of town <eos> the mayor he knew his features and he said young man said he <eos> your name is willie brennan you must come along with me <eos> now brennans wife had gone to town provisions for to buy <eos> and when she saw her willie she commenced to weep and cry <eos> said hand to me that tenpenny as soon as willie spoke <eos> she handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak <eos> now with this loaded blunderbuss the truth i will unfold <eos> he made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold <eos> one hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there <eos> so he with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair <eos> now brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high <eos> with cavalry and infantry to take him they did try <eos> he laughed at them with scorn until at last twas said <eos> by a falsehearted woman he was cruelly betrayed <eos> they hanged brennan at the crossroads in chains he hung and dried <eos> but still they say that in the night some do see him ride <eos> they see him with his blunderbuss all in the midnight chill <eos> along along the kings highway rides willie brennan still as i went home on monday night <eos> as drunk as drunk can be in this

surpassing understanding <eos> like dreams a noble mind composes he blossoms roses <eos> he blossoms roses roses roses roses it was in the morning papers the evening papers too <eos> and i saw it on

was a car crash <eos> out on the highway <eos> and i was the only survivor <eos> i made it out alive <eos> so i fled the wreckage <eos> and called in the accident <eos> with hopes to save the people <eos> still trapped inside <eos> my lucia <eos> ill try and save you <eos> but my attempts did fail <eos> on and on <eos> i see her face and wonder <eos> if i could have saved her <eos> on and on <eos> on and on <eos> shes a ghost to me now <eos> and shes never coming back <eos> there lay the victims <eos> in the back of the ambulance <eos> as if there is something <eos> the doctors can do to save them <eos> so ill cry for mercy <eos> at this horrific day <eos> but no god above <eos> can change the truthfulness <eos> in fate <eos> try to be kind <eos> tell me its fine <eos> but i know that its not <eos> give me some time <eos> lucy ill try <eos> to fix my mistakes ill take your photo in my hand <eos> turn it up and inside out <eos> till theres nothing in between <eos> i wish that could be me <eos> you look fine together <eos> ill run in circles in my head <eos> and base my thoughts on <eos> what youve said <eos> that i could never be like him <eos> i could never play the part <eos> you work well together <eos> if you say that you know me <eos> you never knew me at all <eos> so ill rewrite the story <eos> so they wont ever find me <eos> and well fall together <eos> ill sing again ill sing out loud <eos> ill do my best to please the crowd <eos> my vocals cracked and in repair <eos> the notes are frayed torn to tear <eos> go without me so i hear its cold <eos> up in chicago <eos> but i wouldnt know <eos> you told all your friends <eos> that i was no good <eos> and you banished me from <eos> does it hurt to be alone <eos> you will never know <eos> when youre gone <eos>

her demise <eos> you make it easy to say goodbye for good <eos> you make it easy to say goodbye to you <eos> i never meant to do it <eos> it never should have gone like that <eos> ill never speak for you board a train take it east <eos> find myself again <eos> western winds drove me there <eos> lonely stars take me back home <eos> i chased a dream i read about <eos> in a magazine <eos> and lost myself in the dark <eos> lonely stars take me back home <eos> someday ill find <eos> a truth in this life <eos> till then <eos> when i go leave me be <eos> let me find my peace <eos> coastal town summer skin <eos> lonely stars take me back home told my friends that ive had too much <eos> take me home and to lock me up <eos> im a threat and ive had enough <eos> wait just wait <eos> then they

for my pain <eos> why am i an honest man <eos> if i cant waste a minute on your name <eos> why am i an honest man <eos> if the worlds going to knock me on my face <eos> why am i an honest man <eos> if

up to reach you <eos> wherever you are <eos> i want you to know <eos> the world it means nothing <eos> if i cant share it with you <eos> you fell to your tomb <eos> and sank in your sleep <eos> called out for help <eos> no one could see <eos> the world it means nothing <eos> if i cant share it with you diamond rivers run in streaks <eos> down my lovers cheeks <eos> they run for weeks <eos> cut so

de mi corazon <eos> y esa fue mi <eos> equivocacion <eos> que yo te diera <eos> el corazon <eos> pues yo de ti <eos> me enamore <eos> sin pensar que un dia <eos> me pagaras con traicion <eos> y esa

tu no lo fuiste asi <eos> por que no te daba nada <eos> yo no se lo que querias <eos> por que amor si lo tenias <eos> por que amor si lo tenias <eos> pero otra cosa buscabas <eos> tu despreciabas mi amor <eos> aunque sabias que te amaba <eos> yo te di todo de mi <eos> pero yo no te importaba <eos> y arrida la sierra y hechale atardecer <eos> cuando te miro pasar <eos> se te nota en tu mirar <eos> que tu vives con tristeza <eos> aunque tengas un monton <eos> de dinero no hay amor <eos> se te nota no hay amor <eos> no estas feliz ni contenta <eos> ahora quieres regresar <eos> pero ya nada es igual <eos> ahora tengo quien me quiera <eos> no quiero ni tu amistad <eos> tu me mandaste a volar <eos> tu me mandaste a volar <eos> aunque sabias que te amaba <eos> tu despreciabas mi amor <eos> aunque sabias que te amaba <eos> eras todo para mi <eos> y sigues siendo mi amada que facil es <eos> decir te quiero cuando nada es cierto <eos> dificil es <eos> cuando recibes un fuerte desprecio <eos> una ilusion <eos> es la que tu le haz dejado a mi corazon <eos> y mis palabras se las ah llevado el viento <eos> tambien dije <eos> que aunque tu nunca nunca me quisiste <eos> yo te lleve <eos> hacia el camino que nunca emprendiste <eos> yo te ensee <eos> para que hoy digas que otro fue elque te enseo <eos> el camino del amor <eos> que conmigo nunca lo hiciste <eos> tarde entendi tu me <eos> engaaste y me traisionate <eos> pero yo no voy a llorar por que <eos> tu me dejaste mi corazon <eos> esta feliz por esas noche de <eos> placer y amor que con <eos> pasion tu a mi me entregaste era una tarde <eos> de primavera <eos> cuando hasta el alma <eos> se encuentra en flor <eos> yo diecisiete <eos> tu quinceanera <eos> tu colegiala <eos> y yo sonador <eos> y en aquel trigal <eos> el sol cayo

<eos> de primavera <eos> hoy es invierno <eos> y ya no hay flor <eos> el tiempo pasa <eos> quien lo dijer <eos> tu ama de casa <eos> y yo drogador <eos> y las mariposas <eos> volaban de flor en flor

ser amor <eos> y las mariposas <eos> y las mariposas <eos> y las mariposas <eos> volaban alrededor <eos> y nos enteramos por primera vez <eos> lo que ser amor nadie es eterno en el mundo <eos> ni teniendo un corazon <eos> que tanto siente why suspira <eos> por la vida why el amor <eos> todo lo acaban los anos <eos> dime que te llevas tu <eos> si con el tiempo no queda <eos> ni la tumba ni la

odlazim <eos> i tuan sam <eos> i nesretan <eos> jer je rekla moja mala <eos> da u ii sam nero with his axes <eos> and piles of skies gurgling <eos> behind him <eos> diocletian smiles <eos> and the garlands of meat fall tall <eos> who made the windmills <eos> and who made the whirlpools <eos> who made the crows <eos> and who made the stones <eos> who formed the foam <eos> from aleph the father <eos> behind the flowers <eos> the mother of the cows <eos> dreaming of trees <eos> in the colouring fields <eos> my face dissolves in folds <eos> and i disappear i am leaving when the leaves fall <eos> i am returning when the eyes open <eos> i am hidden when the eyes close <eos> i am between lips and lids <eos> my murder shuts quiet <eos> his sheets are shadows in the water <eos> and the histories are full of blinking <eos> and blurs <eos> i am hidden when the inken bird covers <eos> my youth and my back <eos> i was not there for you in the panic <eos> i was not there as the kitten died <eos> and i take this home with me <eos> i swallow your pain and stick blood into me <eos> suck moss and needles the faces of burrs <eos> the methodical false twilight <eos> and the gossip poured love like greedy beads <eos> like mirrors i am your face <eos> in the toilet in the kittenchen <eos> on the glassblue sea the birds see <eos> i am your mirror <eos> your echo is me <eos> in bells and birds that beauty i saw <eos> etched in clouds trailing <eos> making curtains of waves <eos> the broken face peeps <eos> he echoes "i am echo" <eos> i see you monster <eos> i see you monster <eos> my back and jaw hunch and feel <eos> you there <eos> you are the cuckoo the train the muffled drum <eos> you say "i am echo <eos> i am cleaner of floors <eos> sower of sores" <eos> and policeman in brambles and bubbles <eos> call the beauty to rest <eos> say "i am echo" <eos> and rise with peacocks <eos> feral and horizon <eos> the beauty moved over me <eos> and the beauty crashed down over my body <eos> with wine and dreams creeping down from the bookcases <eos> and saying "i am echo i am you speak me release me <eos> kill me and leave the cat to gd and rain and pussy willows" <eos> falling like paws and snowing tears and the voice shuts silent liar adam stands on docetic mountain <eos> the womans face is full of stars <eos> in the words of the book <eos> and with the lips of the book <eos> and the trumpet and the seal <eos> and the candlestick that lights <eos> up your bed with seeds and flowers <eos> and the lion on your rug <eos> thats roaring like a lamb <eos> on the rack and on its back <eos> i call the martyrs on wheels <eos> to this pisspoor mess <eos> and the blood spreading like flies <eos> under the table and the gable <eos> breathing curtains of eyes <eos> that shift uneasily <eos> and sniff like foxes at count <eos> with feathers following the mind <eos> that stitches quilts <eos> and pours cats into comets <eos> oh microwave oh galaxy kill <eos> all the night and its names <eos> on docetic drawn mountain <eos> my dragon arises <eos> scaling plastic christs <eos> with no back and no face <eos> he has stolen space <eos> and has solemn to spare <eos> and kisses mountains <eos> covered with useless snow <eos> for paise and for thekla <eos> under low volcanoes <eos> fearful wails to fall <eos> under his brothers <eos> and bloodface kills again <eos> and smothers the wheels <eos> drawing in the dirt <eos> there is ashkai <eos> under psychic attack since eight <eos> i saw the bells by the jar <eos> i saw the teeth in the jaw <eos> and saw the pale drains <eos> mind sinking empty wine <eos> useless in the heathen eden <eos> how great was the jungle <eos> dogs clutch heads and <eos> catch and call fall bulls <eos> murmuring like lovely streams <eos> that pulse and hurtle <eos> my clock shot shut anyway murder they say <eos> please murder <eos> my face was watching braille dogs <eos> hammering out belonging to the sky <eos> their wings form shutters <eos> from alans window <eos> the incense drifts past the skins and shells <eos> ruby waves goodbye <eos> and runs to the valleys <eos> that are beautiful <eos> and drenched with rain and colours <eos> and green was that blood then <eos> the sap of monsoons and butterflies <eos> when i was small the red flowers opened <eos> and i broke letters and dreamed <eos> or murder and nations and crowleys jazz <eos> or decades later <eos> i am some egyptian face <eos> was i in luxor carving my name <eos> was i binding cats with kindness and saws <eos> the green glass stinks with ash <eos> in the broken windows <eos> remembered bodies <eos> fill the streets with novels <eos> and the brave boys pass by <eos> in brave pontoons <eos> and mark graves <eos> with pebbles that sink and shriek jingles <eos> what was the lie in your showboat <eos> or your slowboat were the paperweights <eos> calling you to statis or murder <eos> was your soul at kostkutters or kwiksavers <eos> the cats lie under pink lights <eos> and see themselves as ponies with fur <eos> whilst judas arises centuries too late <eos> and says ecce homo an <eos> i was not the creator at the dawn or evening <eos> but the trains walk by to toytown <eos> and call for fares from the wooden front <eos> you and i were walking the calypso <eos> howling for teatime <eos> at teatime the conquistadors and matadors <eos> are salvators and astronauts <eos> the sea was bloody red and coupled with fury <eos> anyway murder they say <eos> anyway murder these are the dregs <eos> of last grains of the age <eos> may be the hourglass <eos> of earth covering earth <eos> but not in betlehem <eos> not in jerusalem <eos> not in chorazin <eos> and not in bethsaida <eos> we will not again see <eos> god humbled on an ass <eos> but see <eos> see <eos> on a white horse he comes <eos> blazing sword <eos> in in burning hand <eos> lo i am become death <eos> the destroyer of worlds <eos> his hands are backed up <eos> theyre straining at his neck <eos> what colour shall we rank in him <eos> what face shall we deliver him <eos> there may be the black dog <eos> there may be the white dog <eos> hitler comes as kalki <eos> kalki comes as hitler <eos> teeth teeth teeth teeth <eos> but meaningless lights <eos> still hold our attention <eos> we think that the holy books <eos> are written in blood and fire <eos> but what if its water <eos> the fires turned to blood <eos> the bloods turned to water <eos> and the waters turned to what <eos> milk piss lies dust <eos> hitler comes as kalki <eos> kalki comes as hitler <eos> everything becomes emptiness <eos> but goes through fire <eos> secret mother gsang yum chen mo <eos> secret father gsang yab chen po <eos> hitler becomes kalki <eos> kalki becomes hitler <eos> white horse and red horse <eos> christ twists on the cross <eos> hitler smiles in the guttering rubble <eos> he brings not peace but a sword <eos> and maybe the ocean roars immaculate <eos> maybe the stars fall incomprehensible <eos> oh these all tell me <eos> oh these all spell to me <eos> hitler as kalki <eos> kalki as hitler <eos> wheres your god now <eos> ill point out his varied forms to you <eos> one he hangs on the end of a tree <eos> two hes nailed to the arms <eos> of this selfsame tree <eos> and three he spins and soars <eos> and laughs through space <eos> one day the world sees <eos> oh one day the world sees <eos> hitler as kalki <eos> kalki as hitler <eos> and he lies matted <eos> half in time and half in space <eos> through the rising incense smoke <eos> i see him in the crowded room <eos> i see him crossing the mountain range <eos> if we see man at his most bloody <eos> if we see man at his most base <eos> shall we point then and there say <eos> this is reality this is his nature <eos> oh what makes the pain <eos> more real than the joy <eos> both are so mingled now <eos> and muddled together <eos> to pull them apart <eos> we butcher the essence <eos> and cripple its

space <eos> he rides between the spaces <eos> and he rides between the pain <eos> in the secret heart of becoming <eos> in the secret modes of darkness <eos> his eyes are now shuttered windows <eos> oh man man man man <eos> with his claws and his lies <eos> with his peace and his pain <eos> with his love and his sorrow <eos> with his candle of hope <eos> that stutters and dies <eos> no liberation through hearing <eos> when the sound of the worlds collapsing <eos> deafens deafens deafens our ears <eos> and pierces our heart <eos> hitler as kalki <eos> kalki as hitler <eos> rolling and roaring

<eos> all things merging <eos> and all things dissolving <eos> then stars collapse <eos> the vortex commences in space <eos> the rubble collects <eos> the debris gathers <eos> time starts to shiver <eos> my hearts blood <eos> if i dissolve into your body <eos> if i hoped to find <eos> whitelight in your soul <eos> if together we fall into forever <eos> would we not notice the turbulence <eos> that no longer waits <eos> first he comes <eos> from on a hill <eos> then hes running <eos> throughout the town <eos> then he stands <eos> devoid of peace <eos> devoid of place <eos> devoid of pity <eos> oh my dear christ <eos> carried broken from sad brown earth <eos> teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth <eos> hitler as kalki <eos> kalki as hitler i <eos> behind my walls are my cats and behind my cats is a peacock singing to me of my death and yours i said to her "in the silence of an eye i shall smile and arise and see someone i used to know sleeping in her room in her bed in her body i was in paradise" i am awake in the sound of roses and a young girls voice we are drowning in the approaching shadows i am dreaming and cannot hold it i have seen <eos> dear christ the silence and the loss we are born and fall dear christ you too are broken and lost and hanging like a roman standard over us all <eos> ii <eos> behind the line of my skull that hides behind my hair and skin i see the selfsame skull of my father and beyond the skull of my father the skull of my grandfather and the skull of my great grandfather whom i never knew and so on this line unto the alpha and omega point at infinity with my eye this fire this fly that sees everything and smiles and comprehends nothing and dies i see all around my head and that end i have invented myself i have created myself i am just a form of dream english words stretched with skin and fear from my eyes in my skull my father observes this immense and kaleidoscopic dream by birth i am other than this the mosquitoes rejoice in my skin the lizard is on the ceiling above me the shallow water pots deny the ants routes to food there is no silence ever the cicadas are omnipotent sound the kampong is dark and still i am not what i thought i was i am not what i seem most of all i am not what i am i thought it was the news rushing down the wires happy in death and fashion spinning yoyos and clacking its jaw raising its eyes mimicking dogs at play the sun shuts down and erases birdlight and in this stunted eclipse i saw myself some darkness at last tenously visible love as the sweetest thing al bowlly jack buchanan sing on dreaming of the lamps and the beautiful ladies bowed lips packed with blood the staged kisses trembling under the placid stars the coffee taken with cream and scones under the viennese moon whilst we are weighed we are judged and twist in this storm like birds over sails <eos> iii <eos> i have caught the dead again i click my eyes <eos> and there they are mercurial ghosts formed <eos> and moving so the dead do move and shout <eos> and pray and cry and suffer <eos> and the eye click on and one the one shut <eos> catches the dead the clouds pass by <eos> god hovers over us and shrieks <eos> we dont hear the slightest crackle <eos> cant see the slightest smiles <eos> and we blur into our death and the second great death <eos> whilst we chase chicks and dream of a paradise without wings or sorrow christs tears fall over jerusalem the curtains are groggy with damp and the rails and the tracks and the tacks and the black and the bats and the shrivelled shrill lights trip and laugh over the weeds and the blossoms and throats open shut and sigh i am the moon and the sun the rising and the setting the first and final breaths and the product of the stars i am some immortal and pointless dust <eos> two bodies lie in bed for their brief moment together in eternity the memory holds still we watch the fireflies kiss the night and turn their backs on the milky way forever as our eyes shower sweetness upon each other <eos> iv <eos> i caught a glimpse of your eyes <eos> last night in a restless dream <eos> awaking out of green field blue seas stars <eos> your eyes arose like the spectres of flowers <eos> i turned out the light and clicked fast the door <eos> the book fell <eos> i had so many thoughts so many signs <eos> i made sense of nothing at all <eos> this green dream was unreal the crickets sing <eos> across deserts and plains the lost feast <eos> whose shimmering teeth are marking the passing of time <eos> a cloud falls a bird shivers and sings its beak stained with night <eos> pure gold the dark is waiting the darkness is hungry <eos> the deep is angry and the telephone rings on <eos> a film screen descends and the silent movies play <eos> buster keaton falls and rots as big ben sings and boils <eos> on an endless swamp the silence is treacle thick <eos> and calls us to prayer paint god with your blood <eos> and fill haunted women with knives and kites <eos> and gauges and valves and make them weep long hymns <eos> to gaseous and clumsy mortality whilst fish descend <eos> remember remember the burning ember <eos> embedded in your chest the soul watches tv <eos> and gorges itself on blood and popcorn <eos> now thats what i call decay decline and hard times <eos> hard times very hard times mr lindsay <eos> hard times and winter so croool you have stopped my watch <eos> at the stroke of three and call for the police <eos> but theres a time for tea and a time for expiring <eos> and the notice to quit is in the post <eos> and you should know your <eos> little cow and calf is gonna die <eos> v <eos> i was awake dreaming <eos> of new dystopias to run to and hide within <eos> and new faces to wear <eos> and new bodies to inhabit <eos> and new lies to guzzle <eos> and how i loved <eos> the moon and its sheets of seeds <eos> the moon tiding in your body <eos> the smell of your blood breathing <eos> and its taste in the sea in the south shining my feet <eos> till it seemed as if they were made of dew <eos> with pearls of huge beauty <eos> whilst your mouselike breath was <eos> the hand upon my clock <eos> and one each breath i came nearer <eos> to my silly and shining end <eos> vi <eos> all long summer long <eos> under the flydance and the thumbthick twilight <eos> the thought of you smiling <eos> and laughing with children <eos> crippled me <eos> typecast and forlorn <eos> smudged ghost gorgeous <eos> there is a love so profound <eos> so broken and risen <eos> torment black valley <eos> slumbering between our lips <eos> and the lies we thoughtlessly wove <eos> i knew your essence once <eos> at our time when the sunset and i touched you <eos> in the slanting room just south of the past <eos> between your belly and thighs <eos> this was a temporary deceitful paradise <eos> lost as we created it <eos> and destroyed in tasting <eos> so much blood is lacking now <eos> i dreamt for your bit lips haunted like waves <eos> in the ecstatic arch of evening <eos> you and the night you and the mountain <eos> you and tomorrow you and the tomorrow <eos> stay away stay away stay away <eos> what we want we cannot have <eos> and wanting all the more <eos> i slept on words and lines and texts <eos> of useless want staring at the time <eos> and finally lost you finally finally lost you finally <eos> as the moon swept down and wept <eos> vii <eos> good morning how are you <eos> i have called to say <eos> i saw you dreaming of conquests <eos> of large wars bigger walls <eos> but <eos> i am pleased to say <eos> your houses are dead <eos> your children are full of flame <eos> the horses are dead and the butterflies fall <eos> god is abroad <eos> the wind is in the air <eos> and from the depths <eos> i point at us all <eos> good morning <eos> the clouds of smoke arise <eos> arise arise full of eyes of eyes <eos> your sons are suffocating their sisters <eos> and painting eyes on the walls <eos> with tongues dipped in blood <eos> arise arise full of eyes of eyes <eos> and from the depths <eos> i call to us all <eos> good morning <eos> i have seen the face that lies <eos> i have seen the lips that smile <eos> with false smiles arise arise <eos> look look i have read a book a book <eos> that has spelt out the future <eos> and from the depths <eos> i see a king arise arise <eos> with on his forehead many eyes eyes <eos> and he is on a horse a horse a horse <eos> with a train of smoke behind its hooves <eos> and i must say from my depths <eos> i have seen a story emerge from a cloud of wings <eos> arise arise from eyes from eyes <eos> and a number is ssseen is ssseen is ssseen <eos> from the depths beauty <eos> and from the depths loss <eos> from the depths from the depths <eos> i have called and added and have seen you all <eos> your children are dead and waiting for you <eos> viii <eos> the sun has already just set <eos> you said <eos> and behind it the moondfaced disc <eos> blue pearl white opaline mouth <eos> sack of hopes of dreams of fur <eos> catching the moths that <eos> trail dust in the dusk <eos> caused you to open alone and sign <eos> goodbye to us all in the white room <eos> in the eyewhite skullwhite room <eos> in the bed <eos> amongst the dead <eos> santa rita ora pro nobis <eos> i looked at you <eos> and touched the earth <eos> hid under concrete and cruelty <eos> credo quia impossibile est <eos> that the dead rise rise rise <eos> and in the blink in the twink <eos> of your eye santa rita <eos> i saw you dart dark as an eclipse <eos> whilst the twilight made a rainbow <eos> all around your passing <eos> and i saw and was saved <eos> ix <eos> in dream <eos> you are there <eos> as the tip of the tongue collapses towards the teeth <eos> and the waters of dream mass around <eos> you are there you are there <eos> suddenly and silently <eos> you are the force of the wave <eos> and birds all birds reel in the distance <eos> their face at dawn <eos> where profound and terrible armies surge <eos> and foreign towns collapse under the weight of prophesied terrors <eos> all the dead advance great armies <eos> martyrs for the blood the sign the wound <eos> and time <eos> the animals all sorted fishes too <eos> i have eaten judge me at <eos> gods right hand <eos> and the cats that arise from the dirt and the filth <eos> and the starving and the scabby <eos> the tortured the tortured the tortured <eos> i see them at night before i drift <eos> during my sleep they gambol and play <eos> and chase balls or children or giants <eos> they play cards and click their eyes <eos> they laugh and take tea at six <eos> they laugh as they tumble <eos> and have teeth the size of cloudbursts <eos> and grip us and take us down to the deep <eos> and we sigh and expire and <eos> seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <eos> silenceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <eos> sssssssssmilliiiiiiiiiiiiinggggggggggggggg <eos> i cannot bear this all any more not enough silence but in the desert i sometimes see ships and hear the black diamond express near the station before mine caesar where are you going he said to me grinning <eos> you will reach the kingdom <eos> with a bow and a sweep <eos> you will reach the kingdom <eos> i have caught and tortured time <eos> and i arise <eos> we are surrounded for the last years by a vast empire of death and empire of blood this was all after the crucifixion <eos> i uflow tou yeou plhrhw xaritow kai elhyeiaw <eos> so try to remove whatever may dream or spill or seed or spread on your breath <eos> or your silence will seep into the something you wished to avoid <eos> it will be seen some fine day all right yes all right <eos> "i will make you mine" just you and i whilst our breaths pass between us and spiral off to mausoleums of desires and hopes <eos> when my friends pass into the great goodbye before my eyes <eos> and i too move with them without sound just words <eos> left floating through the streets and the ears <eos> and the souls of the people who were with me i was in them <eos> and they were in me and off they go a pint in their hands <eos> a glint in their eye and i see tambourines drearily clapping out <eos> the pavine carnival march "now you seeem now you dont" <eos> i did not want the world to stop and i have seen it rush past me <eos> as a ferocious fury but such angelic fury and i was taking the temperature of a thousand changes of mind i might take you now but perhaps i shall wait till the postman comes for toast and with notes of the obsequies at <eos> with your teeth on edge at the faint sound of the swans charging at the trees that you built swings on and killed under and dreamt under <eos> with your beloved in that first and last virginal summer <eos> when you entered this world of blood and belief <eos> and coupled under the tropical sun <eos> and gave birth to children in your cries <eos> i am born to die <eos> i am born to die <eos> i am born to die <eos> "jesus snorted he was moved to his guts" and the dust was everywhere and pilate arose in his fury you have a boat waiting friend and it is time to board all aboard all aboard "we dont save the living here" the cyclamen opens at evening and the world was gentle tonight summery hints of rose and rouge in the sky in the north over the dome of the glassgreenhouse pilate arose and washed his hands i washed my hands i cleared dust of them i can see specks of blood laughing upon them pilate washes his hands he arose and washed his hands and the sword fell <eos> meanwhile in the house with nothing at home in the cafe with plates of liver and kidneys and offal in the slaughterhouse near the schoolyard in the damaged rooms of the schoold maam at rest in the fallen arches of the brilliant silence coloured at dawn and twilit by the twittering of birds in the moon shining down on the shrew on my step at the freshly cut grass at the sound of the bell making toast or tea or time buzz by with loud whoops of shouting "i am here i am there catch me if you can catch me if you dare" at all these moments and all these daydreams and all our breaths which dream idly into deaths deaths at all these deaths i remember you beautiful with love and fear with swooping hair biting the words our of your mind and delivering them to me hating to pass the time which swept by as proud as a ghost whilst we tossed coins to see who would disappear first and then when then i die <eos> i feel i shall say <eos> i have not understood <eos> i have not understood any of this <eos> my eyes are still coaldark <eos> i have not understood <eos> around and in my eyes the tiny flecks <eos> of swirling crippled confused lights <eos> and to my heart i will whisper <eos> softly quietly <eos> "there is no death there is no death" <eos> and goodbye to you all <eos> under the gorgon grinned arches <eos> of londons great vaults <eos> i have not understood <eos> under the sunpuckered roofs <eos> of kathmandu <eos> i have not understood <eos> along the soulstoned streets <eos> of lower <eos> and of higher germanie <eos> i have not understood <eos> leipzig blackeyed pain and loss she <eos> i have not understood <eos> in clare near i <eos> the empty lakes are open in the distance <eos> and too close is the famineretchingroad <eos> all these are ghosts <eos> there i have not understood <eos> in the heart of the wood <eos> oh there i have understood <eos> i rested at the temple of great black time her <eos> and did not understand <eos> though animalbled fleshmarbled rivers ran in her honour <eos> his buckled body in blood <eos> returns to the prebirth poise <eos> spreadeagled like starfish <eos> there in his eyes <eos> incomprehension mute pain disbelief what <eos> blood there meant sorrow trickles there <eos> this i could not understand <eos> i bend the pages of yet another book <eos> and in its lines great black lines <eos> i have not understood <eos> please gramercy pray for me <eos> and oh goodbye sweetestheart <eos> the wind roars in the nearness <eos> and there in my heart <eos> and all the clouds are spiralling towards us <eos> descent indeed to the centre of it all <eos> skipping lightly and lying truly <eos> this we shall understand <eos> i hope <eos> we bent humped trees <eos> the great ones there <eos> on the lapped shore <eos> dai ichi <eos> there also i do not know <eos> this is all unknowable <eos> and as the dust covers <eos> my empty eyes <eos> you shall read in these foolish gapes <eos> oh that i have not understood <eos> but if you look for the stag and cross conjoined <eos> there on my arm look there <eos> there i have understood very well <eos> now you are all fading <eos> all fading <eos> as my age creeps on <eos> as this age stumbles on <eos> fires in the earth <eos> fires in the sky <eos> fires in our hearts <eos> fires everywhere <eos> the black eyes <eos> already blacken <eos> and this i have not understood <eos> not peace <eos> but a sword <eos> this and he <eos> unfortunately <eos> i have understood <eos> under the bowered greenwood tree <eos> when first i lay <eos> bright starre with thee <eos> under the velvet branches dear <eos> when sun and moon both came so near <eos> under the starlit open dome <eos> under the starsharp pointed lights <eos> under the starloved greeny earth <eos> when first i wanted to hold you <eos> and all the world halfdead and halflive <eos> spat into my mouth <eos> bluesea bitterwater <eos> and i am almost dead <eos> and i have not understood <eos> under the rain and teeth of gods <eos> under the pain and sleeping liddy eyes <eos> under the brokkèd wetful heaven <eos> if you are there <eos> if you are there <eos> if you are there <eos> then i am singing with my eyes <eos> if you are there so this empire is nothing <eos> before me the green fields are stretched out <eos> the broken body of a cat glows there <eos> and the shimmering flies fall <eos> this empire is nothing <eos> i said "i guess this isnt real" <eos> this empire is not real <eos> i cannot hang words on the silence <eos> everywhere gods goldenlight <eos> s said "you have appeared to me for a reason" <eos> and i said to her <eos> "who do you say i am" <eos> like one better before around me i stand on the shore <eos> the waters are black and swirling <eos> i hold a black mirror in my hands <eos> the swastiked winds sweep around me <eos> their arms the nightbreath sleepwalking <eos> the sighing of imminence and ending <eos> all there the waves curl under and over <eos> around me i see things coming to a close <eos> the door is nearly shut <eos> as we stare at it the tinylight squeaks out <eos> slower and slower <eos> i see things coming to a close <eos> the folding cerecloth shrugs down over the windows <eos> the lights burn still but invisible to us now <eos> i see things coming to a close <eos> my mind kissed myrinerest last night <eos> i dreamt <eos> i cannot see <eos> i cannot see <eos> i can no longer see <eos> and nor would i want to <eos> anymore <eos> clearblindlayeredlightcolourblindeathcomecomecomecome <eos> goaway <eos> the pale toothed face inverted <eos> at the feet of the

then the rain <eos> "my pain beneath your sheltering hand" <eos> he cried <eos> and gave himself up to the tempter <eos> the rebel angels he thought and knew <eos> would indeed array him with robes of

<eos> les plis de sa robe pourprée <eos> et son teint au vôtre pareil <eos> las voyez comme en peu despace <eos> mignonne elle a dessus la place <eos> las las ses beautés laissé choir <eos> o vraiment marâtre est nature <eos> puisquune telle fleur ne dure <eos> que du matin jusques au soir <eos> donc si vois me croyez mignonne <eos> tandis que votre âge fleuronne <eos> en sa plus verte nouveauté <eos> cueillez votre jeunesse <eos> comme à cette fleur la vieillesse <eos> fera ternir votre beauté <eos> "the old willows wrecked again and again in the hold of the woods held <eos> in close confinement all round into the struggle for existance where <eos> the streams were constantly taken from their course by the roots of the <eos> old trees in the woods allowing no mill stream the free course through <eos> until the whole of these fine old trees had got their whole water <eos> course directed by their own roots into each others roots in their own <eos> devious ways so each time the bad weather conditions came the dell of <eos> the old popular willows received the whole rainfall gave the roots of <eos> the old popular trees the worst conditions they could not recover from <eos> the result was when the bad storms swept the ground downhill the whole <eos> of the upright branches of the populars were wrecked wrenched off as <eos> none had sufficient root hold to do any good in holding as against the <eos> winds forcing both root trunks branches to give way the ultimate <eos> result was as stated the cracking down of the branches the breaking <eos> off of the main trunk as it had no side branches to help its leaves to <eos> support the whole tree this gave the stubble growth of enforcing the <eos> trunk low down near the ground to spray out the small side branches <eos> to develope in the trunk the further strength to enlarge the top of the <eos> trunk to enable the heavy branch growth to develop to give out a <eos> large number of spray branches in all directions to keep control of the <eos> wind and also to stop the wind from further to destroy the old trees in <eos> its course the winds followed the well streams then got the clear run <eos> free of the trees until a run of heavy old tree trunks guided them out <eos> again into the ground where the rising ground destroyed them by holding <eos> them in face clear of the winds the night mist" then i looked into her young eyes <eos> from eighty years she looks back <eos> into my young eyes <eos> and she is gone <eos> to where <eos> where has her soul gone <eos> body found yes <eos> but her very mark her sign <eos> lost it seems to me now <eos> though i feel that she is here still <eos> all around me windsouled <eos> to love is always to live somehow <eos> as long as our eyes are still this colourdull glass <eos> i will not know her still <eos> this parched scorched earth <eos> endless wheel of suffering <eos> great ocean of pain <eos> bloodbucket of grief <eos> roaring mouthgaped o <eos> of disappointment and despair <eos> will not then exist <eos> and we shall smile <eos> we shall smile as big <eos> as the big crescent moon <eos> which lies on its arched back and dreams <eos> of cats and stars and snow <eos> and as before we saw smiley shining stars <eos> and disreaching them <eos> our arms would wave like a desperate windmill <eos> hoping hoping to welcome them home <eos> now we shall touch them close to our hearts <eos> and what we are <eos> and what we may be <eos> maybe <eos> why i have failed <eos> and all i could have been <eos> and am not <eos> and all i had hoped for <eos> and were not <eos> and everything i hoped <eos> and hoped and hoped and hoped for <eos> i prayed in the morning <eos> and i prayed in the evening <eos> and i got not <eos> from the rotgut god <eos> when all the world starts to shiver <eos> and shimmer and shake all around me <eos> and all the worldlight was piecemeal <eos> and peaceless <eos> this is the atomic pain of the worlds <eos> the molecular tears <eos> the final crystalline structure of misery <eos> that winds its way around the wooden snakejawed growing spine <eos> of the worlds <eos> listen i was taken <eos> to be betrayed whenever is hate <eos> to be betrayed wherever is hate <eos> as the body is abused by man <eos> there in the patrapassion edge of the world <eos> the hanging god is invaded <eos> in heart and soul <eos> i suffer you all suffer <eos> you suffer all i suffer <eos> suffer suffer suffer suffer <eos> the tearblowing world creaks around <eos> and we are broken loss <eos> loss <eos> light and darkness <eos> light and darkness <eos> it seems to the little blue and green world <eos> that they do not know each other <eos> but they must finally <eos> the master says that satan too shall be forgiven <eos> forgiven <eos> and suffering before <eos> we suffer too <eos> heres sixpence <eos> heres sixpence <eos> go and play and play <eos> in the flaky pale fields that still are somehow this land <eos>

you know that were not going back to where we have been this road will show us theres a place where you and me can begin to say the things that weve been meaning to say now its time to burn your bridges away <eos> fading out with the daylight the worry on your mind now the fight has turned to flight but well make it out alive so leave it all lets go cause well risk everything we know to reach the other side <eos> we have just the lives we lead to show this world what we believe find out now who you will be maybe right now this is the best that youve found to live a life thats tearing you down day by day maybe right now you cant seem to find a way out and youre afraid to trust in the sound of your own voice so listen <eos> runaway were gonna write our perfect story all the way until the end runaway if you think something else is waiting follow me until the end <eos> so where do you go when all of the places you know they no longer feel like a home when theres no painted road to lead you to where you should be could you find the strength to believe that more is waiting if you just leave this life behind and choose today to <eos> sometimes you just dont know but theres a risk worth taking to find the life thats waiting so dont be afraid to make a choice let go ill be right here waiting for you you were never alone when i look at you how could you look at me im thinking now all that you are is much more than ill ever be it seems today ill never catch a break im feeling like all that i am is all the mistakes that ive made <eos> youre you far away inside of memories but when i listen you say <eos> what do you have to fear when youre left all alone in the darkest of days when the nights growing cold youre safe in the arms of a love all your own in the darkest of your days theres a love that you should know <eos> i remember when we were innocent now theyre telling us all that we are is all of the places weve been when the seconds slow and youre standing on your own youll start coming back into the arms of love that you shouldve known <eos> when youre feeling lost and your hope is gone your scars never seem to fade but there is more to you there is more to me <eos> the past doesnt change a thing here we are again where all that i am is never enough to bring me the truth so i turn to you to make me complete and justify me <eos> so ill hold on to you if you hold on to me <eos> hold on to me when all that you see is falling apart right at the seams when youre at the end of your rope just hold on to me why cant you see im falling apart right at the seams im hanging by a thread <eos> a heart and a soul are caught between bones the emptiness it rings when i am alone somehow i know the words that you speak could never save me <eos> but ill hold on to you if you hold on to me <eos> when you hold on to me why cant you see im falling apart right at the seams i hold on to you like you hold on to me but were falling apart now i thought you were the only one that id ever see but you werent the one to show me what it meant to believe <eos> i thought that we had found a home but now i walk alone <eos> with you or without you i have waited for so long and now we must say goodbye for the last time cause we are two hearts one world apart <eos> i thought we knew it better but took the fruit from the vine nothing can last forever but we thought that we could try we sealed our fate together when i put faith in your eyes now what we had together breathes its last breath tonight <eos> ill go on but we have reached the end iemand zei "dit is annabel <eos> ze moet nog naar t station <eos> neem jij de wagen dan haalt ze het wel" <eos> ik zei "das goed" en reed zo stom als ik kon <eos> we kwamen aan bij een leeg perron <eos> en ik zei "het zit je niet mee" <eos> heel in de verte ging de laatste wagon <eos> en annabel zei "okee ik ga met je mee" <eos> en later lagen we samen zoals dat heet <eos> een beetje moe maar voldaan <eos> er kwam al licht door de ramen ze zei <eos> "geen tijd voor ontbijt ik moet gaan" <eos> ik zei alleen nog "tot ziens annabel" <eos> en ik dacht "die zie ik nooit meer terug" <eos> ik dacht ik draai me om en slaap nog even door <eos> maar twee uur later was ik nog wakker lag stil op mn rug <eos> annabel het wordt niets zonder jou annabel <eos> annabel het wordt niets zonder jou annabel <eos> zo bleef ik twee dagen liggen in bed <eos> ik was totaal van de kaart <eos> toen stond ik op ik moest niet denken maar doen <eos> want zonder haar was ik geen stuiver meer waard <eos> ik liep de stad door op zoek naar een glimp <eos> en ik dacht "ik zie haar nooit meer terug" <eos> ik ging zelfs hardop praten in mezelf <eos> en iemand zei "je stond uren met je handen op de leuning van de brug" <eos> ahah <eos> annabel het wordt niets zonder jou annabel <eos> annabel het wordt niets zonder jou annabel <eos> toen op een avond zag ik haar weer <eos> ze stapte net op de tram <eos> ze was nog mooier dan de vorige keer <eos> ik riep haar naam en trapte hard op mn rem <eos> ik sprong de auto uit en greep haar vast <eos> ze stond stil en keek om <eos> ze keek me aan maar was nauwelijks verrast <eos> en ik zei "hee waar moet je naartoe" ze zei "naar het station" <eos> ik bracht haar weg ze kocht een kaartje parijs <eos> en ik zei "en nog erbij" <eos> de lokettist gaf tweemaal enkele reis <eos> en annabel keek even opzij <eos> ik zei "ik heb je gevonden vandaag <eos> en ik laat je nooit meer alleen <eos> al reis je door naar barcelona of praag <eos> al reis je door naar het eind van de wereld ik ga met je mee hee" onder de groene hemel in de blauwe zon <eos> speelt het blikken harmonieorkest in een grote regenton <eos> daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos <eos> de lange stoet de bergen in van het circus jeroen bosch <eos> en we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal <eos> want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land <eos> van maas en waal <eos> ik loop gearmd met een kater voorop <eos> daarachter twee konijnen met een trechter op hun kop <eos> en dan de grote snoeshaan die legt een glazen ei <eos> wanneer je t schudt dan sneeuwt t op de egmondse abdij <eos> ik reik een meisje mijn koperen hand <eos> dan komen er twee moren met hun slepen in de hand <eos> dan blaast er de fanfare ter ere van de schaar <eos> die trouwt met de vingerhoed ze houden van elkaar <eos> en onder de purpren hemel in de bruine zon <eos> speelt nog steeds het harmonieorkest in een grote regenton <eos> daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos <eos> de lange stoet de bergen in van het circus jeroen bosch <eos> en we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal <eos> want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land <eos> van maas en waal <eos> we zijn aan de koning van spanje ontsnapt <eos> die had ons in zijn bed en de provisiekast betrapt <eos> we staken alle kerken met brandewijn in brand <eos> t is koudvuur dus t geeft niet en het komt niet in de krant <eos> het leed is geleden de horizon schijnt <eos> wanneer de doden dronken zijn en pierlala verdwijnt <eos> dan steken we de loftrompet en ook de dikke draak <eos> en eten s avonds zandgebak op t feestje bij klaas vaak oh oh you love me i know you care shut we never we not be there you on my love you are my heart and we hoy es el utimo intento <eos> hoy aceptã© que perdã­ <eos> que hago con todos los sueã±os <eos> que imagine junto a ti <eos> ya casi estã¡n tus maletas <eos> se muy bien que esta vez no regresas <eos> por eso quiero que nos abracemos antes que cierres la puerta <eos> para darnos el ãºltimo beso <eos> y llevarnos por siempre el recuerdo <eos> de un inmenso amor que sin darnos cuenta nos dijo adios <eos> ahora que te vas como se lo explico a mi corazã³n <eos> para darnos el ãºltimo beso y despedir nuestro amor con respecto <eos> si hasta el dia de hoy no pude lograr hacerte feliz <eos> aunque yo comprendo tu decisiã³n te quiero pedir <eos> un ãºltimo beso <eos> ya casi estã¡n tus maletas <eos> se muy bien que esta vez no regresas <eos> por eso quiero que nos abracemos antes que cierres la puerta <eos> para darnos el ãºltimo beso <eos> y llevarnos por siempre el recuerdo <eos>

dia de hoy no pude lograr hacerte feliz <eos> aunque yo comprendo tu decisiã³n te quiero pedir <eos> un ãºltimo beso this is not my day <eos> everything looks like being in slow motion <eos> but ill try to change my faith today my destiny today <eos> take a good look around <eos> what the hell am i doing here <eos> wanna drown in the deep yellow brown ocean <eos> where i really can for a moment forget <eos> i realize that all this shit <eos> disappeared the night before this hang over <eos> the bad thing is that memories appear again <eos> so again ill fall apart <eos> this is not my night <eos> by the way i dont remember a thing at all <eos> maybe a heavy night of drinking can turn into a beautiful song <eos> but im not in the mood of playing something new <eos> i realize that all this shit <eos> disappeared the night before this freaking hang over <eos> the bad thing is that memories appear again <eos> so again ill fall apart i hear no voices telling me what to do <eos> my heart is broken <eos> and i feel too small when i am by your side <eos> i dont know what to say <eos> bad luck surround us <eos> i should accept i was just something you used when you felt down <eos> i know i am stupid cause i stay around <eos> and i wish you walked away <eos> you walked in the rain <eos> i cooked something to eat <eos> you came all the way down when i was here <eos> trying to tell me <eos> stay away cause she is not real <eos> she reads about nature in magazines <eos> and i wish you walked away <eos> you dont know how it feels to have the chance of telling all about these secrets i kept inside <eos> and screw it all by staying in silence <eos> and i wish you walked away <eos> and i wish you walked away <eos> and i wish you walked away <eos> and i wish i walked away it so happens that the mattress is empty today <eos> and the bed is unmade <eos> light has come but you are gone <eos> i just thought you were here but you were not <eos> so i shrouded the footsteps you left in the air <eos> and clang to the shadow reflected on the wall <eos> then i read some invisible words you wrote on the floor <eos> and in time you are outside the world <eos> think once then twice <eos> before you pretend you know what to say <eos> grab the sound of wind <eos> and follow the flight of seagulls that go to the south <eos> i will hang some sings on a fence <eos> i will burn some wood by a lake <eos> until i comprehend that perhaps it is not too bad to be hit by a feast <eos> if it makes you strong <eos> and teaches you how to forget <eos> you know i will leave it all behind if you tell me to <eos> i wont be waiting for you by the sea <eos> the sea you already dry <eos> you better go with the seagull <eos> i wont be waiting for you by the sea <eos> the sea you already dry <eos> the sea you already dry if you were a melody im quite sure you would be in a movie <eos> where the characters look lovely and the plot is about romance <eos> you would sound right there in the climax scene <eos> where all the problems of those characters seem to disappear <eos> we share our secrets no more <eos> and i havent heard about sad sad stories <eos> about the past or happy moments of today <eos> oh i wonder what are you doing now <eos> oh what am i gonna do <eos> if you were a melody im quite sure you would be in a movie <eos> where the characters look lovely and the plot is about romance <eos> you would sound right there in the climax scene <eos> where all the problems of those characters seem to disappear <eos> oh i wonder what are you doing now <eos> oh you wonder what i am doing now <eos> oh i wonder what i am doing now <eos> oh what am i gonna do i wish this air could clean my chest <eos> i needed a quiet day <eos> i take a walk outside my house <eos> a freezy haze is freezing my head <eos> and i still myself <eos> i saw my hands into the ground <eos> the rain is hard behind my door <eos> the rain is covering my eyes <eos> i wish it could clean my sight <eos> and i still myself <eos> so i still myself <eos> really needed a quiet day <eos> really needed to hear my voice <eos> i wish this air could clean my chest <eos> i wish the rain could clean my sight where have all people gone <eos> where is your skin when im in this bed lying <eos> my shoes seem covered with snow <eos> and i used your words to keep them dry <eos> im miles away but i feel you here <eos> im far away but closer than yesterday <eos> cotton is floating and i use it to build a castle <eos> its weak and fake and useless like <eos> some of the stories ive told to my friends <eos> and ill play a song to keep you awake <eos> and im weightless so i will let the wind take me where you are dont wanna know if i miss you <eos> dont wanna know if you do <eos> we both felt home once being alone <eos> and now i see yours shoes soaked <eos> i shouldve stay cause the world didnt matter <eos> i shouldve stay cause the world didnt matter <eos> and i pictured your eyes <eos> and dwelled on your name <eos> but you fell in love with a tree <eos> you fell in love with a tree <eos> dont you dare say i didnt want to go and hold you <eos> dont you dare say i didnt want to go <eos> covered with dust <eos> lifted by the air <eos> covered with dust <eos> lifted by your breath <eos> and i pictured your eyes <eos> and dwelled on your name <eos> but you fell in love with a tree <eos> you fell in love with a tree <eos> and i fell in love with a girl <eos> but you never saw that i was in love with that girl in love with a tree my head is silent <eos> sensations change with every other person who passes me by <eos> windy days remove the leaves that fall has left on empty streets and now they fly like birds <eos> its getting cold and monday is blue but suddenly the sun has risen in this crowded lonely city im getting urges to <eos> theres water on the sidewalk and some huge grey clouds perfectly mirror down my feet <eos> my head down slowly change its posture and now i look straight at someone i recognize as a theft <eos> leaves have fallen and stay as part of the ground <eos> my movements seem slower cause fear dangerously approached <eos> hey what are the chances <eos> hey how in the world i came to this <eos> must i get rid of this <eos> today this place is full of broken umbrellas <eos> people are running fast to be under a roof <eos> the air inside my lungs is clear but you polluted the time and the quietude i was supposed to be in now
